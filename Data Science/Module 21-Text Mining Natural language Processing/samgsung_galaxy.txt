['\nBest camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance,  best display.\n', "\nThis is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n", '\n3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.\n', '\nDear Amazon & samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.Rear Camera getting blur in low light.\n', '\nLets just begin with the obvious. This phone\'s quality doesn\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\'s Policy: In case you don\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day "return" policy to 10 day "replacement" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\n', "\nI am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality\n", '\nSoftware is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option.\n', '\nsupb phone\n', '\nGood phone\n', "\nPhone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  . Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB. Don't waste your time and money .\n", '\nI found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.\n', '\nI ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex\n', "\nWorst experience ever, camera quality not better 5out of 2, battery down very fast, max 3 hours taken charging 100% ,sometime WhatsApp hangups.108 gp free storage but mobile heating high, fingerprints only 3 finger available,  not better fingerprints,  I am the first buyer before launching. Over all don't buy this m 31. No extra protection, no additional option,  very simple mobile,not worthiness of money,\n", '\nCons:1. No notifications light.2. Large icons.3. No preinstalled app lock. You can install s secure to achieve that but lock symbols will be there on each locked app.4. Ringtone volume not so loud.5. No back cover provided.6. Camera is not that great as expected with 64mp.Pros:1. Screen quality2. Ram management3. Smooth performance4. Battery performance. After 12 hrs of usage, still having 60 % remaining battery (5 hours screen on time).5. Looks are pretty good.6. Samsung brand.\n', "\nVery bad mobile. Heating and hanging problem. Amazon not refunding even having mobile problem. Don't buy this mobile. Go for Redmi mobile. Camera  quality is  worst. Many thing's not  supported. Anyone want to take this mobile please let me know. Reduce some amount. Buy before 7 days. Only  battery is good other is worst. Samsung  must quit in making mobile.\n", '\nThe camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually\n', "\nUpdate 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.\n", '\nCamara is too bad. Sound clarity is not at all good ... though it looks like a premium phone ,but when you started using it makes you feel that you bought a cheap quality product. Gets frequently stuck and restarts for no reason.\n', "\nI was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.\n", "\nApart from battrey and screen nothing is good. Front facing camera as per specs is of 32mp. But when u go for high resolution it show 21MP... TOTALLY CRAP. My samsung j7's 8mp is FAR MORE BETTER THAN this one in terms of front camera. FRAUD BY SAMSUNG.Finger prnt reader is not able to detect most of the times.\n", "\nFirst... I would like to express my experience of this mobile is tooooooo worst.... It's never performed like 6GB Ram Mobile.... It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...\n", "\nOrdered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.\n", "\nA great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.\n", "\nDisappointed  with Samsung, after many year I decided  to back to Samsung but  truly disappointed. Worst part of Amazon policy now you can't return at alll moreover not even replace easily,  you need to install the app then you will surprise  all the problems you face shall be found ok in the software. You will be in difficult to face the situation. My strong recommendation not to go with Samsung M31.\n", "\nDear all pls don't pay this product.

Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.Many scratches at back after 2 months usage.Material is just not very good.I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.Processor is slow.

I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It\'s unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn\'t delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.\n', "\nOut of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels).Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones.Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardwareFinally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands.Infact my first samsung phone.While configuration, received security patch and UI updatesFrom user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefullySuper happy user since 3days.

Not sure what happened to Samsung and Amazon India standards of leadership and customer first.\n', "\nI thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.\n", "\nPoor camera and display quality. Its not a 64 MP camera it's  quality is like 8 MP camera. Flash is not working in 64 MP ratio.And Amazon is also not returning this item. Vivo gives more quality in this price range. Now a days Samsung is selling it's name only not quality. Don't buy this.\n", "\nHi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products\n", "\nI have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!\n", "\nVery poor quality, phone touch stopped responding on few areas suddenly. Didn't expected this from Samsung. I am not able to use from a month.. :(Tried connecting customer service and they asked to go service center when it opens after lockdown. On asking whether my warranty period would be extended due to this, they completely denied.. I am feeling cheated now. :((Don't buy this phone !!\n", "\nSamsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?\n", "\nThe phone looks and feels good in the hand. All the gimmicks while setting up the phone would make one feel happy about buying the phone. Now let's get to the tall claims by Samsung basis which one has spent 17K.First of all I received a phone which when switched on went directly to system reboot mode. That was the first shock! The others are described next.Finger print reader is slow at times and one has to place the finger a couple of times to unlock the phone.Battery Life is lower than a 3000mah. Yes, one would get a longer battery life out of this phone if left unused and that is precisely what it hasn't been purchased for.Camera Quality is bad, very bad. The pictures are so grainy and pixelated. Had a Moto G4 plus before this and the picture quality from the camera was awesome.Feel cheated by Samsung for palming off such poor quality device for INR 17K. I want a refund.Amazon, I am aware that this review will go through a review by your team. Please take note and help initiate a return and refund so that I can buy a better device worth its value. Tganks!\n", '\nFair review after one week of usage:Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.6. Battery life is quite very good.7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.5. The charging is a bit slow.6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.7. The sound output could have been more.8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.\n', "\nThere are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.Battery- long backup, even if u play games.

If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device.

And not suport to fast charging and I receive this phone without charger . Charger is missing in the box .  total west of money\n', "\nI was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked...Can we replace with M30s?...\n", "\nBattery is very poor. It is draining at a rate of 6% per hour. I didn't expect such a poor product from samsung. Moreover, while charging for even half n hour phone heated up. It restarted by it's own after following troubleshoot procedure also.\n", "\nAwesome  screen .Awesome battery  .Awesome  cameras .Specially  ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung  is superb. I used Samsung  Galaxy  alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being  back to Samsung ... it's  worth it .Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing  at this price . No one can beat it .Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .Just go for it .1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .\n", "\nPurchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\n", '\nI can\'t believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I\'d need to pay if anything is broken. What\'s the warranty for? I asked what\'s the "Gorilla Glass" for if it couldn\'t handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, "We are insiders. So we understand these things, there\'s no such thing as "gorilla vorilla" it\'s a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you\'ll have to pay for this."I can\'t believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this "insider" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.\n', "\nThe Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.\n", "\nVery bad product.

I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.\n', "\nI bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.\n", "\nThe mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.\n", '\nThis mobile phone is the best budget and promising phone from Samsung.

It has 84.1% screen-to-body ratio. The screen has a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The screen quality is just superb. And as it is Super AMOLED so it consumes less battery than regular IPS displays.PROCESSOR, RAM, AND OPERATING SYSTEM:-This phone has Exynos 9611 Octa-core Processor (10nm based) clocked at 2.3GHz and Mali-G72 MP3 GPU.

It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.Now coming to the phone :Pros :-1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)\n', "\nAfter complainingSame issue of reboot doesn't solvedLoud speaker quality is very poorSound output is extremely lowOn full volume too....\n", '\nSamsung is now in a position to effectively counter the Chinese Cheap phones that are flooding Indian market in this price segment.This phone has following advantages and problems-1.Samsung Galaxy M31 has a good display even though the refresh rate is mediocre.2.The Processor is very good in this price range and I have satisfactory played PUBG in higher setting(the phone did get warm after 15 minutes).3.The  64 MP Camera is better than Redmi 8 pro in daylight condition, with few \'grains\' in low light condition.4.Amazon prime videos  and Netflix ran buttersmooth .5.The front camera is \'above average\'.6.The build quality is "above average" and acceptable in this price range.7.Packaging and delivery is superfast and excellent.In these days of Chinese aggression against India, Samsung is the better choice for tech savvy Indians.We must not allow ourselves to be duped into purchasing Suspicious phones of Chinese origin.\n', '\nVery very disappointed about the quality of the product...used only for 10 days...then a black spot started appearing in the back camera..visited Samsung Garia service centre.They denied to replace the product as I have purchased it online..However they took my complain and advised that they will change the camera but that is a time consuming matter.really disappointed after investing hard earned money in Samsung...very very poor quality product..\n', '\nLet’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera ReviewThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.Galaxy M31That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security ReviewGalaxy M31The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance ReviewGalaxy M31The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.\n', "\nBattery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.Facial recognition takes a lot of timeConclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme\n", "\nOverall amazing product from Samsung in this price range.Processor is well optimized, felt no lag,Amazing battery life, casual users can make it up to 2-3 days easilyGood ui, camera okay okay, fast fingerprint reader.Wifi Bluetooth connectivity good.Good video calling quality too.And great amoled screen.No heating issues as of now.If they put snapdragon processor as well nothing can match this as the best mid-range phone available online unlike flash sale products only rivalled by it's own successor M21.\n", "\n1. Camera is not up to the expectation2. Battery doesn't seem to be 6000 Mah it hardly last 1 day further takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to get fully charged worried if this is huge battery life and fast charging, what will be the normal one from Samsung.Hope the company have test check the features, if not kindly do it to get the correct facts.Other brands which are way smaller than the samsung brand offer better performance.\n", "\nWriting this review after 10 days of usage.Pros:1. Samsung's Super AMOLED Screen2. Massive 6000 mAh battery3. 64 MP Quad Camera4. One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box5. Dolby Atmos SupportCons:1. Exynos 9611 is fair enough to handle the daily work but it's a little old processor, it would be better if it would come with any of the latest ones.2. Fingerprint sensor is adequately fast but it's a capacitive and back mounted. It would be better if it would have in display one.3. The phone has a massive 6000 mAh battery and it supports fast charging only upto 15 watt. It would be better if would support 25 watt because it takes quite a time to charge the battery fully.N.B. I am not a gamer. I haven't done any gaming. You will need to go to YouTube for gaming reviews.\n", "\nThe WORST phone you can get in this range, front camera pics quality is so worst that it looks like an oil paint job with all smudged, NO SHARPNESS at all. The curve of display is so round it doesn't even  feel like a rounded rectangle, it's an OVAL. EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCTNow with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.\n", "\nGood phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good.

As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.\n', "\nWonderful phone for this budget.

It will easily last for 2 days if not more.

Earphone slot is given at a downside which makes it difficult to handle the phone.\n', '\nIt\'s been only a few days of purchase.  So far the experience is good. My usage is minimal for basic emails, social media chats, picture sharing etc. Very less usage for voice/video calls as well. No gaming. Battery seems to last three days easily on one full charge.What makes me proud to own this device is that in all the years I have owned a cell phone, this is the first time I am holding a "Made in India" device. Proud of that . Will post an update later based on future experience\n', '\nI have noticed below issues with phone.* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.Also battery drains out easily* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.\n', "\nCamera(VIDEO STABILIZATION dosent work) , battery are good .

Fingerprint sensor is awsome , it works very Smoothly .The software has better options .Mirror link is not supported by this mobile . If they had provided Mirror screen option then it would have been great ,no 3rd party app supports mirror link .Charging cable is too short .Camera is not as good as Nokia 8.1 ,6 .If the mobile gets IPS LCD SCREEN , SONY IMX CAMERA then the mobile would be so awesome\n", '\nPhones battery life is good but it gets heated for example when you are on call for a long time for while booking cabs when location is on it takes a lot of battery No pop up notifications in WhatsApp phone needs work in accessibility I am a low vision person the phones keyboard gets too much expanded when using zoom gesture making it impossible to type I have to reboot the whole phone to get the keyboard to its normal size after my purchase there was a software update due to which my screen gets zoom automatically creating problem while using which is very irritating face recognition is not that good phone takes two and a half hour to charge completely\n', '\nAmazing phone..Knock knock knock Sabka baap aaya... ♥️♥️🇮🇳🇮🇳\n', "\nI am a tech guy and this review is genuine. First of all Samsung is the baap of mobiles..coming to m31 I waited so long to buy and saw many reviews.lets start from positive..1. Camera is awesome both front and back. Picture clarity in zoom is good2. Very smooth finish of mobile which looks really great3. Touch is better than other mobiles compared to Oppo or MIComing to negative pointsall reviews almost fake regarding battery...they just really bluffed..6000 mah battery is not even coming for 2 full days..I used data for around 18 hrs but still it got drained fast.When charged the mobile it taking around 4 hrs to get complete charge from 0 to 100 percentage  but mobile is getting heated a lot..didn't expect this from Samsung at all.Loud speaker is not so efficient.Normal sound is goodAs its SAMOLED the picture or video quality is good..eyes r not strained\n", '\nI purchased this mobile based on previous Samsung galaxy mobile experience. Now i\'ve mixed feelings on it.These are my observations after single day use.1. Rear camera quality is extraordinary unless you zoom it.2. Front camera isn\'t that great. Beauty mode is always on and photos are patchy.3. Samsung KNOX isn\'t preinstalled. So, you can\'t use "Secure Folder". Need to install "S Secure" app for app lock.4. Guesture screenshot didn\'t work.5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.6. OS is so smooth.7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.Update: after multiple days of regular use1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,2. Though it\'s of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement4. Call quality isn\'t that great5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.Verdict: Go with this mobile if you\'re expecting a good rear camera and better battery performance.\n', '\nThis phone is great with battery backup and picture quality but within 8 days the phone got in bootloop as sson as I got a new update and I did it. This is not even starting now.\n', '\nIts OS Software got crashed in first update build release and it happened to all the M31 devices\n', "\nIt's nice but some camera quality should be improve.

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after a few days of usage and Again I re-order from this same model same colour and same configuration. price range very attractive and all requirement full fill. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide-angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. I may not require to carry my DSLR everywhere.Delivery was fast, packing was good,I share my experience with my friend they also buy this same product and also happy.Good:- Wi-Fi Calling Facility is to good.- The display is excellent with Blue light filter.- The performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery (More than 1.5 Days running with Internet)- 512 GB Memory card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is goodBuild Quality:This phone is fully made of plastic but the build quality is good.

The major problem is it's hanging. I am using this phone for last 45 days and it hangs 3 to 4 times and it takes 5 to 10 minutes and some times more to start working after hanging.i have Faith on Samsung but this hanging problem annoying me badly.Samsung needs to improve this issues.All other things are good.\n", "\nI have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks and the battery feels like 3000mAh at best.I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints hereCamera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality\n", "\nIt's really good device. Battery is a freaking beast, amoled display is beautiful and UI is very slick and simple. I got nothing to complaint considering what I paid for it.

It should not happen if its 64MP and one of its USP2) Speaker volume is very Low3) Can not split display while you are already on another app4) Can not connect internet through WPS5) Poor in facelock sensor6) Palm swipe to capture screen shot is not working always.. It should be 100% accurate then only it works..Rest all superb with this price\n', "\nThe product was a previously used one. This is shocking,  I've bought iPhone, iPads,  Macbook and HP laptops plus others thousands from Amazon and didn't expect this. Really disappointing.\n", "\nVery good product. I read about the concerns on the camera but still decided to go ahead. The mobile is fantastic. Camera, OS everything is good. This was my first online purchase of this value and had concerns there. But was delighted as everything went smooth. There was a delivery OTP provided by Amazon hence the delivery person had to deliver to me in person which was good. I was worried that he shouldn't leave it with security in my absence. 2nd, the seller had packed it nicely, the primary pack seal by the manufacturer was intact hence a genuine new pack. Overall, had a great experience - product, delivery and the  seller.\n", '\nI bought the mobile in the first day of its release and writing this review after almost 3 months.For a normal user without gaming and all..,Pros:1.  Good battery backup2.  Good display and hence we can watch movies and series also in this.Cons:1. Very dangeruos to use without screen guard or case. Display got broke on the second day and when I went to Samsung service centre.., they said the charge for changing display is Rs. 5500. which is very costly.2.  Cant use it in one hand and the sensitivity is so high that even before pressing BACK button.., when typing something automatically that gets executed and it goes to a different screen. We get irritated all the time that happens3. Face unlock is not up to the mark.In a sentence, I am not a satisfied customer because of the above issues.\n', '\nInitial reviewPerformance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.After one week of usageif the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.\n', "\nFirst time I plugged in for charging. Phone displayed recovery mode screen though I haven't pressed any button. Totally disappointed by this experience.I have requested to return this item and refund me entire amount but amazon policy relaxed upto replacement.Bad experience.Display and look wise phone looks stunning but still I haven't used it so system performance might be well as expected. I hope so.Waiting for brand new replacement of M31. I hope it would work well\n", '\nAfter using the phone for 3 months, i am writing this review.Pros:- Battery backup- Dual 4G Dual WiFi calling- High Quality LED Display- Camera in HDR mode- Sleek design- SpeedCons:- initially had restarting issues, later resolved after software update- Heats up on long video calls and battery drains fast due to high quality video- Camera could have been better, zooms in digital mode, not optical- Security lock function for each app not availableOverall an excellent phone at this price range with an excellent battery backup. You cannot expect a DSLR clarity for this price even if you have a 128 pixel in Digital zoom.If you are willing to buy only for a high quality camera, not a good choice. I have attached some shots, you can have a look and decide. Otherwise i am happy with my purchase 6 GB RAM & 128 GB Storage with a pretty good speed of operations.Mangal S\n', "\nPhone is ok.Battery is good enough, this is the only plus point.Face detection does not work very poor,OTG is very good, Doc. Files transferred open directly without going through any app.Keyboard features not good in comparison to Google.Camera quality is very bad, white light turns blue, good pictures turn out very deep coloured.Palm screen shot does not work so the time.Adaptive screen doesn't work.Phone is slow.Power on off is missing.Plastic back cover gets scratched very fast.Videos plays in 2 steps, one in off volume.Samsung phones are not good for gear S2 watches, it connects through Samsung galaxy store which which does not show all the faces as In other phones & it also does not show the purchased watch faces.There is a feature of Zip apps, which is of no use bcoz if you zip an app you can't use it, so what's the purpose of zipping? And after unzipping apps get lost.Photo editor is not good enough,,,\n", "\nIts been 10 days since i have started using the phone. There are certain things i'd like to mention.Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy. We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.\n", "\nI have a Samsung M31SYMPTOMSa) all videos regardless of the application used are playing on fastforward with no sound. This happens on all apps incl youtube, netflix, amazon prime, including videos I have been sent via WhatsApp. b) there is no sound on the phone at all - nothing when I play music, it doesn't ring when someone calls me, and even though i can pick up the call, I can't hear the other person's voice and they cant hear mine ATTEMPTED FIXES THAT DID NOT WORK1. Restart multiple times2. Reset app preferences3. Play with Dolby settings (restore to default, turn off/on)4. Wipe cache preferences using volume up/down buttons then rebooting5. Adjusting all the volume settings to make sure nothing was muted6. Turn phone on on safe mode to ensure it wasnt the apps that were buggy (and played a video I had stored on my phone but same issue)\n", '\nSamsung Galaxy M31 gives you a very high value for the price. Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.At this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example -  AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone\n', '\nBattery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.\n', "\nWriting this review after two weeks of usage. The phone has some weight to it, which is something I was looking for and it really feels good to hold in hand just like the old rugged Motorola's.Display and the battery capacity are something which impressed me a alot and I can definitely vouch for it. Camera is also cool, but not that great, but it is good enough for the price you pay.The only thing I am little disappointed was it has some lag while browsing and if it is improved, the phone really rocks for the price.Overall when compared to chinese phones in the market, Samsung is really doing good in terms of service, trust and the value of the product.Also, would like to thank Amazon for fast delivery and awsome service.\n", "\nI thoroughly like this mobile.Very smooth to handle.The camera is very good in day light and medium to low light.The battery back up is awesome.

MUST-READ.Samsung has literally poured premium qualities in this phone.1)CAMERA - Quad Camera rich quality photos. Even after Zoom, details are very clear & No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear & stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent & reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality & long-lasting capacity).3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick & so far no single glitch.4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass. (also depends upon on the quality of your headphones like How much it supports to this technology)5)CALL QUALITY- Premium mic quality. Crisp & Clear voice calls. Supports almost all CODECS including Aptx6) RAM - Best RAM management, even after you play heavy graphics games along with complex tasks, you'll see approx 1.5gb still left. That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience & to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance & during multitasking & Gameplay.8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings. Recommending to use Built-in Game Booster feature for Thriving Gaming experience along with AMOLED graphics. Just Imagine.9)BATTERY - 6000mAh juice will give you an output of approx 2 Days on avg use & 1 day(20hrs) on heavy usage.SUMMARY -  If you looking for a maintenance-free consistent device for 3-4 years then Go for It without hegitation.\n", '\nThe best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a disappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.A little more details after a couple of months usage. This phone needs to be little more rugged as it can crack at edges and screen very easily. An aluminum/any metal body would be much better. The battery after 2hrs 20 mins charge can easily take you through the day with above moderate usage. For heavy users, still a fast charging option may be required at the end of day. I mean who keeps phone to charge for 2+ hours? You cannot risk charge it whole night too. Samsung has produced a nice phone. It could be a game changer with some more changes.\n', "\nI have been using M31 from last 3 months here are some pros and cons...Cons•Fingerprint sensor Dose not recognise sometimes, i tried to setup it again but had same issue. But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.• The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.•The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.• Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I’m noticing less lag. Just don’t get this phone for gaming the chipset isn’t good enough.Pros•Samsung is known for their Super AmoledScreen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.•On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn’t good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it’s average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.•LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.•This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you’re heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.So overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using  social media...If you’re heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn’t for you. So if you don’t play graphics demanding games on your phone you will like this phone....\n", '\nAfter using the Samsung Galaxy M31 with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage for more than 2 months, I list following pros and cons:A. Pros1. Very good display quality. Watching videos is a delightful experience2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast4. Apps load quickly as expecteB. Cons1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of "fast charging", which is very disappointing.Overall the phone is very good and highly recommended.\n', "\nTotally flop phone,worst experience of my life to buy this mobile.After 15 days of purchase camera fail,always hanging problem.Now service center tell mother board and camera of this phone require to change.I feel cheated,I don't no whom to blame-AMAZON/SELLER/SAMSUNG.But my suggestion is never brought this M31.After spending a huge amount now I am running towards SERVICE CENTRE and there is a huge waiting during this pandemic and as usual server problems.Now today my phone is submitted and may be in 3-5days its problem solved.\n", "\nWorst phone ever I bought. I ordered the phone in 1st day of lunch. I got timely delivery but  After using for 29 days phone got hang up while updating software. Now phone is locked for more than 2days in a screen showing AVB error . I tried to restart phone many time but still showing same . Even I let the phone to get switch off by itself after consumption of battery still showing same while charging.Now I can't return it because they say return period were till 27th march. Lockdown nation wide still on can't go to Samsung care centre. I'm giving those stars because I don't have any option for zero.I don't understand what should I do.\n", "\nPhone is good. Value for money, but sound quality is not good. While playing Facebook,Youtube and other MX Player or internal video's it's not getting sound. If I restart then phone then its sounding. I'm facing oftenly but it's not resolved yet. And Wifi hotspot is not working properly while connecting to desktop or Laptop. But its connecting to mobiles. I raised for exchange phone, let's see what will happen. But I never expects this type of problems by SAMSUNG. Really upset....!!\n", '\nBest features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don\'t need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can\'t use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and "reduce animations" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox securityDisplay: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experienceSound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that\'s what Bluetooth speakers are for)Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that\'s not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can\'t sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table\n', '\nI will say excellent phone overall. Amazing camera quality and battery life. Phone speed is perfect and screen touch and navigation  is awesome. Over all for people who have issues with Samsung this phone, i do not agree as i am experiencing  best mobile phone. Camera quality is perfect and features  are so easily accessible. Under 20 k if someone is looking for  perfect and durable mo ile phone, then bilndedly go for this without hesitation.

After having extensively used Samsung m31 for two days I am in love with the software as well as its hardware. There's tonnes of features in this OS optimised by Samsung. There's redmi note 8 users in my house and I can tell you that those phones are absolute Sh!t in front of m31. This phone may not come with features like punch hole display, in screen fingerprint sensor but after having used this I don't miss those features. I hate notches on phones but the one on this is great and doesn't disturb the functionality of display. Great phone to buy overall. And bonus : this is not a Chinese spy phone.\n", "\nPositives:Great battery lifeNice screen, thank you amoledConvenient features, fast connectivity (Bluetooth, wifi)Has not frozen once. No software issues yetNegatives:Face recognition and finger print recognition are iffy.Front facing camera is not sharp at all. Looks like my 2008 computer built in webcamSamsung apps that can't be removed. (Why add bloatware that no one uses anyways?)Plastic body while Redmi has metal bodies at the same price pointStill, a great phone at this price. I keep hearing rumors about how Samsung phones slow down after a few years, I'll see if that's the case and update this review accordingly.

Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ✌️ continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs\n", "\nI bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.

Plz no bay this mobile\n", '\nChanging my review after 3 months of usage. It is not getting on!!!!! Not working within 3 months????!!!

Front camera is worse camera but with update it get little better. we can't turn on flast while wide angle photo It is not even week since I bought , suddenly screen touch stop working , can't restart or do anything on it . Lying useless at moment . Shame on you Samsung .\n", "\nPhone is very slow because of the custom OS of Samsung, press lock button and it takes half a second to lock the screen, gets hanged too, not worth the price. Battery takes long to charge. Compared to other smartphone in the same price range, it's not worth buying unless you want phone with long battery life and the brand name.\n", "\nInitially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.Pros:1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.Cons:1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.\n", '\nIts almost 3 months now. Giving review about this phone:PROS:1) Made In India, in Noida factory.2) Very good touch screen. You don\'t require screen guard, as its scratch resistant/scratch free.3) Superb battery life.4) Doesn\'t get heated after prolonged use.CONS:1) It doesn\'t have block number feature with prefix pattern. You have to add individual numbers. E.g. you know call starting with 140 are all advertisement calls. You can\'t ignore them simply by adding 140*, you have to individually add. Trucaller has this feature, but you require to install this 3rd party APP.2) SAMSUNG claims its a 15W charger. But if you know Wattage is Volt X Current. Its 5V, 2A charger, that is 10W. In short its weaker charger than what company claims.3) Its touch screen is very sensitive. If soap water etc gets on to the screen then even after cleaning by cloth, screen doesn\'t respond for long time. "Accidental touch feature" if you put ON then especially you get into this issue.Overall:Overall for this range with brand like SAMSUNG, its definately a good BUY. Much better than Chinese phones.\n', "\nVery bad phone, heating issue, battery  changing  takes 5 hour to charge fully, contacted technical  support team, they said reset the phone, after reset same problem is there, I want my money back, very bad experiencewith Amazon  , they're fooling by saying blancco diagnostics to install the app in there phone\n", "\nTo be frank!! I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung  must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery  The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI  Apart this the mobile is good one who are not students if you are a student to buy this you are must be a normal users not heavy users\n", "\nAmoled display very Sharp and vivid.Battery life excellent ...hardly 30 to 40 percent battery down if you are moderate user and not playing continuous game.OS is smooth.CAMERA need to improve , need to check software upgrades but it's not too bad ,only we need to search for better software.Finger print reader is fast.Go for 6 GB and 128 GB option so no need to worry about space issue.9611 samsung equinox processor works well no lagging observed ( i am also using 1st time this processor ...otherwise I prefer SD processor).Charging require 3 hours to full charge..it is just 15 watts charger but dont worry battery performance is great so hardly need to charge.Samsung really pack monster under 20k ( Best price offered.)Best phone offered by Samsung....go for it👌\n", "\nOverall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.\n", '\nI will not recommend this product to anyone due to the following facts:1. Exynos 9611, which is a 10 nm processor, produces so much lagg.2. 6000 mah battery is just a gimmick. It is also not comparable with even 4000 mah battery of other brands. It does not even last for a single day with moderate usage i.e. surfing with wifi connectivity (no gaming or watching videos).3. 64 mega pixel camera is another gimmick. No detailing is there. Capture is very much grainy. Pixel is also visible.4. Build quality is just not bearable. It gives feel similar to 7-8k phone. Cheap plastic is used in the back.5. Charging time is horrible. Near about 2.5 hours for full charge. It gives feel of black and white time!!I tried several times to contact Amazon technical team but they are not responding. Hopeless!!\n', "\nI purchased this phone for my dad. But i used it for 4-5 days. And on that basis i can say that:• The performance of the phone is very smooth. I don't find any hanging problem.• The battery life of this phone is amazing. If you are using your phone without internet then the battery life works for 3-5 days.• The camera quality of the rear is nice but front cam is not up to that point. It's like you are using front cam with an beauty editor.• As you all know about the screen, it's just awesome.• And other functions of the phone starts properly.Before purchasing this phone. I compared it to many of the smartphones. And trust me this tops at first in this range.

Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.\n", "\nPurchsed one on launch. Had almost made up my mind to buy M30s but saw notification of this M31 being launched so kept my purchase on hold. The features were good at the price. The wait was worthy.

This is sufficient for a day if one is in hurry to leave for work. By the time one gets ready the phone can be charged 50% almost.Full charge takes about 2.30 hrs. Samsung should have provided a 15 V charger in box as they provide to all the YouTube reviewers. All reviewers spoke of inbox 15W charger.I would have given 5 star rating in all categories then.The finger print scanner occasionally fails to unlock with finger print. Have to press the lock button and unlock again with the finger then. Don't know the reason why this happens.Though I am not a selfie lover or one who keeps on clicking photos often, I found the camera quality good enough, both front and back.Sound quality is ok. Though feel the speaker could have been bit louder.No doubts about Samsung amoled display, it's the best. Samsung being pioneer in this.

SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT  CAMERA  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.3. 6000mah BATTERY  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.Cons--1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX  SECURITY  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.3. BUILD QUALITY  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.4. 15 WATT CHARGER  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.Note-1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.\n", '\nPathetic product delivered, phone set delivered on 16th March & i have gifted it on 23rd March, when the phone is switched on, phone touch not working, keypad not working, so many time requested for replacement, Amazon least bothered to acknowledge it, nor I have got confirmation for replacement, when we call customer care they say lock down, understand , my question is why amazon not accepting requests for replacement, I have requested for replacement( on 23r March 2020 )  before return window closed ( I e on 26th March 2020)\n', "\nBefore zeroing in on the Samsung Galaxy M31, I researched the smartphone market in India and tabulated the data in terms of specs.

Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k.

I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.I want to explain it's some feature as below1stly Battery 5star2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.3rd Front camera - 4star.4th Processor - 4star5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4starThese all ratings are out of 5.Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone..

This is way more friendly and easier to use.GPU:A very strong processor is provided by Samsung in this phone. None of the games lag and works perfectly fine.\n", "\nI purchased a Black 6/64 varient on 4th May and in 3 weeks I can confirm that I regret purchasing an iphone 7plus worth 62 thousand that too 3 years ago.I am not a user who will zoom a picture and compare the pixals, honestly, is that needed? You dont really zoom pictures more than your phone's size so why make the hype.About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use.Somewhere I also feel that this phone provides me more features than ios 13. I don't really miss charging my iphone twice a day lol\n", "\nSo, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.9. Headphone is not given with phone.\n", "\nExcellent product. Worth buying it.Pros:Massive 6k battery. Goes on and on.4 rear cameras with the main one at 64mp.Excellent front cam.Blue color looks stunning.S amoled screen with always on display.Finger print and face unlock work superb.Android 10.Cons:Limited bloatware, Samsung apps, which can be disabled at least which is good.Back panel absorbs fingerprints easily. Needs frequent cleaning.Doesn't come with an earphone. You can buy one outside per your choice.Suggestions:Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.Never look at M30 or M30s. You get M31 for the same price with much better camera.\n", "\nA complete mega Monster.  This phone brings back Samsung in competition with the Chinese brands which has captured the market share in recent years.Before writing this review, let me tell you'll a short brief on my requirements and background. I'm middleaged,  working professional from Mumbai and my requirements were basic usage with some multimedia at the EOD. And I'm not a gamer. This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this,  I've been using A popular known brand and model,  Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming.  And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...\n", "\nafter 6 days of use:Camera 5/5Performance 5/5Display 5/5Battery 5/5Phone look 5/5User interface 5/5Sound 5/5awesome phonePros:1.

Those gyz who says in you tube that it works 1 and half day or two days ..that does not perfectly match with the reality.One more think charging time is very high u need 3 hrs to recharge it from zero to 100%.

Charging time is approx 140 minutes.Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up.

A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smoothBattery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expectScreen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decentCamera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp camProcessor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme.

Thanks to the lockdown, had lots of time on my hand to review most phones, get firsthand accounts from friends and then make a choice.To be honest, my first preference was the OP8 and was looking for video reviews when I stumbled upon this phone. Samsung seems to have packaged a decent bit of hardware and specifications on this phone which gets most of your job done.Disclaimer: If you are an avid gamer, then this is not for you unless you are ready to make trade offsWhat I Like the most:1. Comes with Android one UI v2. The phone has a near bloat free experience and very close to stock android. However, some of the features are masked by Samsung, I'm if those will be available in higher end or flagship models like S20 / S20 Note etc. However, loving the features like Dark mode, use Camera flash for notification, ability to capture more than one face etc.2. Amazing display, the AmOLED display is a pleasure to view and even can be used under direct sunlight.3. The phone comes with support for two sims and SD card, which is good for avid music lovers like me to stash and carry my ever-growing collection of music & videos.4. Samsung switch App, for once I have a product from Samsung which does the job without any fuzz. Was able to transfer my data from my broken phone using this.5. The Camera is of decent quality, so far, the pictures have turned out well, but still exploring so will reserve my comments for now.What I don’t like1. 6000 MAH battery adds to the weight but gives the same performance as my old phone 4000 MAH battery. Could have tweaked battery usage2. The build is dated, and the naked phone may not draw any oohs & aahs from onlookers. Plastic body is prone to scratches and fingerprints, so better invest in a case.3. No headphones provided by Samsung, not sure if this is the trend, but a simple 100 Rs earphone could have enhanced the VFM perspective.4. Lastly the Exynos processor, so far, I’ve not notices any lag or slowness, but at times I feel that the phone is a tad unresponsive especially when I try to pull down the notification panel or try to dismiss a few apps.Overall Verdict:It’s a bargain buy with good specifications, recommend purchasing this.\n", '\n\xa0Worst product.Camera performance is below average.I received a defective product and when asked for replacement, they performed a smartcheck and said everything is fine.Whenever I make a video call the other person is not able to hear properly.I have checked by putting the same sim card on a different mobile and used the same app to video call(WhatsApp) which was fine. When I complained on the video quality, I was told to use super steady mode.I have attached a video  shooted in super steady in the same mobile which was like the old video cassette we use to watch during 90s.Do check that before you invest your money in this smartphone.\n', "\nI bought this as my b'day gift & also b'coz of my bro.

It does take a bit of time to get fully charged. But once that's done, it'll easily last for more than a day.4. The earphone slot is at the bottom of the phone. I personally like it on the top.

Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.Pros-1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.Average features-1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.Cons-1. No cover provided within the box.2. No headphones provided.3. No Samsung secure folder.4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. 👍\n", "\nCamera quality is 3rd class.64MP is like 06MP & 32MP is like 03MP.Pixel quality of photo is very bad.6K monster battery is myth.

Screen - The Display is superb to say the least. sAMOLED display makes watching videos a delight!2. Camera - Few modes and video shooting in both rear and front camera is great. The enhancements dont make the photos look artificial which is great! However, can improve on the 64 MP mode - probably on OTA update can fix it.3. Battery - I have used phones with 5000 mAH battery for the last 2-3 years from Asus (Max series) - If I would rank that 5/5 because they would easily last 1.5 days without charge, this would be 4 +0.5 /5 ( 0.5 for fast charging, even if battery drains out fast). A full charge can last the day.  This is when I have medium to heavy usage of phone without gaming.4. Processing - Very smooth for 6GB, no lags whatsover!5. Some modes and features -•Dolby Atmos Sound mode for headsets is amazing!• Game mode has lots of features related to screen like screen recording, etc.• Fingerprint scanner is super fast too. Haven't tried the face unlock so can't comment on that.Overall, would suggest that if you want to couple the brand trust along with good features - definitely go for M31 !\n", '\nMonster phone!

Touch screen is very sensitive and I loved it while typing.4. Automatic light mode, which is very  good option and it as acting as per need based on our adjustments on timely basis.5. Optins wise also it has many features that we can enable  for the smart usage.6. Quality of sound is awesome.... feel like we are in theater. Have DolbyAtmos option to change the sound effect.

It\'s like you have your work related each and every thing in your pocket.• Experience of viewing videos at night in an amOLED screen is blissfull.\n', "\nI have been loyal Samsung user for years now. This one works smooth but trying to get used to its screen length. Camera works fine. I haven't noticed any difference between normal cam mode and 64mp mode, but both are fine. Macro lens version is to be simply admired. Slow motion works well too. Overall it's a good phone. I am satisfied.\n", '\nBattery life and RAM performance is very good, but the USP - 64MP main camera and other 3 cameras do not perform to the specifications. No portrait mode so no 3D photos on FB. Even the 64MP main camera fails to capture details and objects blur on zooming in - not at all expected. Macro camera does some good work, but not able to capture details required for a macro photo. Wide angle camera and live focus are just good enough. Night mode is not so impressive.

Its extremely well balanced and easy to hold and navigate with one hand.

The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.7. Price.Cons:1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protection🙂.\n", "\nI have been using this device for more than 2 weeks. I am an above-average user the battery lasts around 40 hrs plus. I am happy with the device.1. About the OLED screen: I can adjust the color saturation, I have reduced the color saturation as I am not that used to vivid OLED displays. Brightness is pretty decent one good feature is that we can reduce the brightness to a lower level such that I don't want to install any 'Dark mode' application for night use.2. Camera: Camera is pretty good, the wide-angle view is pretty handy when we don't have much space in the room. The front camera is also pretty decent on low light(Recommended).3. Weight: It is pretty heavy as it has a massive 6000mah battery. However, the weight is balanced so it is nice to hold on, we won't feel it too heavy when we hold it for a long time.4. Performance: Performance is a said as in the paper, I have tried Call of Duty and worked in medium graphics well.5.Bluetooth: Bluetooth is important for me as I usually take calls with my Voyager Wireless headphones. Connection time is extremely low . I could turn on my headphone while phone is ringing and the next second the headphone is connected. I used to wait/need to manually connect on my old Zenfone max. So this is a great value add for meNB: This is not a dedicated gaming phone.To conclude with this is a very good phone for people who travel a lot and watch movies , surf internet, attend online meetings during their travel. This is not the phone for gamers\n", "\nLet me expand on first impression; the packaging was good, sturdy and sanitized — which is great. Smarphone came with all the accessories written on the box.There was no charge in the unit—odd I remembered samsung delivering fifty percent charge in there products, either way I did boot it up after leaving it for charge for around three hours — fast, responsive display, beautiful camera. And you can set settings of the display to natural colour.Software: As far as the Samsung's own UI is concern, I think it's intuitive, lacks some crazy fastness of AOSP or android one projects — but with the phone one is paying for the software as well. And might as well, use these OEMs rather than running something plain. It's stable so far and running great. Fingerprint is pretty fast, as fast as my other device poco F1Battery line is absolutely wonderful, it takes almost 3 hours I think to be fully charged, with standard usage it gives me screentime of around 36 hours sometimes 24, while playing PUBG or Call of duty.Camera quality: Well, I only have one word, impressive. Camera on this phone is social butterfly's or some serious smartphone photography, videography — although no video stabilisation in 4k mode.Some things to look out for: Phone body catches smudges easily, so get a cover if you are serious about it.\n", '\nGood phone for the price. Screen quality and performance are good.Cons: Speaker not so great. Low lighting camera not so great.1 star less for delivery.Fingerprint and face unlock is good. Camera in outdoors gives great pics.\n', "\nThe fone is awesome overall. I just hv one problem. The screen I view before clicking a picture and the one that is captured are missin 4 inches.. is this a fault?

But please look into this.\n", "\nFirst of all, this is a china-free smartphone. Samsung produces no smartphone in above mentioned country.This piece is a value for money product. I am experiencing a monstrous battery life with decent super amoled display.You will definitively observe a mind boggling viewing experience.Blue light effect is quite helpful for eyes. And its outstanding camera quality will impress you to the brim.Last but not least, Brand Value, Samsung always has a reasonable resale value.Cons:Speaker output is low. If you are a type of person who doesn't like earphones, and loves to hear songs on speaker, this product might not impress you.Exynos 9611, though is a decent processor equivalent to Snapdragon 712, but is unsuitable for hardcore gamers. In low graphics, you can observe playable fps.Charging time is approximately 180-190 minutes from 0-100. Fast charging needs improvement.Samsung could have provided an earphone, unfortunately, there's none.Summary:This is a value for money smartphone which focus is to grab attention of movies and TV show audience.

The battery life is surprisingly not good. It takes a long time to charge since its 6000 mah battery but drains completely in a day. The face unlock is not that fast. The camera is noisy at night and the wide angle sides gets distorted. Even the front camera is not that good at low light. Also absolutely hate that Samsung has so many pre installed app which cluster the phone and is of absolute no use.Overall an okay phone, for me i expected better at 17k.\n', '\nNice phone with almost all advanced features.Pros:-1.

I'm happy with its performance in general, so far.Few things which I feel require a quick mention:1. Battery - Although the phone has a fast charging capability, my device takes roughly between 1.5 to 2.5 hours to completely charge, which is a bit disappointing, but the battery lasts easily for 24 hours so that's okay. Still disappointed about the slow charging bit.2. Camera - The primary camera performs best in an outdoor lighting condition with a fairly decent color reproduction. The EIS for 1080p videos is good. The front-faced camera captures good pictures and records video decently in indoor lighting conditions. Didn't get to check it in an outdoor condition.3. Other features - The build quality looks premium. The volume and the power buttons appears to be of good quality. The finger print sensor has a quick response time which is great. The touchscreen quality is indeed good. The OS operates well, I haven't noticed any lag so far. The dark mode is a welcome addition to this phone. Call quality is very good. The speakers are fairly loud given there's only 1 speaker grill at the bottom.Overall, in my opinion M31 is a value for money phone from Samsung.\n", "\nAfter so much of research, I decided to go with M31 on the second day of launch. To my surprise, the phone matched my Expectations. Have to appreciate Amazon for the super fast delivery, I ordered it by night around 10pm and I got the phone delivered by next day morning 9am. Packing was good and safe.I'm writing this mobile review based on my first 2 days experience with this phone. Will add later if there is anything.Pros:1. Very nice battery. It was coming roughly 2 days for a moderate usage in 4G.2. Camera is very decent. Even though it doesn't justify 64mp, still I would say camera is good with clear pictures.3. Display is too good4. Phone is not very heavy and good to use5. Voice clarity and signal is good6. Looks very good and stylish too.Cons:1. Finger print is placed very high in the back, needs to stretch a bit to reach the sensor2. Charging is very slow(I understand its 6000mah), roughly 2.5hrs, could have given charger with more watts.3. Charging cable length is very short4. No earphones provided with this mobile.5. Speaker is not much loud as only one speaker is provided at the bottom6. Has mild heat when we play high end games, but its not too heat alsoOverall is a Good budget phone to buy.\n", '\nNothing much to say about disliking,Because I love this phone,Camera quality is best,Battery life was my preferred thing to look for and so now I dont have to worry about it after buying this phone.Finger print reader is working best, as previously I used some other phones whose finger print reader did suck after using for a month, but Samsung so far has done a wonderful quality built.I am happy and I know it.\n', "\nBought the m31 (6+128) both space black and ocean blue variants for me and my brother.here are my views about the device.Pros:1.Super amoled display which is more vibrant than IPS LCD pannels2.Stunning blacks Thanks to the Samsung's SAMOLED DISPLAY.3.Massive 6000 mah battery which lasts for around  1 and half to 2 based on our usage.4.super user friendly thanks to samsung ONEUI 2.0 the interface is too Good.5.come with android 10 out of the box.6.The quad camera setup is decent enough and there is some auto focus issue which I think may be corrected with an update.7.Decent performer for games like pubg,call of duty etc....8.Always on display is very useful and get done the task of notification LED ofcourse there is some battery drain because of this feature.But trust me it is very less than you expected.Cons:1.supports 15W fast charging only which make the total charge time to around 2h 30 mins .but remember the capacity is around 6000mah which take more time to charge.2.Design is too old as we are getting glass finish in other brands within this budget range.3.Need improvement in the speed of unlocking phone using biometrics.\n", '\nFantastic phone in this price range. Overall its a very good smartphone. The sAMOLED screen is very sharp and clear. Fingerprint sensor is very fast.

I am no techie to review the phone on its technical aspects but as a common layman I truly love its performance since the 3 days I have been using it.The set up  took really less time than I expected and it comes with Smart Switch App, which made the data transfer easy and smooth.The pictures clicked from the phone are extremely good and nice, however I saw a flicker of light when I tried to take a slowmotion video. I am not sure if the flickering was because of the light or the issue was with the camera. but there was not such flickering while capturing a slowmotion video in daylight.The battery back up seems to be amazing, Since 3 days I have charged it only once. (Other than the charging done on the first day for 3 hours). But the charging is not as fast, and I feel the 15V charger is not good enough for the 6000 MaH BatteryOverall I loved the phone it is smooth, fast and Vibrant.... and Im loving it\n', "\nThe phone is good so far and I have played games like PUBG and Asphalt 9 for around 1 hr approximately. The phone heats up a bit. Not sure about the heavy gamers as I haven't tried playing for longer duration. Apart from it, no issues with the phone. Happy with the purchase. The front camera and the rear camera are just good and there is no lag in the processing of the photo. There are really good apps preinstalled and customization options in UI. I felt the volume of the speaker is a bit low, however it is just okay. I recommend if you want a nice music playing device, go for a nice speaker to use. It's a good durable phone. Not sure about the heavy gamers as I haven't triend pl\n", '\nVery good handset in the budget of 17k that to from a brand like Samsung. i was using Galaxy A7 before to this mobile and other than thickness and few features like on-screen notifications and PIP features are missing. But Battery performance wise \\ camera & Display wise makes this mobile on upper hand side.for thoose who are camera lovers and brand freakers can choose this mobile without any worries.\n', '\nRiding high on Anti-Sino wave, a lot of my friends purchased Samsung products over the Snappier snapdragon containing Redmi/realme phones. I gave into the "wisdom of the crowd" and got my mother one. Man, the story hasn\'t changed a bit for Galaxy phones in India. The Exynos used to be better than the SD till 810/815 - but the mid level snapdragon rangers (720/730g) are leagues above the Exynos 96xx.The performance of the phone is laggy. The battery despite being humongous 6000mAH, doesn\'t really last as long as you\'d expect in comparison to a 5020mAH of Redmi note 9 Pro/max. The fast charging in relative terms is really slow (2-2.5 hours 5% to 100%).The Camera is decent, the UI is good, the build quality is good. But what really disappoints you is the non-snappiness of the phone. If you compare the poco x2/RN9Pro max and M31 side by side - the phone feels like a low tier middle ranger or one running on a dated mediaTek processor! The overall experience - really hits the rockbottom when after a game, phone takes a 2-3 second pause to repopulate the screen icons.Samsung, please give the Indian market the choice to select between the two processors for your phones.\n', "\nThis is my 5th samsung phone and following are the pros and cons for this product.Pros:-Build quality:-2.5/5 yeah most of it is polycarbonate which feels little lighter on side but it is better than glass back for those who use phone roughly it eliminates the rust of breaking.Style:- 5/5 yeah it's samsung👍Performance:- 4/5 yeah it is a monster 👍Camera:-5/5 superb it is,👍Battery:-5/5 two days on the go👍Display:-5/5 i love samsung s-amoled👍👍Fingerprint sensor:- 5/5 lightining fastFace unlock:- 5/5 lightining fastCONS-polycarbonate looks like plastic.Processor is little dizzy for hardcore gamersPhysical Fingerprint sensor is a bit outdated now a days.Polycarbonate back is plain and fingerprint magnet.\n", '\nCamera quality is not so good , work like 48mp and after detailing photos quality is poor than 48mp of other mobile camera but selfie camera is goodOne ui features not given completely, secure folder option is not available and other options ( see videos on YouTube) , nice to use one ui other than any mobile  ..... , but need more features of one uiCharging time is 2hrs 50min , but battery life is goodProcessor is bad if u play games for long times other wise it is good for normal useNot useful for play  pubg if u play for long timesSamsung need to give at this price snapdragon 720 or 730As usual screen is the positive thing of this phone , super amoled , nice display ,nice to touch other than any phone at this price range , but in playing games nothing changes seen in touchSound quality is also good , Dolby atoms nice featureFinger print is also so good\n', "\nI had recieved ae defective piece...I recieved this phone on March 16th....keypad getting stuck  from the day one...I thought due to software not update yet..bcoz one update  I kept it hold...but after update also same issue...I'm very disappointedTechnician advised to hard reset  phone .After that also same issue...Now it's corona lockdown...Amazon won't exchange.. and won't respond....Even delivery was worse for me....Totally loss of money....Very very bad..About phone:Initially battery started charging fast...now its very slow...And people who habituated to redmi honor will get disappointed  with battery charge..Samsung is brand  ..agreed...but ppl who wants flexibility more...I don't recommend  this product....Even camera is also not excellent..its just okNow I want reply from Amazon regarding  defective piece.thank you\n", '\n\xa0Received my phone on 5th March 2020. Same day delivery provided by Amazon. I am using this phone for the last 3 months. I selected this phone for the battery backup 6000mAh and internal memory 128GB. I am happy as the phone performs well in these requirements. Please note that the network signal is not good at my office location and naturally phone would get discharge very fast. After full charge at 08:00 AM my phone battery capacity is showing at 47% at 11:00 PM at night. 64 mega pixel quad Camera at rear side. Picture quality is good. We can adjust the brightness while taking photos. Wide lens option for group photos is quite useful. Slow motion and super slow motion options are available. Fingerprint sensor is fast. On the box "made in India" label is printed and I feel proud. Arogyasetu app is running with bluetooth on 24X7. Ear phones are not part of package. Overall I am happy with my purchase.\n', '\nThe phone is good in the price band. The camera is decent, however zooming captures are pictulerated. The battery life is 6000mAh, and provides reasonable back up. However the charger could have been improved and provided a quicker charging speed.The display is by far the best in the range, easily beats the other phones like Mi.Not a gaming phone for sure, if your usage is mostly in watching movies and texting. You should go for this one.\n', '\nThis phone is best at its price, best in class display to enjoy your content, best in class battery that lasts for the whole day, a decent processor to keep you up for day to day usage and a decent camera. I deducted 1 star for its screen, my phone screen got broken within a month at first drop from my waist height. That was disappointing but I expected Samsung to make it better with its successor.\n', '\nBattery backup not very good. And i am facing frequent issues with network connectivity and also with sound.. I have to restart now and then to get it working again. Slight heating issue is also there. Overall, i am disappointed with the mobile. I dont know if these issues are in my handset only or is a model defect. Camera is just nice only and not great as i expected from a 64 mp camera. Screen display quality is good and touchscreen is very responsive though.\n', "\nWell. The phone is pretty  slick. With the first week of usage,  some of the things i have seen1. Fast charging is excellent. Battery charged from 0 to 100% in about 75-80 min. Lasts about 1.5-2 days2. Camera is good. I'm not a heavy user of cameras but found the captures are good quality. Obviously lots of features to explore3. Dobly  sounds makes a difference and is evident.so that's a plus.4. A lot of pre loaded apps. A good 3 GB gets consumed with regular apps like Netflix,  Amazon and stuff.5. Spend time on optimising apps in terms of battery usage  and permissions.6. I was previously  using a phone which had the fingerprint sensor in front.  Somehow find sensor behind a little cumbersomeOverall,  a good phone in the budget range\n", "\nTRENDINGBEST MOBILESUPCOMING PHONESTOP NEWSHome » Mobile » ReviewsSamsung Galaxy M31: The Good, The Bad, And The X FactorBy Sandeep SarkarUpdated: Friday, March 20, 2020, 16:56 [IST]Samsung has added a new handset in the Galaxy M series dubbed Galaxy M31. The company introduced this series last year to compete against its Chinese counterparts like Xiaomi and Realme who own a major chunk of the market with feature-rich smartphones being offered an affordable price tag.The latest entrant comes as a successor to the Galaxy M30s which has been quite popular in the mid-range segment. Carrying some traits from its predecessor, the Galaxy M31 is packed with a humongous 6,000 mAh battery and an L-shaped quad-camera module.At a starting price label of Rs. 14,999 for the 6GB RAM+64GB storage and Rs. 15,999 for the 6GB RAM+128GB storage model, it goes up against the likes of the Honor 9X, Redmi Note 8 Pro, and the Realme XT. Let's see what this device brings to the table and how good is it against the Chinese rivals in our initial impressions:Samsung Galaxy M31: The GoodHigh-Resolution Super AMOLED DisplayThe first thing that will grab your attention while buying this handset is its big high-resolution display. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with a 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display that churns out 1080 x 2340 pixels FHD+ resolution and has a tall 19:5:9 aspect ratio. Samsung has never compromised with the display quality; which seems evident on the Galaxy M31 as well.The tall display complemented by high-resolution support makes it suitable for 1080p videos. Moreover, the narrow bezels all around the display give you the maximum area to watch content. The U-shaped notch is slightly bigger.The colors delivered are punchy and vivid, something which you will find on other mid-range Samsung smartphones as well. The viewing angles and sunlight visibility seems good. But, we will be able to give feedback after a thorough usage. It is worth noting that this is the same display that the company had used on its predecessor, i.e, the Galaxy M30s. So, you can expect the same display output.\n", "\nBelieve me guys this is the best overall package u can get under 18k i have just brought a 64gb variant from amazon at 16k and trust me guys it exceeded my expectationsFirstly lets talk about the cons or negative points of the phone1. The polycarbonate back is a fingerprint magnet and is quite slippery applying a cover is  Highly reccomended2. The glass on the front is highly fragile and gets easily cracked. So applying a tampered glass is necessary.3. The front camera performs very poor in low light4. The fast charging is enabled by default but the battery backup is around 9hrs but if i disable fast charging i could get around 12 hrs of screen on time again that is a good thing because u can just charge it at night as it takes around 4 and half hours to charge completelyNow lets talk about pros:1. Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is  way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devicesIn the competition3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.If u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition\n", "\nTheis phone completely suits to all my needs. I have been using realme 3 pro for the last 1 year. The phone was quite good, but the samsung m31 beats it in almost every category. This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.The phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.It has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.The only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.In the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades. But for now I'm 99 percent satisfied with this phone( aside from that palm swipe screenshot). This is a must buy phone.\n", '\nThe reason I went for the M31 was because most reviews I adjudged it as "bang for the buck", and because Samsung is a trusted brand. I was familiar with the M series as my mother owns an M30s and after a week of using this phone, I am glad I made the decision to buy it.Firstly, the most amazing thing about the M31 is the battery life. The battery comfortably lasts for more than 30 hours with moderately heavy use. The 15W charger keeps charging times fairly low. The M31 comes with Android 10 pre-loaded and the dark mode is something I really love! The performance is smooth, the UI is neat and clean, and the display looks crisp with good vibrancy. I really like the camera\'s performance in daylight and the quality of the images is quite sharp. However, I felt that low light photos are quite decent and could be better. The phone feels slightly heavier than the M30s because of the bigger battery but the difference is not very noticeable. I bought the Space Black version and while it looks classy, it does pick up fingerprints easily. I would recommend getting a case for that reason, even though the phone is quite comfortable to grip. Ergonomically, the buttons are well-placed and the fingerprint sensor works really well. I feel that on the whole, the phone is perfect for anyone looking for a durable device that can cover all the bases within the 15-20K range!PROS- Battery Life- Daylight Camera- Display- Android 10 UICONS- Night Shots- Spammy notifications (can be easily disabled)\n', "\nUsing this mobile for the last 3 months. It means I bought it just after launch 😁. My opinions about this mobile:* Found as expected or claimed by Samsung*Fast and accurate fingerprint reader, working even if there is some dust on fingers.*Normally I don't use camera for hobby, only for scanning office documents and it clicks very clear details.*After office hours I stream videos from different apps and battery helps me to watch.* Inbuilt Samsung VPN is also helpful.*Samsung UI is simple and not messy like other brands.* I missed to buy Samsung care due to no full information.* In last 3 months I found that the device automatically restarts anytime without doing anything, but now the problem is gone. Don't know why\n", '\n\xa0Writing this review after using this phone approx 26 days..So there will be complete review about this..Why i brought this:-Because i want to switch more safer android smartphone, market of samsung is less than others cheap prices tag company phones but in Android nothing is more safer than samsung.. because there security patch is better in terms of all..Also i need better UI, i was earlier using MIUI, & want to use new Ui specially with flagships tag phones..In world people prefer Apple than samsung..In India we brought what we saw is cheaper or just processors.What they "भाई इसमे snapdragon hai" just snapdragon doesn\'t makes ur phone good or best..Samsung has world class infrastructure to provide the best thing to u not just anything without prior experience...So heres few things i like most..1. Super Amoled Display: its having suoer amoled display which is way better than anyone in this budget.. as samsung super amoled consider as best due to high ppi.. which makes every dot if colors very good..Suitable for netflix, prime, video watchers .2. Battery: it has 6000 mah battery which is highest in this budget segment with 15W fast charging, took almost 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%But belive me if its charge 100% use continuously till evening, and still u have 20-30% left..PS: normal use, not games..3. Quad camera: it has quad camera 64-8-5-5 which is also not available in this budget segment in any others..Same configuration..Plys sasmung has better image processing softwares and good sensors..Hence the camera quality is also good... I had attach pics too..64 mp main camera, 8mp wide angle, 5 mp macro camera, 5mp depth camera.. 32 mp front camera..With 64MP Ultra-High Resolution ISOCELL also Bright GW1 image sensor.Slow mo with super slowmo which is way better, live focus, night mode is excellent... 4K recording from front as well as primary cameraAll these are good...4. Exyons 9611: it has Exyons 9611 which is better than many processor, it runs PUBG as well as many heavy games at HDR quality without any frame rate down, not even lags..So good one.. yes its not better than snapdragon but yes it works better till now i found nothing negative from processor..5. Audio: it has one good quality of speakers and very loud..It comes with Dolby atmos hence using external source of speakers from this phone is way better....Best phone in under 20K segment, i brought this in 17K 6-128Gb configuration..If u want this for just only Gaming than dont prefer this, if u want daily use mobile with less gaming, and high usage of videos, social sites surfing etc than its best one...What i was thinking to get more1. Gorila glass 5 for screen instead of 32. Face lock little bit faster (although no use of face lock bcoz maximum prefer finger lock)3. Liquid cooling technology if possible (bcoz if u play pubg for more than hours in full settings it will heat little bit but not as Xiomi phones did)4. Want some more colors.. only royal blue & black with plastic body.. still it looks betteeI m using black one..5. Atleast add Case in mobile box, only charger provided...I hope i added the valid points....PS:- it is made in India, and has no links with China bcoz samsung has world largest factory in Noida where these phones were made, not assembled.. most of the parts were manufactured in India, only super amoled screen shipped from South Korea and few other parts from various countries..As all company\'s did.. but has no link with china.. for more google it\n', "\nSamsung is constantly improving its level..on mid range phone..If i talk about its...looks i think you may have to compromise a bit....but wait a min..there's a lot imp things rather than looks...1.Camera✌ 💖----- Awesome camera quality, some says that there is no zoom feature in 64mp mode..yes it is right...but honestly speaking you dont require one, as the pic is so clear that...it really gives a stunning details.2. Battery✌💖--awesome battery power of 6000mh...if you are a heavy user I am dam sure this is gonna be a very plus point...One imp thing also...when I was buying this phone I got to know that it dosen't come with fast charging...and you have to wait 4 to 5hrs ...I was bit worried about that...but when I first charged my phone I was shocked to know that you can completely charge your phone in 60mins.3.Fingerprint✌💔---As usual you expect from Samsung it's awesome but...there is no..in display fingerprint sensor.4.Display💖💖---Its super awesome as its SuperAmoled5😔😔😔.The thing  from which I am disappointed is only that it doesn't come with..Samsung Knox.😔...but I think if you dont use this..then this phone is worth buying...but if you use this feature then shift to A-series...6..😉😉A most imp thing is I am a Samsung user from last 6years I can assure you Samsung gives...more than what is shown in display...as many small features which we use in daily are generally not covered in Advertisements.\n", "\nI ordered this set on the first day and the delivery was amazing.All the features of this phone are as advertised. The outer body is same as that of Galaxy M30s and M30. A little on the thick side due to 6000mAh battery.Camera and battery life are excellent. The charger that came along with my set was white in colour.Though, there is a bug in the phone (which is also found in Galaxy S10+) where the in-call speaker becomes your primary speaker. You can google about this bug. Hopefully, samsung will resolve it in the future updates.Android 10 and one core is great. There are application like Bixby vision, AR emojis which is novel and interesting. Game launcher is also great in managing and organizing games.Back cover is must as the back panel is shiny and smudges doesn't look great. Overall, the phone is great and price is reasonable.\n", '\nI bought this mobile after using the previous version. i.e. M30. compare to previous phone, this phone has really good improvements. Pros of the phone is given below1. Good battery life: Once fully charged I am using this phone for two days in normal conditions. Even if extensive gaming, battery longs for a full day2. Big storage helps you in storing large number of photos and data without thinking3. Amoled Screen gives you super fine experience while watching movies. I use mobile phone for watching movie even if my laptop has big screen only for its amoled screen expereince.4. I have been using it for around a month now and it never struck or were never lagging.5. I have played high graphic games like pubg. It supports wellHowever there is small con I noticced1. Camera is good. But if you want low light photography, it is not upto the mark\n', "\nValue for money: Truly a value for money phone, as in this range you are getting everything you need.Handiness: Great confidence on hold, I have always used phones without back covers and tempered glass. When I was buying this phone was thinking how will I manage this big phone but I was surprised as it is not slippery with a glass-like material which keeps your look on.Camera: Great camera, I am not much mobile camera freak but when I used it I found it extremely great in the range.Battery: It is fine, stays for 1.5 or 2 days was expecting it will last for more time but it is fine as there are many services which are continuously running so it's fine. And I was thinking that with 6000 mah battery it will be heavy but it's not as compared to other phones.Sound: Quality of sound is very good whether it is speaker phone or as you can play music aswell and it's enough for a small room.Screen: It is good, as it's a display and picture quality is great it shows real colours.Backside: I liked this new material by Samsung which is used in the backside of this phone, as when you hold your phone, you will not feel it slippery and in this range it is great, the only thing I felt is it's backside cover quickly captures the dirt of hand and drops handprints etc.\n", '\nI bought this phone because of the brand name "samsung". The first touch phone which I was used is Samsung(sliding type with touch). When I saw the add of this m31 I fixed this in mind.  This phone is one of the most fantastic phone which I have ever seen. There is no words to say about The Batery life. It is Amazing. I can watch continuously 6 movies from 100%. Still the charge is 50% only . Even in my nonstop use I am getting 2.5 days battery life. Camera quality is also an amazing thing. Video quality  is like a Digital camera video. Photos are getting more and more clear during zooming.  Camera clarity is supeeeeerrr..Fingerprint reader is excellent . It is too fast in unlocking using finger.Ram is also fabulous.  No hang or delay. Sound quality is also super.  From my point of view I have no negatives to say. This is an excellent phone . A huge facility in an affordable budget. I suggested this phone to 2 of my friends and the purchased too... so dear friends  pls choose this phone, u will not get this much features in any other phone. Others may have more features but they have no battery life and maximum 6 hrs back up. They have no brand value also. A small battery with more load can\'t use for more time. But our samsung is king. Pls try once u loved it u will not change ur mind.  Still I am fall in love with samsung. Especially the battery life... thank you samsung team for giving this gift to us. ........\n', "\nBefore reviewing my samsung M31, I would like to share what I was actually seeking in a phone.1. Best available battery life with fast charging2. Good audio quality in video recording (for uploading acoustic guitar covers on YouTube)3. A nice camera4. Good enough processor for multitasking5. Additional slot for expandable memoryThis M31 from Samsung proves great on all fronts as per my requirement.I am not a pro tech savvy who goes into the minute detail of every feature but would sum up the best I could experience in the last 5 days.Camera Quality - My wife loved it more than her One plus 6T, pretty unbelievable though. Both front and rear (4 lenses) do their job quite well.I video recorded a guitar cover and both picture and sound were upto the mark.Battery life- one full charge lasted around 36 hours on a normal usage. 0-100% charge took around 2.5 hours ~ 150 minutes.Gaming/Processor - Played Real cricket 20 and Gear club Racing, absolutely smooth.Feel of the phone - Slightly bulky due to heavy battery but that's okay.Most features similar to A51 but price almost 8k lower.For someone like me who doesn't like to spend more than 15k on a phone, this might be the best option for you.\n", '\ncoming from a Samsung S7 Edge, I always wanted a phone with an awesome screen and a good battery life. This phone has them both. Its a bit heavier than the S7 Edge, but it is because of the 6000mah battery. My usage is average and I have never experienced and issue with his one. first charging I felt that the phone was heating but that has stopped after the first software upgrade. Awesome phone for a budget.\n', '\nPros1. Excellent sAmoled display with stunning camera stills2. Superb battery backup with 6000 mah3. Blue light protector can be enabled to protect our eyes from harmful blue Rays emerge out of phones4. Average processor but ok5. Definitely a monster at this price rangeCons1. Mobile gets heated up bit while using camera and other apps continously. Also, during software update2. Full Mobile charging 1%-100% takes up to 2.5hrs for full charging as the charger is15w fast charger and not 25w charging like in other phones.Overall rating 4 and 1 star less for above cons.However,  an extraordinary mobile at this price range with a great brand SAMSUNG. Blindly,  go for it your budget is less than 15k\n', '\nHandson experience after 10 days.Really disappointing product from Samsung. This is utlra hyped product. Its a marketing stratagy of samsung to promote it. Only battery is the feature of the phone which last around 1.5 days on heavy usage. i am a game freak and it is good for that.The camera is pathetic mark my word pathetic its a 8 megapixel camera which they branding as 64 megapixel. when you zoom after cl8cking a photo there is no details. its all blurred out and you feel cheated like anything. the selfie camera sucks. Overall experience is bitter. I really dont like the smartphone. it is all plastic body and quite compressable. I have oppo reno phone i felt it is 1000% guinine than this cheating phone. Be aware before you buy. 2 star is only for battrry only battrry.\n', "\nMost recommended over other phones.Samsung M31 is an amazing phone with best features. It has 64 mega pixels camera(4 camera lenses) and fingerprint scanner at the back.Its has best sound quality and clarity of its back and front camera is extraordinarily amazing.This product has 64 gb internal storage which makes it better to store data.It has various inbuilt apps which are necessary for day to day life.The phone is a all rounder and it has strong and long battery life.If you buy this phone during lockdown, you won't wait for lockdown to end rather you will pray for lockdown to increase 🙂Also, the wide screen enables you to view smaller objects better. It also has wide length screen shot as feature.All of these features are available in brand like samsumg and at very reasonable price.If you have high speed internet and if you are into business or if you are service provider and you want to use this phone for your work then it is very useful.Please note these are my personal views based on my experience with this phone.Also, you may gift this to your loved ones in order to experience the joy they feel after getting best technology.\n", '\nNice phone, better camera in this price segment, gives extra sharp images with good lighting as being the photograh lover i know the canera quality and features well.Phone performance is ok, but not much impressive, having 8 GB RAm and 128 GB rom phone though it sometime hangs and show leg and slowness in performance.Main disadvantage of this phone is its facelocker ,it is very very poor, almost rarely it unlocks phone recognising the face and even takes much time in recognising.minimum it takes 2 or more second to unlock.Many feature are missing like - gallery and app lock, network meter\n', "\nOverall rating: 4/5Been using this as my primary and only phone for around 3 months now. So far so good. I'll keep this short and to the point:Pros:1- smooth operation most of the time.2- camera is really good. Good modes, good clarity. Sizable upgrade from my old moto g5s plus.3- screen is good. No complaints.4- audio quality is good but could have been better5- battery is a genuine masterpiece. Lasts close to 2 days with very heavy usage and that's good enough for me.6- happy that this is manufactured in IndiaCons:1- one major: occasional stutters. I don't know why but occasional app transitions stutter and it can get annoying. It's not very common but say I swap between WhatsApp and Reddit while typing something, there is a noticeable stutter. Hope this gets fixed.2- fingerprint sensor could use some speed enhancements3- facial recognition is in my opinion it's downside. I don't use it at all but it is very sloppy and inconsistent.All in all, phone does my daily activities well and I don't have too many complaints, but I'd have liked it if they fixed the stuttering.\n", '\nThis phone is worth buying. I will list pros and cons.Here are the pros:1. The very first thing to mention is the camera setup. The image quality is too good in this price range. Both front and rear camera can shoot FHD videos with slomo videos as well. The 64MP shooter does satisfying job.2. Second thing where samsung never disappoints is the 6.4 inches super AMOLED screen which is the best. The colors are very natural and prominent.3. The huge battery is far away from other phone which has endurance of around 1 and half days even after heavy use.4. The exynos 9611 works well for daily use.5. The phone is not at all heavy even if it has huge battery. The weight balance of this phone is great. Thumbs up for that.6. The One UI is the best. It gives a smooth experience on top of android 10.7. Physical fingerprint and face unlock both are fast.Here are the cons:1. First thing, I dont know why samsung is putting the same processor in all of their mid rangers. Though Exynos 9611 does a good job of daily use. But it will disappoint heavy users.2. The macro camera works good in better light conditions, though it is just to attract the customers.3. I have seen some glitches while switching apps. Hopefully samsung will take care of it in sytem updates.4. The speaker is decent but it gets covered while using phone and you may face problems while playing media.5. The deisgn of this phone is not eyecatching but its definitely not bad as reviewers tell.6. Samsung could have provided at least 25W charger. Charging speed is slow but its always a trade-off about what you need.\n', '\nI was previously using moto g5s plus and this was selected after comparing many models in this price range. Using this for the past 4 days. Everything is fine, the clarity, sound, network, net speed, gaming. Heard many negative reviews for the processor used. But comparatively no drawbacks. You can definitely go for this model. And to mention, the SAR value is also very very less in the price range.Battery life is only one day for full Internet usage and 3 hours of calls.\n', "\n●It is an amazing phone which provides all-round performance whether we talk of battery(which is the biggest current battery available the 6000Mah)●Its camera is also incredible as compared to other smartphones in this range. As well as above mid-range smartphones also doesn't have such camera (64+8+5+5). It also has AR Doodle and AR Emojis.●Next is its performance which is obviously one very nice. While playing PUBG one can easily enjoy the game on high graphics for long without major overheating issues.●Samsung is known for its security and it has provided:->Inbuilt McAfee antivirus protection,>Inbuilt VPN>Inbuilt WiFi protection.Also the OS and UI are amazing and very handy.It also has amazing split screen view which can even run in camera. And using pop-up view we can even open 5 APPLICATIONS at a time and even more.Users may not be able to find all these features in first time but will obviously able to find them by viewing some tutorial video of this beast smartphone.By using this smartphone one can surely say that this is a #MegaMonster\n", '\nReview after 7 days usage....Performance: 2/5RAM Management: 4.5/5Display: 5/5Camera: 5/5 (Front & Rear)Battery: 5/5 (Easily about 2 Days)Charging Speed: 2.5/5Fingerprint: 3.5/5Sound: 3.5/5 (Speaker & Earphone)Cellular Connectivity: 2.5/5Wifi: 3/5Weight Distribution: 5/5N.B.- 1.

No flaws.Battery: This is again a plus point in this  device, I use my mobile phone for 2  or 3 days once it's fully charged.Camera : 64MP camera has some dynamic  range issues but it is good for the  price segment.  128 MP camera performs good in  daylight not in night.  Macro lens is great.  I usually take less selfies. But the  selfie cam is pretty decent.Charging time for this device is long because of the monster battery.I do not play games on mobile phones.

Poor camera quality it showed its camera quality is 64 mp but back camera is like 5-8 ,mp n front is like 2 mp thats it...2.) Bettery backup:- too much dessapointed it takes more than 3 hours to full charge and after 7-8 continue used it again came at 5% from 100%..3.) Hanging issue:- sun can changes its direction but there is a strong connection i had noticed till now that is sumsung phones and its hanging issue..today after 3 months later i m very much sure nobody cannot improve sumsung's this issue..4.,) less features in front video:- if u are photography lover then Do not purchase it bcoz it has very low front video quality...5.)

It even hangs down while using simpler applications.4. The overall software is not user friendly, making simpler things complex.5. Not at par with Redmi phones. My Redmi Note 4 was better than it in many respects.6. The seller is casual and not competent enough as the packaging was quite imperfect for the phone. The phone box was simply kept in a big cardboard box alongwith some other item, without any cushioning. The seller should be blacklisted by Amazon.Redmi Note 8 Pro is a better option.

Few of my friends were chosen to give the first reviews and I am glad I believed them!The 64 mega pixel camera is fantastic and has a good AI attached to it because it can differ food objects and nature pretty vividly. The finger print sensor at the back is quickest indeed. And the battery life is super amazing too. Though the charging scene is a bit slow but it's okay to give that time off to the phone once in two days.I chose the 128 Gb option since I have a bundles of data to carry and the phone is clearly standing up to my expectations in the last 10 days.\n", "\nSamsung M31 is very good mobile.

The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to falling asleep playing on my mobile and using it, and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 64GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 64GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.\n', '\nDelivered on 23rd may, after 5 days of complete use I must say mobile is processing faster.Screen resolution is very bright and livid.Quality of mobile phone is very good considering the price tag.LIKES-1.

Face unlock quick and responsive.6. UI 2 makes mobile more exciting.7. Battery life very powerful- full1day on single charge including heavy games and online usage.8. Camera on daylight gives very good images.Dislikes1. Charging usually takes 3- 4 hours from 0 to 100.2. Camera dissapoints in night time pics.3. Plastic back body make looks cheap.4. Feels heavier during holding for a longer time.5. No earphones with mobile handest.  :(\n', '\nA good phone in this price range. Overall performance is satisfactory. Battery is getting a bit hot while using hotspot and calling simultaneously. Battery is good, but charging is not so fast. Camera is good, low light photography is very good. Front camera is also good with screen flash. Face unlock is not too intelligent to detect face always. Fingerprint reader is not very fast but manageable. Look is not very impressive. Glossy back cover easily gets dirty by fingerprints. However, it will score 7.5 to 8 in a scale of 10.\n', "\nAt first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.Pick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.When you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.The Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications and featuresThe spec sheet of the Galaxy M31 looks similar to that of the Galaxy M30s. It sports a 6.4-inch AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution. It also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection which should keep it from picking up scratches too easily. The display has good viewing angles and is legible when outdoors. There are two colour profiles to choose from, and you can also change the white balance.Samsung has retained the Exynos 9611 SoC from the Galaxy M30s. This is an octa-core processor with four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. For graphics, it has the Mali-G72 GPU. You get 6GB of RAM and a choice between a 64GB storage variant and a 128GB storage variant for Rs. 15,999 or Rs. 16,999 respectively. However, Samsung is offering a Rs. 1,000 discount which brings the prices down to Rs. 14,999 and Rs. 15,999 respectively. The duration of this offer has not been specified.Samsung has bumped up RAM on the Galaxy M31 compared to its predecessor which should give it some leverage while multitasking. We did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again.The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. We enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which should let you stream full-HD content.We ran our usual benchmarks on the Galaxy M31. In AnTuTu, it managed to score 191,981 points which are higher than the Galaxy M30s did. The Galaxy M31 also scored 348 and 1,247 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests. As for graphics benchmarks, the Galaxy M31 managed 41fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 8.9fps in GFXBench Car Chase\n", '\nI have been using this phone for over 2 months now. The major reason why I went for this model was its battery. After putting the phone to mild-high usage everyday (amdist the lockdown), the battery safely lasted just over a day (~26-28 hours). I use many services concurrently - Bluetooth, Data, GPS, Hotspot. So the battery drain in my device would be faster. In any normal use pattern, this battery can easily last a day and half. As far as charging is concerned, there are a lot of discussions online regarding the charging time for this model, as the charger comes with a 15W power capacity. From my experience, I would say, it charges fast untill it reaches a certain threshold afterwhich the charging becomes slow. So, you can expect your phone to buff up to around 40% battery in next to no time, but if you would like to completely charge the device, then leaving it plugged in as you sleep might be your best optionAnother great thing about Samsung M31 is its Camera. The front camera has 32MP and takes very beautiful selfies. In the Live Focus mode, you can blur off the background and obtain a high aperture-esque effect in your photos. The Macro mode is also very powerful and would be suited for subjects with high detail per unit area - an insect, a flower, a fruit etc. As a consequence, you will have to go up close to the subject to really appreciate the power of the Macro mode. This is made slightly difficult as the camera doesnt auto focus in the macro mode. But with Macro mode, you almost never get auto focus anyways. The main 64 MP camera is also quite sharp. Sometimes, you may be tempted to use the 64MP over the Macro Mode because of the quality the 64 MP camera packs in. I have not been able to step out and click landscape pictures using the 64 MP back camera, but if household images are to stand any testimony, this 64 MP beast must rival a mid range DSLR easily. If you download Lightroom from the App store (which is a free app by Adobe), you can get going with your new hobby and have some good impressionable snaps to show off. If you get used to these three camera modes, the other modes becomes largely redundant. Food mode and Night mode are probably helpful (Especially in low light)Only point where Samsung could have done better is the finishing of the product. The images put up on the website flatters the actual product. The back cover is a poly carbonate finger print magnet. It would be worth your money to invest in a back cover (As the package doesnt come with one included in it). Samsung has a lot of preloaded apps but you can uninstall most and for the ones which you cannot uninstall, you always have the option to mute notifications. The processor is a new chip and would obviously pale in comparison against the Qualcomms and Realteks, but with 15k you can only expect so much. I do not play large graphic intensive games on my device, so would not be able to tell the performance in those situations. But the phone holds itself in modest esteem when I tried Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, Plants Vs Zombies etc. Smooth and no problems. Media playback has also been satisfactory and the large screen really does help the resolution. Bear in mind, that for some videos on Youtube/Netflix/Prime, you wont be able to go the entire length of the screen. If you drag and stretch the video, you might fill the screen, but loose out on some details along the edges.All in all, this megamonster does all it promises and would really qualify as a great Value for Money option. If Battery and Camera is your thing, go for this product with your eyes closed!\n', "\nI bought this the day it launched. The very moment it was available for sale and got it at an affordable price of ₹14999, delivered the same day via Amazon Prime. Its been almost 15 days of heavy use nowWhat i liked:-Amoled screen is sharp and crisp at displaying. No faulty viewing angles. Drop notch is super stylish and gives a flagship look to the device. Videos can be cropped to fit by the finger pinching out action. i have never seen Adaptive Brightness work so well in any phone.-Fingerprint sensor is easy to reach at the back below the camera. Quick unlocking and Smart Unlock works well. Face unlock is accurate and works well too.-Quad Camera setup is one of the sleekest cameras and positioning looks fabulous. The camera is quick to focus, great depth, the 64MP produces sharp images with a focus on the smallest details too. It has features like Pro, Hyperlapse, SlowMo, SuperSlowMo, Panorama, Night mode, Macro (wide), Bixby Vision, AR emoji, Food, 4k video and so much more. The front camera is better than what it looks like. It has perfect positioning, quick to focus and great attention to detail too. Overall, the cameras themselves make this phone worth a buy. Not just better in this range of phones but also than most flagship phones in 40-50k range.-Android 10 & One UI2.1 are both very clean, precise and extremely easy to use. If you're on any os below 9, this will be a great upgrade.-The biggest reason i bought this was the 6000mAh monster battery, it is not surprising that they do deliver their promise in this case too. The battery does not exhaust easily. Being a heavy user this battery, after charged fully, lasts around 2.5 days for me. The 15W type C charger that comes in the box takes about an hour to charge it from 0 to 100%.-There is one external speaker towards the side of the charging port which produces clean and moderately loud sound. Dolby Atmos Sound is also an upgrade if you are looking for a surround sound experience. towards the other side of the charging port, you have a 3.5mm headphone jack.-The Samsung Exynos 9611 processor lives upto its name. It is faster than i had expected it to be. Also, there are separate slots for memory and 2 sim cards which is a major pro.-The phone in hand feels very light, despite its huge battery. The Ocean Blue colour looks sophisticated and might give the black variant competition.-The box has a 15W fast charger with cable, user manuals, ejection pin.What I didn't like-It might sound stupid but there is nothing that i did not like about the m31. Maybe they could have provided a headphone in the box but given the features of the phone at such a low price range, that is understandable. Other than that, the phone has delivered to all the claims that it made and I think it is one of the best phones i have owned so far. Great competition in this range. Highly Recommended.\n", "\nI'm reviewing this phone after 3 weeks of usage. The phone is good if you are using it for normal usage. The 6000 mah battery can give you more than 24+ hrs if you just listen to music, use social media, and click pictures. here are the pros and cons:Pros:1) Big Battery: can give 1+ days using medium usage and 30+ hours if it's very light usage2) Nice display: sAmoled display is great and its the best in this price range3) Daylight photography nice: the colors are very accurate.4) Nice sound: it has a single speaker but the sound quality is nice5) The UI i.e One  UI 2.0 is very clean and nice to use.Cons:1) Uses Exynos 9611 chipset which is not best when compare to snapdragon 712 or MediaTek G90t.2) Camera2api is limited you don't get level 3 support so no Gcam available3) The stock camera is nice for daylight photography the colors are nice but during the night the quality is very bad the night mode does not work as well as it is supposed to do. Samsung can improve this is the upcoming update if they want its just a software issue.4) The updates are very less in Samsung smartphones. The phone is having a February security Patch. This can also improve the security patch updates  can be frequent.5) One more con is the details in the photos are missing due to the aggressive noise cancellation algorithm used by Samsung./when you zoom into photographs the details are missing. But in 64mb mode the details are present but it can also be done in 16 MB photo also.6) The battery takes approx 3 hrs to charge in spite of fast charging which is only 15 watt i.e adaptive fast charging as it is called by Samsung. If you use are charger having more than 15 watts rating it will still only take 15 watts of power from that charger. Samsung must allow the usage of more than 15-watt charger via software update if possible because to charge such a big battery in less time at least 30-watt charging should be allowedConclusion: if you are not a gamer and use your phone just to listen to music, click pictures, and use Facebook, Instagram, etc then this is the phone for you. You get a Samsung brand phone for such a price point with sAmoled display 64 MB camera, nice audio. There are some issues related to camera which can be fixed via updates like full camera2api support, improved night mode, and so little camera improvements and the frequent security updates should be provided.Overall: 8.5/10Camera: 8/10Sound: 9/10Display: 10/10Performance: 9/10Battery: 10/10\n", "\nReceived this from Amazon a week back. Here is review after a week's usage -1) The build quality of phone certainly ferls premium for this budget.2) Display is where I believe this device will surely outclass it's rivals. 6.4inch SAMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution looks gorgeous and colours pop out brilliantly. Even in direct sunlight I have no issues in seeing the content.3) Camera quality is top notch even in low lighting conditions whether it be 64MP Rear cams or 32MPFront, I infact felt the front camera better than my Galaxy Note 10+ in certain lighting conditions. Plus you get quad camera setup with ultra wide, macro and 4th cam for depth sensing, slow motion, 4k video shoot at 30fps.4) Battery life is Terrific, 6000MAH lasts easily 2 days on a moderate usage with 4g Calls, WhatsApp,  fee gaming, browsing and youtube content. Icing on the cake is it comes with a 15w fast charger which is superb.5) Biometrics works just fine wether it's fingerprint or face unlock, accurate and fast.6) Best part is it comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is quite a feature these days. Although Samsung could have provided a headphone with it which I feel is a mandate, but nevertheless the prescene of 3.5mm jack won't feel you sad about it.7) Internal 6gb of ram and 64gb of storage for base model is quite decent and performance is is quite good. It's fast, there is no lag in any apps. Morever you can expand it via external micosd card upto 1TB.8) It has an inbuilt FM Radio which was quite surprising feature. There is one bottom firing speaker which ain't stereo but it's quite loud. Can't expect everything at this pricepoint. Moreover you get Dolby Atmos feature as well so mulimedia experience is quite good.9) It comes with android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 which I think Samsung has done quite a good job balancing the design, features & usability where I think it's close to being the best software experience on an android. It's easy and clean to use.10) Overall a well made device with a good usable feature set and good performance, great cameras, terrific battery and software experience. Would highly recommend it as one of the purchasing options while buying a phone in this pice range.\n", "\nGiving this review after 4 days of use. I was the ios user but now I am realizing that spending too much on phones which people used to change in around two years is a waste of money. Hence shifted to Android (Galaxy M31).Firstly I was thinking about Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, but since it is a product of Chinese Company, so stooped there only. Too much Patriotism :).Pros-- The phone looks beautiful.- The display is awesome, played some 4k videos from youtube. Screen quality is really awesome. It also has Blue light filter functionality. You can schedule the same as per your need.- The overall performance is good. No heating. Played general games (NFS etc) and it worked really well- 6000 Mah battery is really big enough for me (comparing with iPhones). Lasts for almost 1.5 Days with general use.- 64 GB storage is sufficient and you can expand it to 512 GB with an external card.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone. The phone came with a 30% charge. Charged fast.- The camera is good. The macro camera works perfectly fine. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.Since I am not a photographer, this is more than enough for me.- Fingerprint and Face recognition is good (Don't want to compare with apple.)Cons -- The phone is a little heavy and not slim (But it doesn't look bulky, it really looks awesome)- There were some claims that it takes 160 minutes to charge from 0-100% which is wrong. This phone takes around 3.50 hours for full (0-100) recharge.- There is no earpiece provided by Samsung.Overall this Phone is really a must buy in this price range. Don't go with negative reviews.I have seen some reviews where people are saying the camera is not good. It is not justifiable to compare its camera with DSLR or any other high-end phones (For example iPhone 11) asYour DSLR can not make calls and much more other things what this phone canand Other high-end phones like iPhone 11 don't come in 16000 Rs.The camera quality is really good and you can go for it.\n", '\nWriting this review after using this phone for more than a month as my primary device.Not less than a Flagship phone at a very comfortably affordable budget. Slim, light weight and attractive desgine. Premium to hold and use. The screen is amazing and produces amazing colours.Pros :1. First of all amazing 64 megapixel camera shoots amazing and highly detailed pictures with amazing colours.. ultra wide angle camera of 8 megapixel is too good for landscape and nature photography.5 Mp Macro-camera and 5 Mp depth camera adds a special touch to this quad canera device..Front facing 32 Mp camera captures the true skin colour in almost every situations.The most amazing feature is its night camera which captures images better or almost equal to some professional cameras.It also offers 4k video and slo-mo on both i.e. front and rear camera and ultra slo-mo on back camera.2. 6000 mah battery is more than enough and lasts almost around 26-27 hours approx (am not a gamer or a heavy user but "always on display" is continuously on.)3. Amazing sound, loud, crisp and clear. Clear voice on calls.4. No heating problem while on charge or on call or while surfing internet for longer hours.5. Nice on screen animation and colour reproduction.Cons :1. The thing which matters the most is there are not much options in the PRO MODE.2. The keyboard lags a little bit and takes around 2 minutes to resume back.3. If you turn on the speakers while on call, you won\'t be able to hear anything the other person is saying from the other side.4. When you creat folders on the app screen and add apps on it, the apps would come out every time you restart the phone.5. There could have been more features in the phone as compared to other brands in this price segment like locks and security, dual apps, IR Blasters etc etc.Overall am quite satisfied with this smartphone as i wanted a camera centric phone with a large battery and this is absolutely that device.\n', "\nBest Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without doubtbest thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India seller. I ordered on the first day 5th March 2020 of online launch and am happy.

No issue- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n", "\nThis is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag.

I am a b&w photographer. I find it difficult to understand the whites while edits.Thickness.\n', '\nThere are some definite plus points about this phone:1. The BATTERY: Yeah, it\'s that big! The 6000mAh beast goes on for more than a whole day despite the continuous usage of internet (including Facebook, YouTube, Netflix etc.) Also, if you restrain from using the phone heavily while it\'s charging, the battery percentage goes from 20 to 100 within two hours.2. Camera: The 64 MP camera catches the details really well, although excess zooming may make the pictures appear pixelated.The wide angle lens gives a 123° view and sticks to the claims made. The main 64 MP camera has an autofocus, but allows manual focussing too.Macro 5 MP cam is a little disappointing as it captures unsatisfactory images in low light, but otherwise gives some great close-up shots.3. Processor: One needs to remember to do the software update once the phone is active. If not done so, you will certainly face lags even within the same app, not just while switching between different apps. Once that update is done, the phone runs ever so smoothly.P.S. I\'m not a video game player, so wouldn\'t know anything about the speed of those operations.4. Space: There\'s no particular need, but 128gb basic ROM is more than sufficient to incorporate all your favourite music, small video clips as well as movie files in . mp4 or .avi formats.5. Fingerprint reader: You HAVE to cover the complete scanner area. Thankfully, the phone gives suggestions like "cover the whole scanner" and "wipe off the water droplets".The phone doesn\'t heat up much during charging, just gets a little warm and that seems normal.Overall, if you\'re looking for a budget phone with good specifications that\'s made in India, you wouldn\'t regret buying this model.\n', "\nI have wanted to buy this phone ever since I saw it would be launching. However, I did wait for my 2nd PU exams to be over and when I checked back it was already out of stock. And later, when I did order it again my order got cancelled due to corona virus. I had to wait almost 2 months and finally got it gifted for my birthday. Those two months I spent heavily researching about the phone and it's competition. And honestly there were so many incidents when I decided to choose another phone. But my dad wasn't okay with me choosing Chinese brands.A piece of advice if you do buy it.. Please charge the phone completely before using it for the first time. It's really helpful. I've read many reviews here and everyone who found it faulty probably didn't charge it to 100% before first use (It does gets heated the first time. Don't worry about it.) Now to the review. Waiting two months eagerly for this... my expectations were as high as it could be and my phone did meet it a great extent.Fingerprint sensor is great though sometimes it does not recognize on the first try. But again for the budget it's pretty good.The display has to be the biggest pros of the phone. I was so obsessed with it I didn't even want to use a screenguard XD. It is very smooth and videos look great on it.The back of the phone also looks very attractive despite what I've read about it. It does get fingerprints all over it but nothing that can't be rid of.Face unlock I had to try just for the review and it is pretty good. (Keep in mind I tried it only for a few minutes, just a couple tries)Battery life is really good. I usually binge watch TV shows on my phone(10 hours approx.) and it would last for a day and a half. When I tried gaming, I didn't find any freezing or lagging. But the battery does start reducing a little more quickly ( It would still last for the whole day) and sometimes heats up but nothing to be worried about.Coming to the camera, the default camera is 16MP and you'll have to change it to 64MP and you can't zoom in using 64MP. Also it takes up more space. But the camera quality is pretty awesome. However the video and every other mode are in 16MP. The front camera default is 16MP too I presume, and ultrawide front camera is 21MP and you can change it to 32MP. The front camera is great too. However I don't recommend the phone to hardcore photo enthusiasts considering it might not meet your expectations. But keeping the budget in mind I give it 5 stars. The video mode is good however the super steady mode is very grainy.(I'm not sure how exactly it works yet). And the super slo-mo video can only be used in daylight for best results. Photos in lowlight are not the best. But there is a flash option for front camera where the screen goes bright white during a shot and it compensates really well. I was happy with most of the camera features but it isn't the best being a photo enthusiast myself. It still does a great job nonetheless. The performance is amazing. There are times apps start glitching but it's probably the app's fault and not the phone's.Talking about storage the system takes up 16GB and other 4GB gets used up while setting up. You basically get 108GB give or take as your storage(For 128GB variant). It's been almost 11 days since I got the phone and it's done a great job of impressing me and my family. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a budget friendly smartphone. And to those trying to cut off Chinese products.Overall I have had a pretty awesome and exciting experience with it so a five star rating. Totally would recommend.\n", "\nI'll start by saying this is the best Birthday gift I have purchased for myself, also my First Samsung phone.I will start with the my experience with the phone so far.Speed:- Great speed and touch response and Apps opening time is amazing- Phone boot up is quite fast- Fingerprint and face ID is very fast compared to In-display fingerprint- Gaming experience is good tooCamera:- Attached the shots, see the amazing close up and night mode- Super amoled display shows the  best possible colors- Steady camera, till not I haven't got a single blur picture or out of focus, which is amazing- Image process is impressive, no time delay in capturing and saving the imagesLooks:Trust if if anything matters the most to me is the looks of the phone, this phone looks amazing and quite attractiveOne small issue - a bit slippery, but a cover would take care of it. I'm not a cover fan though, I like the phone the way it is.Features:Fast ChargingAndroid 10 One UI2Memory Card slotBest - 3.5 mm Audio JackDolby Atmos sound6000 mAh - more than 48 hours with moderate usage and about day and half with extreme usageCharting time is about 30-45 minutesNO ADs - The best partSound: Quite loud, over calls as well on speaker side. That's what I loveTo be honest, I was so worried about transferring the data from old phone to new one, but found out the Samsung Smart switch app, within minutes every single thing(means everything) from old phone to new got transferred, absolutely had nothing else to do apart from installing the apps.Assistant is also quite nice.For me some things were hard to find in the new UI as I was used to other versions, but it has everything that other smartphones are offering and even better than others in the same price segmentSamsung Members is the place I found to be very helpful if anyone has any questions or issues to be discussed about the phone.The only thing that didnt impress me is the Dialer, its split in 3 parts (Keypad/Recent/Contacts), maybe i'm used to the one page Dialer thats why.Also the Notification menu, its quite big, I think considering the phone size its designed this way by Samsung.I'm glad I chose a great birthday gift for myself, I sure am satisfied with the product. Thanks\n", "\nThis phone is overall good for its camera quality, battery backup and its processor. Camera quality is great compared to other phones of this price range. Processor is very fast, as you can open up 4-5 apps in pop up window and the phone dosen't even lag a bit, not to mention gaming- smoothest gameplay you could ever get in this price range.All that aside the best feature is its battery backup, with a full charge your phone will easily last about 2-3 days over its normal day to day usage.Fast charging dosen't satisfy much as it takes around 2 hours to charge from 30-100%.If you're ordering online, make sure to add to cart a tampered glass and back cover along with it, as these are not included in the box, also make sure its of good quality becausethe glass may brake if the phone hits the ground with the corner side.In short, its an awesome phone and you'll definitely love it...\n", "\nThe Samsung M31 is a power packed performer not only among it's equivalent price range smartphones but comparative to all high end phones available in the market today.1. Overall Handling is quite satisfying. With an Amoled Screen and a good resolution perfect for binge watching. You can switch between Vivid and Natural colours though (don't know why it comes in vivid default).2. Has a 64 MP rear camera with ultra wide and depth however as anyone would have a nick for wanting the best, there still is room for improvement.3. Comes with Face recognition and Finger print scanner, however there is a fraction of a second's lag while unlocking the phone. Recognition does get better with more use.4. Has an inbuilt Optimiser in the UI with anti-theft features to clear up memory,check battery usage and scan through an inbuilt antivirus. So that is an addition, however a third party antivirus should still be used as back up.5. The smartphone boasts of a 6000mAH mega battery and it lives up to the figure with 9-10 hrs of battery if used continuously and upto 2 days with normal to minimal use(Frankly speaking I gifted the phone to my mother and was surprised to see it working at 28%, the day after it was charged..also it was charged in the evening around 5 pm...so still not 2 days). The Charger supports fast charging but I wouldn't compare it to One Plus' dash charging as it would take upto 150 mins to reach full charge on M31.Eventually I did want to buy one more for myself,but there already is one M31 in the family.A great buy.\n", "\nThe phone is really awesome and worth to spend 16k on. It is very handy, looks nice (back should have been given some gradient design), and very light weight. Operation is very smooth. It is so user friendly that it assists searches, it has settings for almost everything you see on the phone which means you need not compromise with how it asssits you. The best thing I liked is its focus mode which is a must have in any student's phone...also we can create our own mode where we can decide which all applications we must be able to use while having a me time.6 gb + 128 gb is too much to get for 16k from such a reputed brand like samsung. I have been using this phone for past 3 days and it has not made me disappointed. This phone is made for normal users where all your needs are met. Voice quality is good on call, speakers are not so loud,battery backup is awesome with 6000 mah. Options to delete screenshots after sharing was another awesome feature. My gallery used to be flooded with unwanted screenshots and now its solved. Its size is also good. Enough for reading pdfs and watching movies and won't hurt your thumb after long use. I have a suggestion that the pack could have included a back cover also as most of midrange phones comes with backcover with it. Battery takes about 2 and a half hours to get fully charged from nearly 0. Phone comes with android 10. Photos taken are okay. I'm not a photography person. I'm really happy with my choice... Samsung has not disappointed me this time also. I happily suggest Samsung M31 to any normal user.\n", '\nPerformance, Display and Battery: Overall speed is good. But touch is not respond properly, like small buttons or moving buttons while playing games. Display resolution is not upto the mark, easily get to know while playing 1080p videos. Battery life is excellent. If you are not play games or paly much videos, would have use 2 days.Camera: 64MP is for gimmick, that is not up to the mark. Take a picture and zoom it, pictures will be blur. Redmi note 8 48MP far better than this. Day light camera is avg but  low light quality too poor. Macro camera quality is good. Overall camera is can say 2 out of 5 star.Would have decrease 2k or 1k in a price. But overall not bad.\n', "\nNewly purchased samsung m31 quite satisfied with the phone. In fact, loving this #MegamonsterThings to know before buyingM31 offers One UI 2.0 (based on Android 10)\xa0which is out-of-the-box.A smooth Android skin, it works well on most Samsung smartphones and has a few nifty features –\xa0Always-On Display,\xa0Ultra Data Saving, and\xa0Dual Messenger\xa0– that add to the package.6.4 full hd Super Amoled display is just Amazing which I couldn't find in other phones in this segment. It gives an enriched experience while watching Netflix or prime. It supports 4K as well.The colours are vibrant and punchy and the text is sharp and  the sunlight legibility is also quite good.It has a 6000mah mega monster battery which I love the most. Easily it last for 1.5 or 2 days. And it takes 2.5 hours or less for full charging. Trust me I use my phone for around 12-15 hours a day. With this monstar battery, phone doesn't seem heavyweight. Well done! SamsungThe Samsung Galaxy M31 consists of a\xa064-megapixel primary sensor, an\xa08-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a\xa05-megapixel macro sensor, and a\xa05-megapixel depth camera, which produce great results in day-time. The images captured by the 64-megapixel sensor have good details and great dynamic range32 MP selfie camera is amazing.It supports slow motion, live focus as well Overall phone is awesome. If looking for a phone under 15000, I would suggest this is best phone in the market with samsung brand value.\n", '\nThe Samsung Galaxy M31 is decently and simply designed when it comes to budget smartphones. There isn’t too much going on but whatever we have on our plates is still eye-pleasing. When I first held the Galaxy M31, it appeared quite bulky. But as it adjusted to my hands I got to know it was lightweight after all. Made up of polycarbonate, the device comes in two colour options: Ocean Blue and Space Black. I got hold of the black colour and loved the classic black tone of the device, which can never go wrong for a smartphone or anything painted in black. Although the smartphone doesn’t have a glass back, it doesn’t come last in the design race and offers us a sleek, not-so-cheap, and sturdy design.The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch. It is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is slightly disappointing. The smartphone has a number of display features, which are mostly in the case of every Samsung smartphone. There is Adaptive Brightness, Blue light filter, Dark mode, a choice between Vivid and Natural display colours, Always On Display, Accidental touch protection, Touch Sensitivity and more. While all the display features prove to be helpful, the accidental touch protection doesn’t really provide any protection as the device could easily be accessed accidentally.Finally I will suggest others to buy this mobile because of the excellent functionality and features\n', '\nAfter 5 days of usePros1) prompt finger print and face authentication. Face recognition is too fast.2)Camera quality natural. Quard camera +64 Mega pixel is the best.3) Gigantic battery life. With all day use of netflix and toutube video, tuning songs , games..4)it has real HD quality display , suitable for streaming netflix and youtube videos.5) i feel it has light body due to fibre back cover.6)Above all has the brand logo of samsung..Cons1)I thought that there was disturbance and noise while phone call.. and i was annoyyed but figured out that it was the network problem of sim operator..So the conclusion is no cons yet\n', "\nGot it delivered in just 2 days! Big thumbs up to Amazon for prompt delivery 😁Have been using this since 2-3 days now.It's a decent device for the given price range.Bought Samsung as I had decided not to go for any Chinese brands and I have no regrets!

Apart from these few cons, the device is really good for the given price! I'd suggest everyone to get this device rather than going for some other Chinese Brands!\n", "\nFinger print reader lags a bit and is not as fast as the phones other competitors whereas the camera is definitely worth the price (In fact more than value for money). I have compared M31's camera with other brands such as OnePlus and it gives them a competition (But obviously not overpowering them). Bettery life is something that I shouldn't even speak about, the phone lasts for more than 1.5 days for me and when full charged .... 😂 6000mah is all I need to say. This pgone overall is totally worth it, no lags as such. Samsung phones generally have poor GPS but there's no such problem with this phone.

Added to this is Samsung brand value and the service is also very good. The only concern with this phone is that it’s back panel is polycarbonate and there is no design effect on it.

TBH, I was about to buy Redmi Note 8 pro which is in same price range as this one but after thorough comparison i bought Samsung M31.Pros :1. Amazing camera. Samsung's M31's photos are more lively and provide you natural element of the clicking environment.2. Battery Life. It takes upto 2-2.5 Hrs to fully charge the phone and you can use the phone for almost whole day. whole day because at the time of writing this review Lockdown is going on India due to Corornavirus, so i am  always watching Videos and surfing Instagram and Facebook in it.3. Amoled screen - gives you amazing experience with Videos and movies.Cons:1. Not for Gaming - Since i am not gamer, this device perfectly suits my needs. But If you are interested in playing games i would suggest to go with other devices.2. Charger - Should have given more powerful charger since 6000mah takes alot of time to charge the device with the provided charger.3. Back of the phone does not feel premium.

I dont think this phone can handle heavy gaming. The only game I play on this phone is coin master and I've seen that game not load or just close on its own like 5 times in the 2 weeks I've owned this phone. Camera isn't that good. Display is ok. But its the large battery that is the only reason I bought the phone, and it does last long. Light gaming, YouTube, instagram, twitter, and other daily tasks is no problem for battery life. You can easily see 9+ hours of screen on time, I've seen as high as 11+. I was glad to see there is no idle battery drain. I go to sleep with the battery at 90% and when I wake up in the morning the battery is still at 90% or sometimes 89%. Which is great.\n", '\n\xa0Everything is Super Duper. All expectations from Samsung about this phone  came true. I was waiting for this phone since February when I listened on Amazon.The Battery 6000 MH and 6 GB RAM is enough for playing PubG and other Games without any Problems. 64 Mega pixels camera is good for capturing our memories. Mobiles look is slim and wait only 191gm with 6.4 inch screen. One more thing which I like is dual 4g support sim which was my problem in my Old Model J5 Prime.I always used Only Samsung phone (after Nokia keypad) in my Life.\n', "\nActually I just saw the features of the phone and ordered it.......after that I saw the positive and negative reviews of customers...I was really worried about my phone....but luckily I got best mobile.  I am reviewing this phone after 5 days of usage.CAMERA QUALITY-so nice. actually I compared the quality with other pixel mobiles.FINGER PRINT AND FACE SCANNER-We can easily unlock the phone...I didn't found any default in it.BATTERY LIFE-It is good and I compared with my previous mobile which is 4000mah.according to mobile description it should work for 21hrs with internet but It worked for 15 hrs...I calculated the screen time of mobileCHARGING-It takes about 175 minutes to charge from 0 to 100%And all other features like speaker...etc are all fine.but charging wire is very small.\n", '\nAfter using this mobile for two days now im comfortable to write the review.Pros1.Strong battery back up(i got 16 hours backup without playing games but i was continuously using internet)2.camera is way better3.Screen experience is too good.4.UI5.No heating effect while charging the phone6. Dual 4g7.No lagging in apps as they have provided  6gb RAM8.128 GB ROM which is enough9. Big batteryCONSBiggest issue is about network.Netowrk is not consistent through out so be aware of this.1.Fingerprint sensor on back side.It should be on screen or it should be imposed on lock key2.Material finishing looks cheaper they have used plastic as compared with other brands.3.Charger should be 30W but m31 is with 15w charger as it takes time to charge4.In the same price range other brands are giving fastest cpu where as samsung is giving middle class processor to samsung is giving its processor5.As it is 10nm technology  it reduces battery stand by time while other brands uses 8nm which saves the battery.6.Charger and mobile design need to be changed.\n', '\nAbsolute winner in this price segment.(6gb 64gb)Ocean blue color is pretty decent and cool.No lag. Multi tasking, split screen , call quality, signal reception is excellent. Best is the screen and battery life. For 2 hrs of pubg , 1 hr of ludo/ candy crush , chatting, streaming contents/ social networking for 2 hr , the battery remains at 35-40 percent on wifi and 25-30 % on jio LTE data.Camera is good in bright light.Got this phone only for its monster battery backup, but it came out to be a all rounder.\n', "\nWell,I had a doubt if i could purchase this phone or not!moreover I was between the devil and the deep sea!I wanted to gift this for my dad for his 50th birthday being a teen habit I saved as much I could and thought of spending my money to get my dad this soon the phone arrived and I had an etching desire to open this and somehow gave this as a present to dad🥰he was word stuck and all wondered if that was brought from my own savings I was still 17 and none could believe I take this special section to thank the #MEGAMONSTER team for making my dad's birthday a remarkable one thanks again!! About the phone it was worth the money and was radiation radiationless reg. The camera it is wow very peculiar and more significant for capture.... on a overall the team had put a tireless effort in making this phone a great success.. cudos to the team.. and wish n hope that God should bless you people with all the good health, success and abundance of happiness in making this modela great grand success❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤\n", '\nI have been using this phone for the last 2 months and I am very satisfied with the performance till now.Pros1) Good Camera. Crisp picture quality. Wide angle facility with background  blurring facility.2) Enormous Battery backup. It lasts me 2-3 days.3) Quite a good amount of memory (128k). Those who do not load huge games, this memory is huge.4) Quite a big screen. Aspect ratio is such that it is comfortable to hold.5) Super Amoled display given crisp picture on the screen.6) Though it has a 6000 mAh battery, the phone is not very heavy.Cons1) Though the fingerprint reader is far better than than earlier Samsung phones, it still needs to improve. The location of the fingerprint reader at the back of the phone is a little cumbersome to operate. On-screen fingerprint reader would have been preferred.If you are looking for a decent good phone within this budget, go ahead and buy it. It is absolutely the best buy at this price.👍👍👍\n', "\nThings that this phone does not live up to its promise:1. Front camera quality is not good. Dosent feel like a 32 MP definitely. Don't forget to  turn off the beauty mode.2. The night mode amplifies  up things artificially3. The main camera does not live upto the 64 mp hype- 48 MP cameras of other phones may be better. However for the price the macro, background blur effect and daylight photos are good.The operating system with the android  10 is good, screen quality is super, built is nice, fingerprint  sensor  very responsive,  no lags, decent sound quality, super battery.\n", "\nProduct is ok...Positive:-1)Charge is drained 100% to 70% from 7 am to 4 pm (including data and phone calls) ...2) Call audible quality is good...3) Device Weight is low when compared to Realme4)Display quality is good...5) speaker sound is good..6) Selfies is good in low light areas....7) Auto call record is availableNegative:-1) Rear Camera quality is not much high... It's an average quality... photo pixels are broken2) Heat of the device is little bit high when data is on3) There is no more accessories except Charger adapter and charger cable4) Noice cancellation is an average... Surrounding noise is heared to opposition5) Charging the device from 0% to 100% is 2:45 mints because of 15W charger6) Face unlock not working in low light areasOverall Product is good for battery backup usersAnd not well in Camera users\n", '\nFor office goers , home makers, I would say this is the best phone with best specification from a well known brand. I am writing this review after 5 days of decent use. Battery can survive for 2 days easily even with decent data usage. No heating issue. 64 MP Camera and video quality is so good like a flagship phone. Without a cover, the phone is too slippery to handle. Wide angle camera quality is okay but I don\'t use it frequently so it is not a big compromise. Selfie camera with 32 MP is a good trade off. No lag or delay in graphics, the transition is too smooth. Gorilla glass 3.0 is very helpful. Speaker sound and quality is very decent enough. Great Audio quality while using this M31 with bluetooth headset especially with "Dolby Atmos" effect on, which I didn\'t expect. I was planning to buy M30S, but after knowing the launch of M31, I was waiting for 15 days to book this one. Having a 64 MP camera phone would definitely need a 128 GB storage to store your beautiful memories. Worth buying, go for it.\n', '\nWorst ever phone any one can buy ...really shameful that these type of third grade products are being sold on Amazon. I ordered a Samsung phone on 14th March it was defective so a replacement was sought on 20 th march but due to lockdown andreturn pickups not happening it could not happen finally Amazon person came in JUNE but refused to replace it as its outer cover was not there I pleaded but he refused to budge I was left with a defective piece so went to service center my phones camera ,Jack, battery have been replaced but still issues are there , a brand new phone turned out to be a dud...really shocking even now battery drains too quickly...in this price range many phones are available please dont go for it ..worst ever purchase with zero service from both amazon and samsung .P.s - there service  center will keep on saying that no parts are available and will keep your phone for around a week. So have another phone ready with you as you will need it.My honest advice dont buy this phone.\n', '\n- 128 GB storage is pretty good.- supports 512 GB memory card with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone.- Rear Camera is really good.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good.Overall I can say is best one at this price.As of now no negative side / disadvantages.Will update again I find any.\n', '\nPros of M31*Wonderful performance while comparing with all other m series*Awesome battery stand by*Beautiful finish*Switching over apps was much quicker*I love those application usage timers in it this could reduce our addiction over any applications*Onto the cameras this stands at top level among other brands as well those 64MP primary made some extraordinary pictures*Added advantage of fast charging and those wide angle focus in cameras are pretty lovlyIn general this was an wonderful product and customer satisfying one!!!!Cons*Mobile weight was little bit heavier if you are preferring to a back case*Cameras were designed to be bulged from the back surface that could lead to sketches if there is any rough handlingI have seen too much of advantages and exiting features and some disadvantage like weight,etcSometimes i pefer weightless gadgetsOver all this mobile will get a rating of 4.6/5\n', '\nOverall phone experience is awesome.1. Screen- Amoled screen in very good and smooth, colours are very good.2. Body- Phone body is very good and slim.3. Camera- 64mp camera is provide in this phone but reality is different its looks like 32 mp camera and front camera is 32mp but reality looks like 16mp. Overall performance of camera is good not excellent.4. Battery- It has 6000 mah battery. Battery performance is very good but feature of fast charging is a joke. Battery takes 3 to 4 hours fully charged.5. Fingerprint reader is awsome.\n', "\nThis is a monster mobile. Monster in good sense. Very good battery life well full battery charge take some time well its obvious its 6000 mah battery. Camera quality is best. Not tested 64 mp till now coz its 3 days review, front camera is really awesome. Single speakers and its loud enough. Did not received  earphones in the box, apart from that its the best mobile under this budget. 4.5 star go for it. More over It's Samsung.\n", '\n1-The Galaxy M family has now transformed into a much bigger lineup and garnered a lot of attention,2-It offers very good battery life dats long for a 2 & half day backup..3-Scrolling through One UI 2.0 was smooth and apps were quick to open as well. Throughout our week-long usage, we did not encounter any slowdown or lags while using different day-to-day apps for messaging, social media browsing and so on.\xa04-it does manage to click shots that are generally pleasing to the eye and come out with rich colour and enough detail, its just possible because of wide angle and monster 64 cam..5-In the real world, this ultra-wide lens adds an all-new way to look at frames and click pictures fitting in more space than you would be able to use a standard smartphone camera.6- fingerprint sensor captures impulse on d go .. Backcover is very shiny carbonate piece making it light weight .....Excellent monster features on d goooo!!!!!\n', "\nThis phone from Samsung is worth for money it has stunning camera quality and the pics taken by this mobile is like a DSLR photograph it has very good battery but if u play games like PUBG mobile for too long then the battery life may reduce and it's finger print sensor is so good so far there is no issues.in simple words Samsung galaxy M31 is worth for money mobile phone if ur a mobile photographer this is the best and cheap option and for gaming it's okay but can't play for so long like 3 or 4 hours that's the reason I gave 4stars for the battery Life.For normal usage and photography this battery life is good.i prefer this mobile to people who r interested in photography and recording videos and normal gaming\n", '\nBefore m31 I have m30s  which is one of the best smartphone coming up at that range. Now as the upgradation move on m31. The camera quality with quad 64 MP rear camera comes with different modes is amazing and spiced up with Bixby vision you can click pictures that hard to differentiate from HD wallpapers. With the 6000 mAh battery can endures your smartphone processes for as long as 1 day of continuous activity (non gaming) Fingerprint is perfectly sensitive and better than compare to m30s. 6 GB RAM can provide perfect speed throughout the running apps. Best part about it sAmoled screen is one of the best features that make it different from other phones the colour quality because of that is completely amazing and on top of that while comparing it to iPhone 8 screen for sure samsung going to win over.\n', '\nOne of the best phone to buy in a range of 15k -25k.I am feeling so happy while using it.Pros:- 1 - The processsor is super fast and we can easily multitask without any lag.2- The reason why i choose this phone over Redmi was the AMOLED display offered by samsung which is awesome. Now i can watch movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime with better picture Quality as it feels like i am watching in a theatre.3- Sound Quality is super as it provides with DOLBY ATMOS in this range .4- The amazing part is that it has a battery of 6000mah which is impossible to get from any great brand like Samsung. I charge it after 3 days if using on a normal basis.5- The camera of this phone makes your picture is being clicked by a DSLR. I have now started using this for clicking my pictures and stopped using my DSLRThis phone is a go ahead and experience the great features with it.I strongly recommend to go for Samsung M31\n', "\nMobile features justifies with its name that is mega monster.Pros.1. Battery life- as I'm using mobile from last 7 days it's battery life is beyond my expectations. I'm heavy user and battery running life is arround 48 hours.2. Camera- four different cameras works in very good manner. Picture quality is excellent. When i zoom the picture it don't make blurred pixels.Front camera is also doing it's duty strongly.Mobile with latest features are excellentFew of them are pop up screen, side button uses, good adoption of fingerprint sensor.And the best thing is its super amoled display makes this mobile very attractive.Cons.If i talk about mobile cons there is only one what i get is- facelock feature is not working as good as i expected.Rest choice is yours, but after using this mobile i have recommended my friends to buy this mobile, and give you suggestion the same.In it's price segment it's really mega monster.\n", '\nThe Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g. The weight of the smartphone is mainly because of the big 6,000mAh battery that it packs. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with an Exynos 9611 SoC and gets 6GB of RAM. It has two storage variants to choose from, 64GB and 128GB.The 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight. I think so this is the best phone realeased by the samsung upto the date under 20000rupees which serves with monster camera means quad camera of 64mp and 38mp front and back respectively.last bur not the least it has monster battery and the fast fingerprint reader and facereader.you can even create your emojis in it. Worth for money.i would really like to thank samsung to create such revolutionarie phone under 20000rupees\n', "\nThis is not for professional users. This does not have any security feature. You cannot lock any app and it does not have any secured folder. It's required to store any password or important data. Some times our mobile will be used by friends or kids, during that time this phone is not useful ,No privacy or security. Installing third party apps for this purpose may be risky.I used J7 series earlier, in that feature was there whereas in m31 it's not there. I have seen many reviews and no one mentioned about this.Finger print reader you have search. Back cover and sensor almost  same texture.Charging is normal only not fast. Audio output in below speaker is not enough.When flash is used video is coming black  in slow motion camera.It's easily getting heated up. After video recording u cannot make call comfortably. Near ear piece it's hot.Overall I feel disappointed with the security feature.\n", "\nThe phone is absolutely amazing!!! I have bought it myself on the very first day of the sale, and by my usage of about 9 to 10 days, the phone is absolutely killer. Although it's not aimed for gamers in mind, the m31 still pulls off games with great ease and no lag. Moreover, the phone feels lightweight as a feather despite packing in a 6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging, which charges this battery in about 2 hours. The display is the best part of the phone. Extremely gorgeous display with a small notch. Moreover, the quad camera array at the back houses an 64 MP camera, which gives extremely detailed photos. The 8MP ultrawide and the Macro camera also are the best in this price bracket. I am exceptionally happy to upgrade from my old phone to this one, and I would recommend it to someone who is a causal gamer and wants a phone with a big battery, great display and awesome cameras. The hashtag used by Samsung #MegaMonster is truly apt for this phone.\n", '\nAmazing phone, smooth, feels more like i phone 11. Its battery takes a lot of tike to charge...but once charged alcan be used foreverOkay so, the phone is better than any other phone launched recentlyI guess its been some weeks since i have been using this but this monster feels just like  a brand new one.My suggestion is never put a screen guard or a tempered glass on the phone coz it lags the phone and touch response becomes really bad BUT..there s a setting for the screen guard users to increase sensitivity and it goes smooth againThe phone s brilliant and i love the performance and its very light in weight. The battery backup is cool and long lasting.I literally watched a 3 hour movie with just 16percent charge in phone..I suggest all the customers to buy a m31\n', "\nI am reviewing this after 1 week use of Samsung Galaxy M31.Design : Premium look and feel.Camera : M31 has best camera in its segment.

I'll rate 5/5.Battery : Battery is also exceptionally well that lasts upto 2 days with moderate usage. 5/5Processor : Till now it is running very smooth. seeing no lag so again will give 5/5.UI: Samsung provides customer friendly User Interface.

Display is super good. One main option its sound quality is good like in xaomi phone that I used it's on call hearing quality is super worst. In this phone the fingerprint and face unlock is little slow but it is ok. Its is light weight phone and its screen size makes it fully grip in hand.

But having issues in hearing some one talk from the other side or at times, the other person on the call cannot hear you. it is clear that the microphone are bad and not serving the purpose of a phone. When you play music, you can see that the volume of the song just fading off and at a point you just cannot hear any noise from the phone.When I try to return the phone its asking to install a smart check app and only if the app says there is some defect, they would take the phone back. If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one.And another point to note is that, I trusted that I would be happy with this phone, hence had purchased a special phone cover. now that money is also a waste.\n', "\nWell the Samsung Galaxy M31 is awesome phone. The 64 MP camera captures stunning  photos during day however you cannot zoom in 64 MP during capture. The camera quality is really awesome.

The huge 6000Mah battery is really Monster and last for 2 days for a normal user.

Besides a 6GB internal system storage and Android 10 OS gives you the feeling of a powerful machine in your hand.Plus you get the whole package of 6000mAh Battery, 6.4 super amoled display and cool design that gives you the feeling of a premium smart-phone.Well in nutshell, I can say this phone is a serious winner under the category of budget phone with all premium specifics and a sure thing to hang on to once you buy it.Happy to buy it from Amazon, super-fast, hassle free delivery.Word of Advice- Also buy a protective display glass and back cover to give your phone an ever-lasting long life.\n', "\nThe Best Ever Battery and Camera for limited budget..💥💥 Hope Samsung produces more new smartphones on this process with battery n camera ..

The 2nd Best Thing is the yr MP Camera is very much better to capture the pictures with Live Focus, Pro Mode, Night Mode , Food Mode, Slow Mo, Super Slow Mo and Hyperlapse. As it is mentioned M31 is a Fast Charging mobile, it takes almost 3 hrs to charge 100%. It should have alleast charged 100% within half an hr to 45 mins. Charging Time is the only backlog for M31.

But then again, at this price,  it's acceptable. The phone should have come with a cover cuz the metallic finish makes it slippery. The hardcover I ordered with it was of no use. I had exchanged my previous phone and got almost Rs. 5000 off  and I immediately regretted it as a lot of tools/in built functions do not exist in this phone. The only good thing which still is debatable is the battery I guess. I wish I had bought some other phone instead.\n", "\nThe camera quality is absolutely amazing to click landscape pictures and portraits.

The front camera gives u to ways to enhance Ur beauty like smoothening the face and making Ur eyes look bigger. The battery life is amazing as one time charging can last up to two days with Ur data or WiFi on the whole day. The fingerprint readability is very quick. Within a flash of seconds it reads Ur fingerprint even with Ur wet hands. Moreover the phone runs very smoothly even with lots of apps, documents and pictures. The screen is till the edge of the phone which gives a super hd quality to watch any videos with numerous editing options. Overall feature of the phone is superb and gives Excellent results. It's voice and mic are fabulous 😍 which records sounds with super quality\n", "\nUsing it for the last 4-5 days and here is what I feel about itLikes:The display is really good and considering other three important aspects, camera is really nice, as of battery for a regular use after charging it went on for nearly 2 days and Fingerprint reader response is fast. Doesn't heat up during regular use, haven't used for playing games so can't say much about that.Dislikes:The sound from the speaker is low, mobile feels a little heavy, so can't hold it for long. Missing the led notification light, I loved that feature from my last mobile phone(but it is also good, less distraction). Hearing a hissing sound during phone calls, still have to check whether it is a problem with the speaker or the network problem.\n", "\nI would suggest buying this to other customers as till now, it's been 3 months I have this phone, and I'm using this phone for gaming purpose each and everyday for at least 3hours per day, but still battery survives for around 48 hours. So no doubt battery is really good. But day by day it's getting weaker I think. While playing PUBG Mobile default settings, battery drains faster than other games and app.I have no complaints on display.Camera is not as good as expected from a 64MP primary camera, but that Slow Motion and other camera features are good and enjoyable.Processor is OKAY for me, as I do use HD graphics and Ultra framerate by default in PUBG Mobile, and it runs smooth. I'm not going to higher those graphics as I'm no professional gamer and and graphics looks smooth for me. For simple use and for free time gamers like me, think this phone is perfect.\n", '\nThe product is wisely good to use daily tasks run smoothly.. app transitions were smooth . No stuttering or legs.  Display takes it all..crisp and clear with viewing angles...too good. Was so amazed by the camera picture quality . Decent pics lowlight pics were good too. Only con is the phone gets lil hot just below the selfie cam..if used for more than 10 min or on call . One ui is decent way better than touchwiz. Bloatware can be removed or disabled. Over all good phone from Samsung gives tight competition to other phones in the same price bracket. Monster battery the name says it all..more than one day or close to 2 days it can last.. gaming is smooth with lil frame drops..\n', '\nIt\'s my 5th Samsung mobile since 2011.In the name Samsung means totally good .Especially want to mention which I newly boughtSamsung M31Reached my hand on 6th MarchFrom that day to till  today (7days) working verdygood."Fingure print"Working excellently some how faster."Camara QualityExcellent for photos but not up to the mark for video recording."Battery life"Samsung all phones Battery is good in this model 6000mah very special.From last 7 days I\'ve put charge 3 times only.For my continuous use for bellowPhone callWatsappEmailText msgPhoto scanInternet surfingYouTube videosComfortable for 2 days battery life."Face unlock"Very faster identification and response.\n', "\nFirst impressions - The super amoled screen quality is a bit oversaturated and the white looks a tad bit yellowish but can be worked with. The cameras are decent performers, not exceptional with the 64 mp and other lenses but not that bad also. Pictures are sharp and have less noise and good details in day light and somewhat decent even in artificial lighting. Performance is good and smooth for day to day work and the battery helps with that. Though it doesn't perform like a 6000 mah battery but still will get you over a full day. The charging takes around 2 and a half hours to go from 0 to 100. All in all its a pretty decent phone to use in 2020 and if you are just a normal user and want to use your phone for long periods of time without charging, then this is the one for you. I hope samsung provides regular updates so that this phone can be used for the next 2 to 3 years.\n", '\nPhone is great in budget, Display is truly amazing .if you are into movies and series on your phone its give good experience .Voice on speaker is low ,otherwise clarity is good.Down side is exynos dont get feeling as that we get in snapdragon.Not a gamer ,but I have tried hand on some and performance is averageBattery size claim  and performance is slight mismatch and with time and at time it feel like 4500 mph.Any ways overall good phoneBuild is good, feel is goodGet good backcover immediately or you can have fingerprints all on back of phone.\n', '\nWell had issue with battery charging just after one month call customer care they check online and arranged for return awesome way they help 🙏🏻And due to this I buy again the same phone as it’s have all you need every thing are just great 👌🏻\n', "\nI bought this phone for 3 reasons:- Awesome Screen- 2 Days Battery Life Yet Easy To Carry- Great Camera PerformanceI am happy to say that Samsung M31 delivers on all the above promises.What could have been better:- Newer chipset although I haven't seen any lag in any normal tasks thanks to the great optimization done by Samsung folks.- Battery charging time is a little high as the battery capacity is very hugh despite the 15W fast charging capacity.I think it would be too much to ask for anything else from a device this good at such an amazing price point.In short, if you want a device with an awesome screen, huge battery life and amazing camera - just go for the MegaMonster Samsung M31.\n", "\nThe phone has been doing good. The battery is alright, the camera is efficient. But just in span of 16 days of using it, the phone automatically restarted for like 4 times. Two of such times was like I had press the power key and lower volume key to switch it back on. Being a fairly good phone at this price there are certain drawbacks- this system restarting thing and the processor need to be better.Apart from that, it's a good phone with this budget.Take your time when you choose your handset, I was in a rush and needed urgently since the other option which I was considering a Moto phone wasn't deliverable at my address out of the lockdown effects.\n", "\nI got the delivery of phone on 6 March.When you first boot up the phone you will get update for February security patch.This phone comes with One Ui 2.0 & the first best part of is you can delete preloaded apps. This ui is more snappy & feels like a premium phone even though it's a midrange phone.Pros :-1) Super amoled display with L1 certification2) UI is more responsive & can be customizable as per our need which basically give a feel of stock android.3) Battery Backup is killer you can do the excessive task on this phone.4)Ram Management is on point.Cons :-1) Photos of night atmosphere are not good.2) Speaker of the phone is ok.3) Placement of headphone Jack.4) Slow Charging speed & length of the USB cable is too short.Though, Samsung gives good package of software's like Dolby atmos, MrOwl for unlimited cloud storage.\n", "\nI am using this phone almost for three months and it's performance is promising so far !Fingerprint sensor is very responsiveFace unlock knows how to do his job preety well !Gaming is upto the mark !Can play Asphalt 9 on highest level without any sweat!PUBG ?

But that's fixable by further software update so hope Samsung will fix that soon!Except that the device is Masterpiece in such a good price !\n", "\nSoftware isn't  as sturdy as needed, seems slower at most of the times.Camera is good, but not as good as claimed. Even 6/10 as claimed.Battery charges fast enough and gives good back up.Fingerprint sensor is ok only, while as face recognition isn't even ok.Overnight downloading stops by itself and you need to manually turn on/off the data to keep up the downloading. Checked all the settings but the issue persists.I guess, Phone's software needs some sort of upgrade and the phone will be perfect among all other phones of under 20k range.\n", "\nI think it is the best phone under 15000/- .Fingerprint sensor is fast and there is no issue about it. Camera quality is superb but i think if the camera's aperture were 1.7 then it will destroy every other company's smartphone in camera segment though it has very nice capacity to take very good pictures. The pics taken by it still so awesome. Atlast the battery life is very good. If someone wants to increase the battery life then they can use some tricks like blocking wifi scanning, blocking nearby device scanning , blocking bluetooth scanning,  using, dark mode, blocking unwanted notifications from the apps, using power saver mode, ultra data saver mode, and data saver mode. Then battery performance will be raise to the extreme.\n", "\nI've used this product for nearly 10 days and now I'll share its Pros and Cons.Pros1) It has a great battery life.2) The display is bright and rich in details.3) Camera is very good (But i would say one of the best in this price segment).4) Sound output is good.5) Overall design is good sleek and light weight.6) Samsung UI's user experince is easy and stutter free.Cons1) The phone seems to be a little slippery.2) Gets warm while playing heavy graphics games Pubg or pes ( was a bit disappointed). But it's Kay when you keep the settings under balanced or medium graphics. Not recommended for heavy gamers.3) Plastic body doesn't give a classy look.4) Charging speed is very slow (But you have to accept it for the bigger battery size).

I will give 100 out of 100\n", "\nIf you really want quality then you should go for it super amoled display is too beautiful to handle so that's why if you really really e looking for a product which has beauty E and quality and battery backup then you should really go for it however I like 5 inch smartphones screen I am bothered that's why Samsung has not made of phone of smaller display thank you friends\n", "\nAs the caption by the company tells, it's indeed a monster. Battery is a beast. Started at 30% and played 4 battle royale games. Battery drained only by 7%.Finger print sensor is highly responsive and even the face unlock feature.But camera requires but more stability. If you have an extremely stable hands while taking pictures, you'll definitely get masterpieces. But if your hand shakes, edges become a bit hazy. After all 64MP at this price range is unbelievable. So these small mistakes can be forgiven.\n", "\nWhy are some of the reviews mentioning poor camera etc? There is nothing much wrong with this phone. It is a good product and should be a smooth companion for an year at least.P.S> I don't play games on my phone.

This phones got one of the best displays in this price segment.. it's an awesome experience to watch movies and shows in this phone. And with the amazing battery backup of 6000mah we can watch shows continuosly for hours. The camera quality is also really awesome. I love everything about this phone except the charging speed.. it takes me around 3 hours to fully charge. I wish they would have added a much more faster charger instead of that 15W. Also sometimes the face unlock is bit slow or unresponsive. But as a whole i absolutely love this product.\n", '\nThe phone is really a mega monster and well worth the price. 128GB and 6GB RAM, 6000mAh battery along with a decent processor and camera is a steal at this price range. But my camera seems to have a problem where all the corners of the photo except a central circle become blurry and so i cannot take a whole picture of even a page. It might be a hardware problem in my device or it could be a software problem as well. Besides this issue the phone works great.\n', '\nSo I received this mobile on 16 march and started using it by 19 mar. Bought it to beat the looming lockdown at the time. Held me in good stead as I ran my office from this mobile only. Best part of mobile is its battery backup. With all the use I still get 24 hrs of backup. Camera quality was not my requirement but still I find it good. The touch screen and fingerprint are also great. Face recognition at times plays mischief, but its manageable.  At times it start blinks when moved from one app to the other but it may be more due to my own issue. Overall till now it has been a great experience.\n', '\nNice product within 16K, although when compared with other options available in market this might not be immediate choice but believe me you will not regret being an Owner of Samsung M31.Amazing quality of camera have already made me cameramen within my circle and a selfie geek, Battery is as promised, works whole day with just 50% with extensive use of GPS and WIFI and well as internet. What more can be asked for 16k when you are getting 128 GB and 6 GB memory with perfectly great fingerprint sensors and face lock.Only cons I found: Weight should have been a bit less and size is not very much comfortable with skinny pants.Overall, best handset in recent times and would always be looking for new models of Samsung within this price range. Good luck Samsung.\n', '\nAm only writing the cons:-1.) Front canera quality 5years backward..(its a quality with 12MP micromax camera instead of 32 MP)2.) HEATING ISSUE IS THERE... ALMOST UPPER ⅓ HEATS LIKE ANYTHING....( EXYNOS chipset is poorer, past experiences from many users..i personally rely for a Snapdragon chipset... )But This time i overestimated exynos & i fail...*Exynos is a samsung made chipset cheaply produced but most performed chipset are always with Snapdragon thus the phones they possess...Exynos 9611 used in..14k galaxy m31...24k galaxy a31 and goes on i donno what they mean by this.. unusual distribution...3.)

I have been using this phone for past 2 weeks and here are my feedbacks.Pros:Color of the phone is really cool and looks awesome.Loading of apps is fasterFront and Back camera is really good and output of the pictures are excellent during the day-light.Audio quality using headphones gives you a different experience altogether.Battery life lasts for 48-72 hours, if you are a regular user. If you are heavy user it should last some where between 23 to 36 hours.Cons:Pictures taken in night mode is decent.The phone gets slighted heated when you are using for a longer duration.\n', "\nBest Value for Money..

Moved from an Iphone 7 (poor signal reception, disappointing battery life). Super AMOLED display is very engaging, (reading books is comfortable, even in dim light) 6000 mAh battery, powerful camera (miss the OIS though). Only complaint is the processor, which can get overwhelmed at times. Keep in mind the form factor, this one can get quite large with a case on it. Most importantly, the SAR value is low (around 0.3 Head SAR).

Camera - the quad cam setup impresses more than one can expect, specially the 64 MP mode.3. The sAMOLED screen is blessing to the eyes. Brightness is no isssue even out in the sun.4.

I wanted to bring this point before the prospective buyers.Thanks.\n', "\nI bought one week back. The product is flawless. Build quality is good,amoled display make it equal to flagship version. Go for 64 GB if u already have SD card. If you already have Samsung phone you can easily transfer everything through samsung smart switch feature.Battery holds good if you don't use this phone as hotspot all the time.Touch sensors are good and speakers are fine.Do not have any complaints so far except keyboard input seems lags at time hopefully some updates in future fixes it.15k worth mobile n its worth it!!\n", '\nPerformance of fingerprint reader is very poor. Very very very clean fingers are required for the sensor to detect. Some time you need to try 4-5 times to get it detected. Many times it ended up with other unlock mechanism like pattern, password etc to get phone unlocked.\n', '\nSamsung Galaxy M31 Review RatingAfter 15 days of usage. The phone is a good option for budget buyers who want to stick to a band. The battery life is good but not excellent. Performance is okayish considering it has 6MB RAM. Camera is decent enough.

Amazing battery life, even after using Netflix + PUBG + Always on display for 5 hours, saw only 50% battery drain.2. Amoled screen has very good color saturation.3. Camera is good enough for my purposes, got decent night time pics.Caveats: 1. You have to select "natural" in the color saturation options, vivid is quite extreme2. The default camera setting is 16 MP. You need to explicitly select 64MP as an aspect ratio (?!!) in the camera settings.\n', '\ni am getting good display experience in using this mobile like i never used such a good display.but some timeskeypad got stuck and i just purchased it 10 days agoonce some error occured due to keypad only and it abruptly restarted.

I disappointed so much.-15W charger is given for 6000mah. Its take 2:30 mins for 100percent.-temperglass and transparent case or headset is not given.-HDR support is not good for pubg  and it's not good for pro players.I bought this mobile and used for 3days. 😃\n", "\nAm unable to use internet and pages are loading slower. I saw similar issues reported for M31 in Samsung community website.My family members are having same network inserted in different mobile works really good.

A very very very heavy usage needed to drain its battery in one day.Monster performance ,good biometrics (both fp and fd) and a beautiful yet lightweight design makes this phone a worth buying at this price. Love it.\n", '\nOverall the product is ok. What I did not like about the product:1) Fast charger: It is just 15W. Although when you plug-in it says "Fast charging" it still takes approx 3.5-4 hours to fully charge. Too slow in my opinion.2) Some of the preloaded apps from Samsung are very annoying. Specially the camera app has one very bad feature. After you record a video and want to see it, it starts playing automatically. If you want to scrool forward, backward, pause etc, there is no control. It has to open the video again using a different app and then you can control. Such an annoying thing.\n', "\nMega monster the correct  name for such a great mobile phone with great specification.

Sluggish in multitasking even in 6gbOverall its a nice package at this price range\n', "\nGalaxy M31's camera sure lives up to my expectations. The picture quality in low light is awesome and the phone is comparatively light given the battery capacity. It took around 2.5 hours for a full charge and lasted for roughly 1.5 day on my normal usage. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the lack of IR blaster and One UI. One UI doesn't have out of the box support for things like internet speed meter and number of fingerprints that can be registered is limited to 3. Overall it's a good purchase within given price, especially if you're a camera fanatic.\n", "\nPreviously I had used C9 Pro compared to that M31 was little bit fast and the battery backup was too good. Both front and back camera quality was superb. Im using this m31 mobile for more than a month and usage of mobile is high, like i would use mobile around 15 hrs in a day(most of time i use it for browsing) after that I will put the mobile in charging overnight (1 time in a day). While i put it on charge in day time i have observed it was getting charged to 15% to 100% with in 2hrs for a 6000 mah monstere battery.

It has very good features and I love the physical design of the mobile. It looks really modern and of high quality because of which someone might think that it is an expensive phone but instead it's really affordable costing just 15,999. This phone provides all the best features in just a single place including camera of 64 megapixels rear camera which is not available at this price by other brands. The battery capacity is amazing, 6000 MAH...a luxury for me again. And many more features that you can find in detail on Amazon mobiles category.It's worth a purchase!I highly refer this phone to others !Thanks.\n", '\nFront cam is bad. Finger print scanner and backpanel has a slight gap which gathers dust around it. Face unlock and fingerprint lock is a bit slow though. Battery works okay. If backpanel was also made of gorilla glass it would be better as it gets dusty and greasy every time u use it. phone is heavy. Back Cam doesnt look even close to 64 mp. The so called front screen broke after falling from a very small height and there is no backcover available and even repair shops dont have its spare parts\n', "\nAfter using this phone for 2 month & more, I am giving this review ( a short review) after viewing this you can really impress with this phone,my observations are:1.everyone is looking for such a phone with a very good camera quality,in this phone with 64 MP camera the images are really appreciable.2. Now I come to its battery it has 6000 mah of battery life,which lasts a long ,in my recent days I watch movies,playing games but it doesn't last.3. Now about its look, very attractive especially it's back with superb camera design .I impressed.4. With the given processor it doest create any hindrance while using any heavy size gaming app.So I want to say as I experienced, it is really very impressive with this budget.\n", '\nFirstly, I am very glad to inform you that "Samsung M31" is the first smart phone in my life. Currently I am using feature phone \'Samsung Guru 1200\' which was purchased around 5 years ago. When I decided to go for a smart phone, it didn’t need to think much about which brand I would choose. I Zen percent believe that I made the best choice. Because I am already well experienced about the quality, battery life etc... of the Samsung company. I got my phone last week, but I didn\'t started to use it yet because of its cuteness. Thank you Samsung for presenting such a best phone satisfying all features at affordable price for a middle class person like me. Thank you so much….\n', "\nThe camera of this phone is really nice.The display of this mobile is also very good. I recommend this mobile to everyone who is in search of a phone with a good camera.The weight of this phone is also quite low. The only thing which did not meet expectations is the battery. Even though it states that it has a 6000mAh battery , it doesn't last for too long.\n", "\nThere is a fake rumour which is spread by youtubers and reviewers in d market.There is this notion that it EXYNOS 9611 is laggy, wifi reception is not good, battery is not 6000, camera quality  is better than MI note 8 pro...etc..But it's not.Camera's image processing  is lot more efficient than the 8 pro's MEDIATEK HELIO G90T which is d most powerful  processor. Night images are also good.Wifi and cellular network reception is also as better than expected. It may show one or two bars less but there is no compromise in the call quality.Personally  I like the phone very much.

Ram management is excellent.Camera - This is my least favourite part. Takes reliable photos in all cases. 4 cameras on rear is exaggerated. Real world applications are really low. Video quality is good.\n', "\nAs a mountain  guide I always go for  a phone  with  a big batteries, since  there  is limited  chance to find  wall sockets.

It has good camera quality when you take photos in good lighting. And the night mode is above the average. Sound quality, I found it to be very good in all the aspect. Display, very good quality.

By the way I didn't check if it really takes 2.5 Hr to charge up. I just go by the reviews which claims the same.And finally that one thing which has disappointed me is that this model don't have inbuilt music player.\n", "\n* Nice Display* Good battery backup* Nice Camera* handy* Perfect for users who use their phone for calling, navigation , taking photos and all daily needed apps.Below are few things I have observed so far.- Taking time to get it's battery fully charged.  6000mAH battery  could  be the reason it.- Not getting  a perfect screen gaurd so far.

Battery charging time is more even though claimed to be fast charging. There are very many options as double tap sleep which is not available here, whereas in similar price range phones we get lot of options/features. One important thing is the charger cable length is too short, not up to the standards of Samsung. Samsung - if you are unable to provide decent features/options in this price range, please don't roll out mobiles here and downgrade your standard.\n", "\nIf display and battery is what you demand from your phone with a pretty decent camera you can go for Samsung M31. If you are into lot of games and stuffs and you go on for hours playing PUBG and other heavy games then this device might be a nightmare for you.

The saturation on these pictures is quite high, often leaving a slightly yellow tinge.The biggest problem with this phone however, is that the phone automatically switches off and doesn\'t switch back on for at least 8-10 minutes. This isn\'t due to an uncharged battery, or a draining battery, as the phone would be at full charge when this issue occurs. And upon the restarting of the phone, the battery power remains at the same percentage it was at when the phone switched off.

I think the time period which I used is enough to make conclusion about battery and coming to screen resolution, camera quality, sound quality, performance, browsing efficiency.. everything was good till now.. the only thing I miss was earphones and protective case.. it would be very appreciative if Samsung provides earphones and protective case like how vivo is providing.. other than that no issues..

Not worth a single rating as the pictures are distorted when taken at night.64MP (no zoom ) fails in comparison to a 16MP cam quality ....the picture taken are sharp and blurred when zoomed.The only good thing is fast charging and battery life.

Because of this unable to play games.\n', '\nDefinitely a value for money buy!! Can\'t get better screen at this price point. Humungous Battery size helps in 1+ day with a single  charge.Have always preferred Samsung over other "cost effective" brands. Still couple os things that Samsung could have added to make it a killer proposition:1. 25W charger with fast charging. Sorry Samsung, 15W charger take >2 hrs to charge. That\'s not fast in these times.2. Have been a fan of Samsung Pay. If it can be introduces to M series as well, even if needs some hardware it will be a great addition.\n', '\nOverall, good phone in its price bracket. Stand out features would be Super Amoled screen and massive battery which lasts day and a half with more than normal use. Samsung brand backing is an added advantage. Camera performance is very good in proper lighting conditions. No lag noticed even after loading bunch of apps. It would be interesting to see if it can give same performance after 6 months of usage.Final verdict: Go for it if you are not an heavy gamer and high quality basic requirements (screen, camera, battery) in limited budget are your priority.

Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment.

Still now I don't know why it keeps on doing like this again and again. I am facing this issue of shutting down automatically and booting takes too long for more than 5/6 times.Face recognition is also not speedily work.I can tell the display is superb and the rest goes well enough.\n"]
