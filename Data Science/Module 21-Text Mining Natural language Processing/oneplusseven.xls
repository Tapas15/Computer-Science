Later fingerprint sensor was responding... I have to use the phone pin to unblock.Even visited the service center in Banjara Hills, And they told me to recreate the scene, Due to heat I have switch off the device, Fear of It might explode. Later they said to use for another day and visit again.

Performance is top notch till date & now same device getting sold at 10k discount, so it\'s good buy.----------------------------Planning to buy OnePlus 7 Pro? Here\'s all in one review:Bought OnePlus 7 Pro in first sale, now using it from few days.Yeah! OnePlus 7 Pro priced little high.PRO\'S:- OnePlus 7 Pro\'s DISPLAY looks damn beautiful üòç with 6.67 inch OLED fluid Amoled 1440p display which has 90 Hz refresh rate.- It comes with pre-applied screen protector.- In display fingerprint sensor is faster than OnePlus 6T.- Warp charger charges very fast, from 0-50 in just 20 minutes.- In Fanatic mode, games can be played butter smooth.- Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.- Cam2api enabled.- Snapdragon 855 gives best performance.- Oxygen OS is BEAST, smooth, bloatware & ad-free, lag free.- UFS 3.0 helps to improve performance.CON\'S:- Though, display looks beautiful with 90 Hz refresh rate, but because of that battery drains much faster, as result give Screen on time 4-5 hours. You can change it to 60 Hz to save battery.- Overpriced.- Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can\'t even focus on near objects.- Device is heavy.- No IP rating, but according to few, it survives in water as well, but not tested personally üòõ.- No wireless charging.- No headphone.FINAL VERDICT:- If OnePlus 7 Pro satisfies your requirement, buy it though it\'s little bit overpriced but still worth it.- If not 7 Pro, Samsung S10+ is also great choice.- Otherwise, if looking for low price phone, Flagship Killer 2.0 coming soon üòúNote: I\'ll update review, after using for few days.\n', "\n\xa0On the first day I am facing issue in setting and it's not opening having issue in WiFi connectivity...any more issue...\n", '\nGood phone. But after paying 52k we expect least a headphones. Ggwp OnePlus. On YouTube while unboxing. They get Bluetooth headphones, car charger, 3 different covers. Really disappointed when I found no headphone in 7pro 8gb RAM 256gb ROM\n', '\nFirst of all i am a die hard fan of one plus.I have one plus 5t one plus 6t and now a one plus 7 pro.Seriously very disappointed with the camera.Before one plus i was a mi fan.I have redmi note 3 and note 7.Selfie camera comparison of op 7 n redmi note 7.Redmi note 7 selfie camera is for better than op 7 pro.Op7 pro selfie camera shows ur face like a skin disease patient.Where as op5t and op6t had no issues like this.For this price range op should have included wireless charging.Waiting for a better camera update.\n', '\nI generally use Apple iphone but this time I tried something different. I completely disappointed by using Oneplus 7 pro camera .iPhone 6 camera is more better than this. OIS and EIS is not working properly. There are so many UI issues as well in Oxygen OS.Phone is quite Bulky and not able to handle by using single hand. I wasted 53k to buy this phone. I never buy any product of OnePlus in future.\n', "\nWhat a gem of a smart device! Absolutely incredible.Bit heavy, and SD 855 keeps rolling as it reduces battery drainage unbelievably, i didn't expect that.And look at the price, Oh ho man...! it helps us saving atleast 20k, you know what i mean...üòâ\n", "\nHeating as hell, poor battery backup. Camera is not good. And it's heavy. Don't feel effect of Dolby Atmos.Pro- just it's screen.I will update after further usage.Update after 1 week, heating issue gone. Facing WhatsApp and YouTube application's frequent crash. Camera quality is still an issue, it's good but not up to the mark of flagship.Update- pro-1. fingerprint sensor + face unlock is fast.2. night camera is really good3. video recording is stable.con-1. During calls there is a whistling sound.2. sometimes touch is not working properly in whatsapp,vlc, youtube, asphalt 8 etc.3. selfie camera is not upto mark4. phone is hanging after first update.\n", "\nI have been using this phone for about last 4 days and the best part about this phone is the display it's truly gorgeous once you start using 1440P 90Hz display I bet you won't even feel using the 1080p display and the cherry on the top is its OLED black is black and all the colours looks just so great that it makes viewing experience like you are sitting in a IMAX.Alright enough about the display now speaking about the camera I think over the updates oneplus will improve it but still as of today it's still performs quite well in well lit environment but it underperfoms in low light environment however nightscape mode works quite well but I hope for the oneplus improvvs it over the updates.Under producing selfie camera performs well and I really like that it has a free fall detection which is like and insurance for your phoneSpeaking about the battery if you're going to game then I guess you will get around 4 hours of screen on time on 1440 p at 90 hz but if you are going to use this phone as a daily driver then it can get you through all the day I charge my phone at 7 in the morning and when I came back home at around 12 o'clock at the night I still had around 20% battery left so it's quite good for me.Other Interesting features like the processor of this phone the beauty of this phone and the glass back and its display is just Cherry on the top.In conclusion this is by far the best phone I have ever bought if you are going to buy any phone at around 50k price. Then definitely go for this and I think 8GB RAM variant is good enough I don't know why they made 12 GB variant\n", "\nFirst time I have purchased one plus phone (one plus 7 pro) but my experience is very bad due to phone camera quality and battery life. Pictures are blur and camera can't focus on subject, pictures showing good in camera before clicking but after click picture goes blur. I have done every troubleshooting but problem is still same. Battery also work for 4-5 hours. So I want to return it. Because I have spent a very big amount on this phone but I am very disappointed by Amazon and one plus.\n", "\nOne plus 7 pro is sold at a higher price and the device doesn't justify that, with no headphone jack and a dismal battey life i would suggest to wait for one plus 7. They don't include type - c to 3.5 jack connector in the box. WHEN I SAY THAT BATTERY LIFE IS POOR I SERIOUSLY MEAN IT. you barely get 4 hrs on time with the screen with 90hz, they have included 60hz option in the settings but which fool would change from 90 to 60hz ? the 90hz will spoil you and you will NEVER go back to 60hz screen. As i said the mobile overall is average not bad. They have provided a WARP charger which charges like crazy fast which will somehow 'compensate' a bad battery ?  NO  There were numerous occasions where i had to charge 3-4 times a day of heavy usage. The WARP charger charges the device to 50% in 20 min which is the only reason why i haven't gone for refund, really.As for the camera, it's 'average' for a flagship device. One plus pro are a premium rage smartphones which aims to compete with flagships, it isn't a 'flagship killer' but a 'flagship contender'The photos on bright sunlight and good lighting are good but fally horribly bad on low lighting and night time. So dismal.Some neat features in this device is that it is really smart , the sensors are top notch and detect the phone movement so scarily accurate . For example when you life the device from the table or a bed or whatever the sensors detect the movement and the screen lights up for you to check for notifications, note that this isn't because the front cam detects your 'ugly' face because the front cam is neatly sealed inside the device and it pops up when you need to take a selfie or a face recognition unlock with help of a magnetic motor. The device's screen is good not great i don't understand why there is a huge fuss around it.One more thing i have noted is that the vibrating motor in this device is very top class, they have clearly put a lot of effort in perfecting it, you can set the vibration intensity to match you satisfaction, be careful though if it is too high, when the mobile vibrates you too vibrate along with it :)I , thus conclude by stating that this device is a very 'average' 'smart' phone with a good screen which also happends to be a flagship for one plus company.\n", "\nVery bad product, many functions doesn't work, I have OnePlus 5 and I didn't feel any issue with my old phone till now, don't buy, you will regret, and also Amazon support won't help you at all, they are even more worst üò°üò°üò°\n", "\nOne of the best phones I have used, be it android or iOS.The performance is buttery smooth, compared side by side with a Oneplus 6T, and 90hz display really makes a hell lot of difference.Updated to the 9.5.4 available while writing the review, and the battery life is awesome, getting 6 hrs screen on time with 90hz display. Camera is decent, just put the GCam, and it becomes a versatile camera option to shoot in different scenarios.Warp charging is the highlight and really charges the phone pretty quick, I don't miss my dash charging even with this huge battery.The haptic motor is finally really good, and now typing and other small tasks gives that satisfying vibrations.Stereo speakers are of really good quality and they are loud and clear.As for the headphone jack and adapter, everyone should know that before getting this device, spending ‚Çπ50k for a device without prior research is your mistake. Sure they should have given atleast an adapter, but it's no reason to give this one star.Overall, really awesome device, much better than the exynos galaxy that we get here in India.\n", '\nI am very disappointed with one plus there are no wireless charging and earphones with the phone in 53k u must go with 26k-55k vivo Samsung or apple also they giving you this standard Assesories with the phone.about hand set phone screen resolution is perfect üëåcamera is perfect and design also perfect üëå\n', "\nBad experience with Amazon and onepluse.I have problems in touch but they don't accept replace immediately.Touch not working properly in a day 2_3 times it's automatically touch and phone start various application without any touch closing and open. Customer care taking too long time and assign technical assistance after on 27  may . Don't buySame problem after replacement but now ok after os update. Best phone in 50k range\n", "\nBefore going to buy this product let me tell some truth... Camera is at it's worst, after buying this  phone  I got 2 updates and last one specific for camera  but still it's same as before after updateScreen quality  just like a normal lcd panel phone , I switched from pixel XL but that was my biggest mistake I can say that.Now the funniest thing is my phone's front camera taking 15-20 second to popup and Amazon tech support says that's normal üòÅüòÅ. Amazon says no return policy is there for this phone so yeah you are going to regret after buying this piece of junk, don't listen to the YouTubbers they are just paid for that. I am writing this review after 10 days of use.\n", "\nThe product was received in good packaging condition.. The phone is awesome except that the selfie popup camera isn't working.. It refuses to come out & instead an error message pops up for the camera..\n", "\nPhone is like a brick. Very heavy. I mean you can't talk without headphones. Interesting thing is one plus calling this premium phone. They have the audacity to give this phone without earphone and any kind of adapter from type c to 3.55. Thats arrogance at it's best. Basically you are stuck and spend whole lot of money for Bluetooth ear phone. Only saving grace of this phone is performance. Ui is not great and very old. Vivo has better ui than this phone. Buy if you want to shell out extra money for simple things like adapter and all.  It is not water resistant too. No it's rating. This is my first and last one plus.\n", "\nAn absolute fun loving futuristic Beast phone ever made by OnePlus.Thumbs Upüëç:1.

I disappointed a bit by not having a 3.5 mm ear phone jack. Coming to the story of battery life one plus 7 pro is 4000 milliamp which is having 9 hrs 45 minutes battery life where as one plus 6t is 3700 milliamp which is having 10 hrs battery life . I was disappointed with this too. I was totally stunned by the speediness of fingerprint sensor absolutely stunned .  I think everything is fine with the New one plus 7 pro and I am absolutely and delightfully enjoying the experience of New one plus 7 pro . Basically I am a movie lover. I am enjoying the HD movies like I am watching in movie theater. Dolby Atmos sound quality adds this phone to become high priority than others .\n', "\nDefinitely worth every single Penny spent on it. The display and performance are absolutely mind blowing. Camera may not be the best but it's still top class. The phone isn't as big as people would think it is. It's actually pretty sleek and feels nice in the hands as it isn't very broad. The battery performance is commendable given the 90hz refresh rate and the QHD display. Would easily last a day on normal usage. Although, Heavy users would require around half an hour of charging. Warp charge is super fast, you won't even realise how quickly your phone charges after you plug it in. Oxygen works buttery smooth and as a first time user of this UI, I'm liking it quite a lot. Gaming is wonderful too, absolutely smooth, beautiful and lag free. The accompanying phone cover is good too, it just gets smudged by finger prints though. As someone who watched reviews of different phones and was well versed with what I was buying, I'm enjoying every second of using this phone.Most of the reviewers here are complaining about not receiving headphones and extra covers and a screen guard with bubbles, it's absolutely absurd. You should atleast look over what you're buying first thoroughly, and any reasonable man would have easily found out what he's get in the box and what he's not getting. These illiterate people buy stuff without knowing anything and then expect candies in the damn box and when they don't get it, write negative reviews which influence other queer buyers. It's highly unfortunate.For all those looking for the best performing Device available right now, go for it, if you can compromise with the headphone jack (get a 3.5mm to c type cable and problem solved). Everything from the looks and feel to the performance of the phone is amazing. You'll feel that you're holding a flagship masterpiece every second you're holding this phone. It's easily the best phone in it's price range hands down.\n", "\nBattery is a weak.. Needs to charge twice a dayAnd apps also keep crashing... In between...Thr is a bug in which lock screen ambient light won't work sumtimes\n", "\nDidn't received Bluetooth headphone and car charger with mobile.

Go for google pixel rather than this.\n", "\nI didn't believe the reviewers. I bought the phone. And now I don't like any other phones except OnePlus 7 Pro.90Hz - It's madness. Imagine this - Drinking alcohol is injurious to health, but if you drink it you'll feel good. Right? 90Hz would give you the best smartphone experience, but it drains some more battery compared to 60Hz. Moderate drinking is perfectly fine; charging the phone 2 times a day is fine too. (I'm a heavy user)Warp charger - Charges the phone at remarkable speeds. If you're a previous OnePlus user, you won't find much of a difference.Camera - Definitely the best, in accordance with pricing.Everything else - as accurate as in the product description.My favorite retarded reviews :*Someone was upset that he couldn't find a 'OnePlus backpack' and a 'OnePlus water bottle' in the package.*Someone was upset that he found an air bubble under the phone's screen guard.\n", '\nI was a follower of OnePlus but after this phone I am not going to by OnePlus phones anymore.

You can bet on it. The Samsung S series like curves at vertical edges of 6.67" large screen and no bezels gives the phone very rich looks. By far the best OnePlus till date.The 4000 mAH battery lasts throughout the day with more than average screen time but the charging is again super quick (30 to 100% in less than 20 mins)Using gestures feels awesome and gives more screen space on already a very large screen.Camera is still under testing so no comments, however initial pictures looks very good.So for a new phone I rate it 5.

There are many Indian you tuber spreading negative reviews of this phone but I tell you if you really wanna decide by review then watch out side Indian you tuber videoes.

Transforming from IOs to Android was a cakewalk for me thanks to my OnePlus 3T. Even today after almost 3 years of its use I saw no lag issues, no issues with the battery and instant rapid charging which was the really the most important plus point for me.This Version of OnePlus is surely a masterpiece. Be it the speed, the battery backup, rapid WARP charging, Be it the huge screen and yes the premium look makes it a worth buy. It's been 2 days I own it and everyone who looks at it is amazed to see how perfectly everything is compiled to make this masterpiece. The camera is amazing with three modes as described during the launch with an amazing picture quality.  The music with stereo sound and Dolby Atmos  makes it so much full of life..

The speed, options, video quality and ease of access all leaves you feeling royal.But in addition I loved Amazon service. I had exchanged my old phone for this and it was such a breeze.

It's just 24 hrs since I first ordered the phone on Amazon and it's already set up and working as usual.\n", "\nThis is by far the best Oneplus device to be launched till date. I never had a oneplus device before. After using it for a week I came across these observations :Battery life is superb, and warp charge really packs a punch. Does 45% charge in around 15-18 minutes.Fingerprint reader is lightning fast.Rear cameras will make you forget Dslr. Low light photographers can will find this amazing. Front camera is perfect. The device is a little heavy but flaws are less when compared to other advantages. 90hz refresh rate is a boon. Actually you have to get a hands on experience as words will fall short for this beast. There is no question of lag. PUBG and other games are smooth and well the graphics is on another level with the gaming mode setting. The fluid AMOLED screen is pure joy. There is no audio jack but that's wierd  but if you can shell out 50k for a premium device then you can afford to shell out few extra bucks for a Bluetooth headset. Still going through the device features as everyday I am coming across new features which is really cool. Mirror grey looks better those who can't buy the nebula blue, go for mirror grey, you won't be disappointed.Overall the device is a beast. Go for it.\n", "\nFriends ordered this phone and received in just 2 days time. Very much happy with the purchase. Heard a lot of negative complaints like camera, phantom touch, slow fingerprint etc. Which phone haven't has that. But this one really lived up to my expectations. The issues with this phone will definitely go away with updates, I received the first update and there is development in camera quality. I haven't had any experience of phantom touch and poor fingerprint yet. The display is very punchy and accurate. OnePlus development team is very active and will provide all updates to optimise this phone..so go for it.\n", "\nOne plus put a lot of effort while designing the phone itself it's a beautiful peice of technology. Feels premium! The screen is just irresistible it's just wow. With QuadHD panel with 90hz refresh rate it's the best in the market now. One plus did well with the cameras this time. The main sensor the 48MP one is good after the update. But the wide angle suffers a bit in low light plus 3x zoom lens performance lies between the main sensor and wide angle. The portrait comes great out of the device. The selfie cam is good but seems to get harder on face in WhatsApp cam. The battery backup is okay considering the fact the phone has qhd screen with 90hz refresh rate. Yes we can change that for sure. The haptic feedback is just wow much better that previous models. The finger print reader is fast sometimes inaccurate but yes it's good. Oxygen OS doesn't need any explanation it's just buttery smooth. Thanks to the SD 855 and 8GB ram on my phone plus the UFS 3.0 storage throw any app on the device it will hadle it without a sweat multitasking is top notch on this set. But seriously one plus just had me on the screen and design....!\n", '\nVery good and excellent using From past two days received on 17th of may , no issues with phone battery backup Good no heating, refresh rate too fastValue for MoneyPop up Selfie Camera is Great.Battery Life is Pretty Good.Music Sound System is Very Good.Inprint Finger sensor is Fast and good to unlock the phone\n', "\nReally an amazing phone.You will fall for the screen itself.Bought on amazon prime sale on 16th and got it on 17th. Super fast delivery by amazon. kudos.Coming it the phone, it came with the pre-applied screen protector and a transparent case. That's a good welcome gesture. This is my first OnePlus phone coming from a stock android phone. The OOS is clutter free and experience is pure smooth with 90Hz and QHD+ resolution. With that in mind, the SOT of the phone with full brightness will  hardly reach 5 Hours. I use this preset in home as, thanks to warp charge, which charges in 1 Hr 10 min from 0 %. And when I go to office or any other, I use the FHD+ and 60Hz preset to get almost ~8 hours SOT with medium to high brightness.Basically this is a gaming phone. So you can play PUBG with no lag at all, also maxed out settings in Call of Duty Mobile.Camera quality is very promising. I used Gcam to get almost as good as pixel like shots. Day light shots in stock cam is better than GCam. Except for the consistency across the cameras. I hope OP will fix this issue with an update.Finally I would say that, this mobile is totally worth it for the price you pay.\n", "\nI have been waiting for nebula blue color and it's worth waiting. I have bought one plus 7 pro. I have been using one plus 5 and upgrade it to one plus 7 pro. Phone's first impression is best. It's really a big phone. If you are using big phone even though you feel it's bigger. Screen is curved and glass body looks cool. Op7 pro comes with inbuilt fingerprint reader and it's quite fast. I have also taken many pictures and all the photos are just perfect. I have also played pubg and it's run really pretty well. But I am still waiting for the day when one plus roll out update so we can also played pubg @ 90 FPS. Battery life is good. Only thing I missed is 3.5 mm Jack for headphones. Other than that all the things really cool and perfect.üëå I must say if you are a heavy mobile user, or if you want to use a best Android phone or if you love to play game than this phone is for you.

I am now thoroughly familiar with its functions, and we get along well. The battery has stabilised, and I get 25 to 30 hours easily with around 9 hours on screen. The phone lights up on its perimeter when in lock mode and you get a notification - different colours for different apps. I have given it full marks now as it has surpassed my expectations. I thoroughly recommend this phone and consider it to be great value for money! Please hit like if you found my review helpful and let me know in the comments your experience with this phone.___This is a preliminary review after one day's usage and exploration. It will tell you how I feel about the phone and how I perceive it when comparing it with other phones I have owned. Please remember that every person is looking for different things in a mobile phone so your user experience will be different from mine.My wishlist included honest photography and videography with a clear yet deep sound, long battery life and a front fingerprint reader. I take lots of pictures and hate the overexposed, oversaturated and beautified images that have taken over the market, hence the need for honesty. I had a few phones in mind and kept watching videos trying to figure out which one would suit me best before ordering the One+ 7 Pro. The reason? The photo tests came really close to those of Google Pixel 3 and sometimes surpassed them!So here are some observations I noted down as I got to grips with my new phone:Comes with silicone case but no earphones or adaptor. Guess they expect us to have leftover earphones and adaptors from previous phones?It's large and heavy! Consequently, it gets cumbersome and causes muscle fatigue after a while (had a similar problem with Sony XZ3). I preferred the feel of the Mate 20 Pro as it was slightly slimmer and fitted better and also it was beautifully balanced, so you did not need to exert yourself to hold it. [My hand has gotten used to its weight, but I still feel a bit intimidated by its size and wonder whether we do indeed need such big screens. However, watching Netflix in bed demonstrated the beauty of its large display and the clarity of its sound.]The fingerprint reader works well and fast. Facial recognition is also speedy, but as it requires the recessed camera to work, I am not too keen on using it.Photographs were a bit noisy on portraits but looked artistic. The update fixed the noise issue BUT ruined the portrait mode that is now overexposed. Not sure why; still figuring it out. Need to test it further. The rear camera produced good photographs compared to the Mate 20 Pro, which was a fail. The S7 has more depth of colour, and a nice background separation which gives photos a 3D appearance, something the Mate lacked and the 7 Pro cannot quite achieve. (The S7 was a dynamite phone despite the skin smoothing.) [It was my stupidity. I thought like a Galaxy S7 user that if I click on the face of the person, I'd get an AF lock, but this phone has no AF lock. What it does when you click on the part of the screen is giving you the option to adjust the exposure (light or dark), so I ended up with a washed-out picture - my fault entirely! Also, in portrait mode, it has a little oblong shape that says Depth Effect. This is what controls the bokeh, and you can't do much about it other than make sure it lights up green before snapping the shot. It will light up green only when the camera is at the correct distance from the person. I suppose this is one way of making sure the subject is in proper focus. Talking of the bokeh effect, it is very subtle, unlike other phones. If you want stronger effects, photo manipulation programmes are your friend, but for me, this is good enough.]Videos on the One+ 7 Pro are beautifully stable when walking, but if you turn fast, the image blurs momentarily before it recovers. [I enjoyed using slow motion but not sure if other phones can switch to slow motion during videoing or if the YouTuber vloggers actually splice videos up to add the slow motion part. My phone can take either or videos. The slow-motion does not activate randomly as in the Samsung phones, and I think that gives you more control but, to be honest, I am still a rookie in these things.]Sound playback is excellent in music and films due to the top and bottom speakers, but the microphone can hardly pick up someone talking 1.5 meters away from you in a quiet room when you are taking a video.The display is not as great as any of the comparison phones. The icons (phone, texts, camera, etc.) are not as beautiful as the competition's. There is a poor selection of wallpapers and none of the themes. One thing I enjoyed about the Mate 20 Pro was its wide selection of wallpapers, some of which were animated. Felt so excited to hold a phone that had falling cherry blossoms. Luckily, the Play Store has a variety of free wallpapers and was able to find some that give me joy. [Once a great wallpaper was in situ, everything looked much better!]The curved edge makes the letters from some apps seem to slide downhill, reminds me of Salvador Dali's famous melting paintings. Not a deal-breaker but distracting. App developers and One+ should take that into consideration and condense their displays to leave a black gap on the edges when text is involved. [My brain learned to ignore it.]The bottom navigation bar lies behind ads in games like Solitaire - takes some skill to NOT click on the ad trying to get to the home screen, and I am proud that I have mastered it. [Should not be a problem if you are not using the silicon case. If you do have the case on as I do, learn to start the scrolling action from the silicon itself, and you won't miss.]Angry Birds Friends is not loading and constantly crashing. [Uninstalled the app as per Rovio's instructions and re-installed it. It worked until I exited. Then I was again unable to load it. This morning, it works again. Mystery!]Bejewelled Blitz was jumpy despite the 90 Hz refresh rate, and it feels laggy. Taking off the Fnatic mode seemed to improve things a bit (though Fnatic is meant to be ideal for gaming...) [Checked this morning, still laggy at 60 Hz even if all other games are closed. I can understand the screen being slow because of the screen protector causing more friction, but why is the game slow to load results? Maybe my broadband is slow at times?]Colours on apps seem ‚Äòdirty‚Äô instead of bright and vibrant as in comparison phones. Also, blacks look greyed out. [I got used to the new look of colours, and it does not bother me any more. I have even reduced the display settings to save battery as that is more important to me at the moment.]Google Calendar is more laborious to work with than the Samsung calendar as it requires to select what kind of entry you are entering - ugh! (Ease off, Google. Just let me enter it and trust me to know what my entry is for!!)Step counter kept counting up despite me not taking a single step. It just felt the vibrations of me picking the phone up and thought this was walking. Hmm... to cheat or not to cheat? [I don't really fancy walking around with this big phone, so I have left my old phone in the bathroom LOL]I did not use the file transfer app they recommend as I had a bad experience with Huawei's own and never said again. Sadly restoring from Google backup, did not restore my text messages. The other phones did, which is baffling. [Apparently, Google security does not allow a full restore unless you verify it is you who logged in from a new device, so do that first and then try the restore.]The keyboard is more accurate than the Samsung one, probably due to space, but it makes it more tedious to type as you need to move your finger further. However, it has a great feature: a proper keypad that can be activated entering a series of numbers. On the minus side, the special characters are slightly harder to get to.The final observation is that the battery seems to drain fast (very steep slope in the diagram). The battery charges fully in 1 hour 20', and despite predictions that the phone would only last till 3 am, the phone survived the night on standby mode till 6 am. Although the screen was on for about 6 hours yesterday, I didn't do much other than set it up, take a few pics and a couple of short videos and try out my game apps. The Mate 20 Pro had an amazing battery life. [The battery continues to worry me. If I need to be charging it more than once a day, then I have gained nothing over my old phone. I have now put the phone on a dark theme, reduced the Hz from 90 to 60 and lowered the resolution. I also make a point to close every app when I am not using it. I am now confident enough to say that if there is a deal-breaker for me, it will be battery life; however, apart from the 6T, most phones have worse battery life. The Mate 20 has a great battery, but the photography is ... ugh! I will try to let the battery drain and then charge it early morning and see how it fares. With light use, I would have expected the battery to last more than 23 hours :( Imagine if I start using it exclusively as I did with my S7!]Conclusion: I am not 100% convinced this phone is for me though I can learn to live with it. I know from reviews that the One+ 6T has much better battery life and photography so maybe that would be an option...? [I am so tempted to order it and compare!!!]I have just uploaded a screenshot of the battery information. It has improved. The phone goes into panic mode at 15%, but if you ignore its message, it will see you through the night on standby and give you a couple of hours light use before it truly needs recharging.\n", '\nBought on the first day and received in the same night in around 7hrs. Classy looks, excellent buttery smooth display and flawless performance.A bit underwhelmed by the camera performance till now. Sometimes the pictures are good sometimes are over beautified and smooth, needs retouching afterwords. But yet to test outdoors in depth.Photos attached are retouched a little.Battery seems to last a day with moderate use and occasional gaming.Phone is slightly heavier than expected or desired.Definitely worth an upgrade from 3T if you want a great display and performance.6-128 version will suffice the need of moderate users..\n', '\n4000mah Battery falls very short when you keep your device in 90Hz refresh rate & keep Dual VoLTE on. So It will hardly last you a day (12-18 hrs max). Don\'t expect more than 3hr Screen on time.Again the fingerprint Sensor is in the display like 6t and so it is not very responsive..Worth buying or Upgrade?BIG NO!!!---Now coming to something very important that no blog or youtuber is covering because they don\'t want to be in negative books of oneplus PR persons....Cutting down the price and promoting 6T everywhere saying "9000 Discount" just before a week of new phone i.e Oneplus 7 and fooling the consumers by making an impression that the newer version will be costlier then 6t.Then launching Oneplus 7 phone at the same price (32999) and making sure they laugh on all the consumers who bought old stuff thinking they got a good deal but in reality they all got fooled by a company with #Neversettle tagline but, in reality, they "MADE US SETTLE" and left all consumers feeling cheated.#NeverSettle for OnePlus! Once a cheater always a Cheater!!!\n', '\nVery bad service, Device started flickering after 20 days of purchase yet it was working for more then 10 days before it stopped all of a sudden, 100% Sure and gurantee that device was never ever close to any liquid, but then too service people said that device has water damage and I have to pay 17000 rs for replacing display.Pathetic and cheap style of earning more money like you earn in all different colour modules.Before I was proud to show my ohone to other people, now I got why iphones are better deal.50,000 is very hard to earn for a middle class person, I waited for this phone and buyed this phone by collecting 5000 every month from my salary of 25,000.I know phone is good, but the servie they offer is worst.\n', "\nI have used many phones being a gadget geek.

You might have to adjust for a day or 2 with the weight and the size of the phone but eventually you will love OnePlus7 Pro. I had used Android , Apple and OnePLus earlier but the touch of OnePlus 7 Pro is sublime, out of the world. Popping up of front camera feels kind of creepy initially but you will get used to it quickly. After a month of struggle of selection between iPhoneXR and OnePlus 7 Pro i made the decision to buy OnePlus 7 Pro and am really happy with the result. Go for it, do not think.\n', '\nMy previously used few mobiles - Galaxy S7,S8,Note 8,Note 9....This time i have decided to go with one plus for first time, and belive me,it was a fantastic decesion.Previously i am avoiding other mobile brands ,only for displays.But this time one plus hitted a bulls-eye.Thanks to great display.I am amongst first few members to buy this master piece,as soon as it has launched and i have taken full 20 days to evaluate this mobile to write this review.As promised,delivery of mobile was superquick by Amazon.I have received this mobile,even before it was released for regular customers,and available on retail outlets.Thanks to Amazon.This mobile is overall a very good package. Display of this mobile is fantastic,with crisp and clear pictures.Though samsung displays are little bit superior,but margin is very narrow and for day today work,margin is absolutely nil.This displays donot oversaturate the images and pictures.Battery life is fantastic and last for entire day easily with heavy use on 60 hz QHD setting.On 90 hz it is little less.Battery life is definately far far better compaired to my Note 9.Camera quality needs some improvements, but i am sure that one plus will definately rectify it in upcoming updates.Already,a update from one plus has improved camera performance drastically.Mobile is little overweight and big to handle for average sized hand people,but it is matter of just getting "used to it".Once you get used to it,you will definately enjoy using this mobile and watching movies on it.Sound quality is crispy clear and battery backup is also very good,even if you use blutooth headsets.Fingerprint reader is fast but still needs some improvement...SD 855 Processor is superfast.No need to review it,as this is fastest amongst all mobiles,i have used in past.UI is very good,and you can adjust it according to your needs.WRAP charging is fantastic.You will get decent battery charge within 15 min of charging this mobile in emergency situations,though it will not be required in day today practice,as battery backup is fantastic for mod-heavy users,as stated earlier.I my opinion,compairing price to performance ratio,this moble is the best mobile to buy to date.So "JUST GO FOR IT".Now ,I became a proud fan of one plus.\n', "\nThis is a review after a month usage:Pros:Display- 5+/5Camera 4.5/5Touch-4.7/5Battery-4/5Fast changing- 5+/5üòúFingerprint sensor: 5Now coming to the in-depth review, first thing was the Display: Which I noticed when I opened the package and switched on the phone was the built in wallpaper animation and that's when I immediately noticed the 90 hz fluid AMOLED display's awesomeness üòçüòç. Then the next time was while playing pubg, it's graphics was simply awesomeüòç. Then again the third time I fell in love was during the display setting when we can manually tune the display colours. And I really longed for a curved edge display phone for a long time and all these features put together felt awesome.Camera: At first, I was very sceptic about it as there were bad reviews swarming around cameraüòÖ. Then immediately the phone was demanding me to update it which I eventually did , which was around 2 gb. And then I took a few picture in artificial lighting with fingers crossed but it was fine. Then post that I thought the camera was not up to the marküòµ. But to my surprise it was me who was the culprit üòú and this came to light when I took some pictures during daylight, also I'm new to the triple camera setup so I was the one to be blamed for and not the phone, then as I got a hold of it the, picture quality was getting better and better üòç. So now I can say it has a pretty decent quality üòâ though it's not in comparison with other flagships out there I'm really happy with it's images also the 3x zoom feature will shock you as there is no loss in the image quality. Portrait mode is awesome but you will have to get used to it, selfie camera is also awesome, which also gives you awesome images üòç. Gaming: I'm not s hard core gamer at least in Mobile , since this device has pretty hardware built for games I thought of giving it a try, and to my surprise I fell for it at the login screen as the animations were so pleasing to the eyes üòç and during the game play there was no frame drops and the gameplay was pretty smooth üëçBattery: since it's a heavy 4k mAh battery I thought it would last for a more than a day on heavy usage, but it's not so coz of increased resolution and refresh rate, it drains the battery a lot especially during heavy usage, but if we are not using it much the battery easily lasts for 1.5 days, plus the Warp charging, just shatters your perspective about charging, coz it charges three device  from 10-100 in shy of 80 mins which is mind blowing.Finger print scanner is one of the plus for this device coz it's blazingly fast when compared to it's competitors üëçüòçOxygen Os: I'm a first time user and to me this interface is just as smooth as butter, the feel, the response,90hz refresh rate, vibrant Display all together is simply awesome. No lags so far. Will update this in coming months.Only con was the ear phone jack , but that can be resolved using a USB c to 3.5 converters , I used ptron adapter which is amazing and you can also charge and connect to earphones at the same time üòÖ.I guess that's it for now will update on near future, if you're planning to buy this you can blindly go for it and won't regret üëç\n", '\nWhy just Unlock Speed when you can Go Beyond Speed.My New One Plus 7 Pro!!!The OnePlus 7 Pro\'s camera, performance, and price make it the go-to premium Android phone of 2019.Overall, the phone looks fantastic.

The moment i turned on the display i was simply amazed by its quality, seriously it's just pleasure to eyes to watch and feel this display.Other than this performance, camera, OS, and premium look of Nebula blue all are just amazing.Go for it and trust me you not gonna regret it.\n", '\nThe mobile received on 14th of August and the screen started flickering on 20th September. The service centers declared that liquid damage is the reason and the cost will be 17000.00. Now, how can a person prove that it was not dip on water and its already water splash proof as declared on amazon. Very poor service and will not recommend for one+ series.\n', '\n"WHICH PHONE SHOULD I BUY?" Will be the common question of everyone today who are planning for the premium smartphone, especially with Snapdragon 855 Chipset.I think many of them have already written a detailed review of this product, OnePlus 7 Pro. But in this review, I want to focus on one issue of the current people, "WHICH PREMIUM PHONE SHOULD I BUY?"Because earlier, it was a very easy task to judge the best, flagship, worthy premium smartphone - OnePlus. But now, it appears very difficult to select the best flagship smartphone. Because now we have so many options like S10, Note 10, K20, etc. to select. And even I was totally confused. But after buying and researching many premium phones, I am concluding things in this review.So now let us start to compare almost each and every premium smartphone with this OnePlus 7 Pro smartphone so that it will be helpful for you to buy the right smartphone.1) Samsung Note 10: Priced at 70000, less battery capacity, less powerful processor, smaller screen, no 90-hertz screen smoothness, no Quad-HD. So here OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner. You can choose this Samsung Note 10, only if your preference is a compact smartphone with S-Pen. Or else, please buy OnePlus 7 Pro itself.2) Samsung Note 10 Plus: Priced at 80000 (oh my God), performs less powerfully with Exynos chipset when compared to OnePlus 7 Pro\'s Snapdragon 855 processor. I don\'t know why Samsung doesn\'t provide Snapdragon chipsets for few countries for S series premium smartphones, even after charging 80k. And still same display - no 90-hertz smooth screen. And one more funniest thing, no 100% display. I mean, still, they are providing punch-hole selfie camera on the main display, whereas pop-up selfies are provided by other brands at just Rs.15,000 now. Come on Samsung! Even after charging 80,000, no pop-up camera? Kidding? So according to me, here also the clear winner is OnePlus 7 Pro. If your preference is S-Pen alone with the latest premium smartphone from Samsung brand, please go for this and pour your hard-earned money.3) Redmi K20 Pro: I have used this. By paying 33k you will be hit continuously by MI dirty ads, for a poor quality AMOLED display. I hated this. No way match even for OnePlus 7. I can clearly tell that this can\'t even beat OnePlus older smartphones. Xiaomi should realize that customers are paying money for what they are providing. Earlier the scenario was different. Only MI smartphones were very much budget-friendly and ads were accepted (that too by some people). But now, showing ads is like totally killing themselves. OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner here too. And I really don\'t see any good reasons why people should opt for Xiaomi phones anymore. Until they stop ads and spoil kids, I don\'t recommend MI phones to anyone anymore.4) Oppo Reno: I have used this too. Earlier I used to think that all AMOLED screens will be great. Because earlier, there were just Samsung and OnePlus to provide commonly AMOLED screens. But I learned from Redmi K20 and Oppo guys, that all AMOLED screens are not the same. These screens can never match even Samsung\'s entry-level smartphones\' AMOLED display nor they can match OnePlus older versions\' AMOLED displays. And moreover, what I really hated much was ColourOS UI of Oppo. My god! It is horrible I felt. According to me, here also OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner though Reno also uses Snapdragon 855 processor. Choose this only if your preference is high zooming of your rear-camera. Because Oppo Reno has 10x zoom while OnePlus 7 Pro\'s has just 3x camera zoom.5) Black Shark 2: In this 100% display era, MI, along with popping ads, is again lacking to provide the full display. This is a smartphone of having infinity display like OnePlus 5T or Samsung S8 and S9 series. So here also the clear winner is OnePlus 7 Pro. Again, I don\'t see any good reasons to go for this smartphone.6) Asus 6z: This smartphone has failed to provide the AMOLED display in spite of being categorized as a premium phone. Very surprising. This itself enough to lose the competition I guess and OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner here too. If the price is the only criteria, one can choose this unique revolving camera smartphone.7) Samsung S10: Again, I don\'t think it is good to pay a huge amount (61,900) for a smartphone with no 100% display in this era. So the winner here also is OnePlus 7 Pro. If a compact powerful phone is what you want, one can go for this.8) Samsung S10 Plus: Same goes here. My god...Samsung\'s pricings are too much I feel when compared to OnePlus 7 Pro. So the winner here also is OnePlus 7 Pro. If superb camera quality is the only needed factor, one can go for this Samsung S10 Plus.9) Huawei P30 Pro: It is a known fact that Huawei and its sibling Honor was banned by the US for spying. And Android itself was expected to be killed on these phones. Though the ban is lifted for time being, it is not certain that the ban-lift will be permanent or temporary. So why should one risk in investing a huge amount on this brand? So I feel time waste in researching these brand\'s smartphones. So I prefer OnePlus 7 Pro only here also.10) Honor View 20: Same 9th point goes here.11) Huawei Mate 20 Pro: Same 9th point goes here.12) Google Pixels: Again, the Samsung theory goes here. When the era is of 100% displays, punch-hole cameras, infinity displays, notch displays, waterdrop displays, etc. are all meaningless I feel. So my choice is OnePlus 7 Pro without any doubts.So after researching and trying everything, I strongly feel that currently, OnePlus 7 Pro is the only model which can be trusted and you get more than what you pay.Frankly speaking, initially, when OnePlus launched this 7 Pro smartphone, I was disappointed by considering the price factor and the smartphone\'s size factor also. But now after using for a few days, that too after trying all other brands, I am really feeling that this OnePlus 7 Pro is worth for every penny you pay. Even the phone is NOT BULKY IF YOU USE A RIGHT SLIM CASE.The display itself mind-blowing and everything provided in the package is very, very powerful. All the three colors are beautiful - mirror grey, almond white, and nebula blue. Chose whichever you want. And feel free to submit questions to me. I will try to answer.\n', '\nI have buy this phone on the first when it come on amazon for sale. but after comparing this oneplus 7 pro camera with old oneplus 6 and oneplus 6t they have much batter camera then this op7 pro. but they are avalabile in 32999/- and i have spent 53000/- almost 20000 for this phone but i am not happy with this phone camera.i cant return this product because i have purchase this phone on bajaj emi. but now i am feeling cheated by oneplus india.\n', '\nFirst of all i m using ONE PLUS for the first time. The phone performance is mind blowing, no lag nothing at all.üñ•Ô∏èThe Display is so awesome, u will fall in love with it. üòçüòçüì∑ Camera is gud bt still it requires improvement in my viewüîã Battery is Good, i think due to big screen it consume battery a little faster, bt after updates it will be fixed definitely..üéÆGame lover Go for it no doubt..And dont think for negative review. I dont knw why people are so stupid.. üòÇ\n', "\nI had been using my OnePlus 3T since December 2016. The device was still good enough for my daily necessities but the battery life dropped down to a considerable extent so I decided to get the OnePlus 7 Pro. My expectations were quite high, and guess what? This phone gracefully rose past all of them. Here is my review after three weeks of usage. Trust me, I've used the stuffing out of the device in these three weeks.Desirable features :1. Display : Arguably the phone's strongest selling point. My mind was shuttling between the 7T and 7 Pro and the display is what sold by. Beautiful Quad HD curved display with 90 Hz refresh rate. Curved displays may not be for everyone, but I've condoned them since the s6 edge and hence, I personally love it. Accidental touches are also very rare (I do have fat fingers). As for the refresh rate, it improves the overall user experience and if you don't believe me, keep a phone with a 60 Hz screen next to this and you will definitely observe the difference. The screen is pretty bright and has legit outdoor visibility as well. Night and reading modes also ensure you have a pleasant experience using it in the dark. Screen flickering is not noticeable for the average user but you have the DC dimming option as well if in case you do notice it.2. Software optimization : Oxygen OS is OnePlus' forte. Undisputedly the best OS available for android. It is buttery smooth and packed with just the right amount of features. I didn't feel the need for a third party launcher. Rest assured, you will definitely receive regular software updates for three years at least.3. Performance : Moving from the 3T, this felt like riding a H2R after owning a splendour all my life. I haven't noticed any lags or stutters no matter what task I threw at it. As for gaming, I've saved it for the end of the review. PUBG lovers do check out the bottom of the review for a detailed PUBG review. Spoiler alert : it outperforms even some of the gaming phones on the market today.4. Audio output : The dual stereo speakers are very loud. The clarity is excellent for listening to media and taking calls as well. Dolby Atmos is the cherry on top of the cake.5. Camera : Many reviews said that the camera was a disappointment. Well, OnePlus seems to have fixed it with numerous updates because when I got my device and installed all the updates, the camera performance was splendid. Pro mode allows you to tweak the settings considerably. Slow motion videos are good too, though not the best. Any normal user would be very happy with the camera as I had no complaints. it doesn't beauty or oversaturate images. Initially, when I opened slow motion at night in indoor lighting, the screen was flickering and so did the resulting video. But it turns out it is not a manufacturing defect. The sensor cannot shoot slow motion videos on certain lighting conditions. But it works well in outdoor lighting. So if you try it for the first time indoors, do not freak out if this happens. Video recording at 4k;60fps is awesome too.TIP : Use Pro mode to click RAW images and then edit them on Snapseed. RAW files produce excellent details but also range from 20-30 MB per image. They are a little soft but Snapseed is all you need to edit the images.6. Network reception : Network reception and Wi-Fi speed is also much better. Internet speed is much better on this phone as compared to my older devices (3T and Mi A2 lite).7. Warp charging : It charges from 0 to 100 in just about an hour's time. And the best part is, the phone doesn't heat up at all. Only the adapter gets warm, but the phone doesn't heat up despite the charging speed.8. Design - The phone looks beautiful and feels premium. The notchless display is a treat to the eyes. I have the nebula blue variant and the frosted glass back looks magnificent. It feels great to hold and even better to behold.Well, this phone does everything you expect from a phone perfectly. So the pros list would go on and on.Could be better :Battery life - OnePlus packs a 4000 maH battery. It will easily last you through the day even if you are a heavy user. I get 6-7 hours of screen on time normally and a little over 5 hours if I do a lot of gaming and YouTube. I have my display set at 9 Hz and 1440p resolution so this does pull a lot off the battery. But considering the size and weight of this phone, OnePlus could have provided us with a battery. I did try setting the screen to 60 Hz and 1080p and it improved the battery life by roughly 15-20%, but what's the point of having such a powerful display and not being able to exploit it to the fullest?Liabilities :1. No headphone jack - When I buy a premium phone, I expect the company to at least pack a type C to 3.5mm adapter, if not a type C headphones. Come on, even apple gives you compatible earphones in the box. I spent an extra 390 bucks for the adapter. It works fine but would have been better if it came in the box.2. Tempered glass - OnePlus gives you an applied screen protector with the phone and it is good, but it is not shatterproof. When you have an expensive display, it is always better to secure it with a good tempered glass. But finding a good one is a pain. Either it has black edges, doesn't cover the screen completely, or the application process is a hassle and error prone. And they cost at least four times the amount for flat screen phones. Have ordered one from glazedinc, let's hope it fits the bill.A few perks :To make the phone look better, I downloaded wallpapers from unsplash. I also installed the flight icon pack (free version). You don't need a separate launcher for it, Oxygen OS allows you to use icon packs and it is quite simple. You can customize the icons and even change the name of the apps(useful if you want to be shady).Also installed an edge screen app. Have attached a screenshot of my home screen. Also, enable dark mode. The display makes it beautiful.Set animation scale in developer options to 0.5x for an even snappier experience.I suggest you use the fingerprint scanner and avoid face unlock as the front camera has to pop up Everytime you need to unlock your phone. Besides it is very accurate and fast too. I've disabled finger unlock animation so make it seem faster (perception hack).Verdict :I have the 8GB RAM/256GB ROM version.  It is worth the 43 grand damage. Given a second chance, I'd still pick the same phone again and I am sure you would too. After all, it won the MVP award in MKBHD's smartphone awards 2019. :)PUBG Mobile review :This is an absolute beast of a phone for PUBGM. Default settings itself was set to HDR + Extreme and it handled it very well. Constant 60 fps was achieved with minor drops to 58 and never below that. I personally prefer to play at Smooth + Extreme as bullets register the fastest in these settings (as said by professional players). I'm a four finger claw + full gyroscope player. I picked up full gyro practicing for just two weeks in this phone. Touch response is super quick and there are no multi touch issues. Gyro response is also perfect and I play with the same sensitivity as Snax. My gameplay has improved a lot with this phone. Curved display wasn't an issue for me at all. You also have an in built screen recorder that records both internal and external audio. Recording your gameplay doesn't affect the performance at all. Minor heating is noticeable after two classic matches if you're recording. 5 minutes of recording at 60fps will consume close to 1GB of your storage. I can game for around 4-4.5 hours when the phone is fully charged. There is no thermal throttling and phone's performance does not drop at all. Besides, the notchless screen improves.yoir gaming experience and haptic feedback is excellent too. If you're looking for an amazing gaming performance as a bonus, this is the phone for you. The frame rate is even more consistent than ROG phone 2, second maybe only to iPhones.\n", "\nThe display is amazing and it just grows on you. You can never use any other handset after using this display.Battery is good for 1 and half day usage but the wrap charge is dope.Weight is a bit heavy and big screen but big phones are the call of the day so can't complain much.Design is so attractive and feels can never be backdated even after using this for 2 years.Camera specs are awesome and software is good bit with time it will improve more I am sure. Don't get me wrong it gets decent pictures and great selfies.\n", '\nWorks like a charm little hefty but butter smooth.And for people talking about incomplete product delivery what you see on youtube is reviewers unit jot retail unit so stop with the dumb comments.My only complaint is that there is no headphone in the box and nor did the company provide the adaptor for the same\n', "\nIt's a beautiful beast. Screen is the best . No notch and no hole , the view is clear and you enjoy it. Oxygen Os is always like a stock android which is the best. Camera is okay. But yes I think they should have added type c 3.5 mm converter out of the box in such price segment.\n", '\nThe first thing firstThe design is awesome.Specs are awesomeAnd almost near to stock android is also awesome.This mobile is just super fast.I think spending 50k + on this is better than spending on Samsung items.\n', '\nSuper bad... Extremely disappointing camera, bad fingerprint sensor, not worth the money\n', '\nAwesome product from one plus and comes to camera quality, it has improved alot after the software update (OS 9.5.7)Only thing i felt personally as a con for this mobile is its huge 6.67 inch display which is a bit tricky to handel.Battery life is very good and lasts for minimum 24 hrs if you are using it for quite a bit heavy as well.I would suggest this mobile if you are fine and can cross over your budget.\n', "\nI'll go through all points what's good, what's bad and what oneplus could've done better.THE GOOD-very good in gaming-very beautiful design to look at-very good & optimized software-very future proof-no overheating, throttling, etc-very good speakers (both clarity & loudness)THE BADPoor Screen protectorpre-applied screen protector is of very poor quality. It gets scratches sitting in my pocket within few days of use. I'm not sure it'll survive even a month and btw I am a person who take extreme care of my devices.Warp ChargerIt's very fast but phone feels slightly warm from back as well as front side while charging. i tried dash charger and there was no such problem. So, I am sticking with dash most times.Provided Covercover is ok. it's a bit on thicker size but not as thick as my 6t but ulike 6t dust, etc can get in this cover which is very annoying as I have to constantly clean it.Fanatic modeIt's not practical to use it as it blocks all calls, notifications, etc and don't even give us option to turn some of these things off. Gaming mode is fineA bit overpricedRobert Downy Jr, Amitabh Bhacchan, and other big stars are promoting this device and it looks like we're paying price for those big names as this device is not 14,000 different from regular oneplus 7IN-BETWEEN GOOD & BADCameraBack camera is hit or miss, sometimes it click very sharp and detailed photos but other-times it's photos are little on softer side and sometimes I felt that there's some beautification going on. But overall it gets the job done.Battery lifewith 90hz and QHD+ on battery life is average but with 60hz and FHD+ it's pretty even slightly better than my 6t, still battery life can be improved.About the sizeAlthough I prefer small phones and this is sure not a small one. It's very bulky but handling is ok you'll get use to it\n", "\nI have been using this phone from more than a week now. Here are the things I liked and disliked:# Display is Great (but its glamour goes away after putting on a back cover, which is necessary as the phone is too slippery without it üôÅ)# Camera is not that great if we see it from the price point. I was using OnePlus 5T before this and i feel i had a better camera setup. Also, I don't know why nobody is talking about the Portrait mode of the rear camera, it automatically zooms the image 3x, making it hard to take portraits of a nearby people/objects. Also, zooming 3x makes things very shaky and hard to take a steady shot. Really not satisfied with the Portrait mode's auto cropping zoom. Similar issue was there in OnePlus 5, the first OP phone having a dual camera setup, but the issue was resolved in 5T.# The next big thing that no one is talking about in the reviews is unavailability of Notification LED. This is seriously a big turn off for me.# Battery backup is decent considering the screen size and display quality.# The phone is too slippery without a cover. The phone attracts a lot of dirt and is also a fingerprint magnet.# The company should have provided a better back cover and Type C earphones (or at-least the Type C to 3.5mm jack converter) within the box at this price.# I also purchased the OnePlus Wireless Bullets 2 separately. Their sound quality it's good but there is no sound feedback received (the connecting beep sound that you get after long pressing the button) while using Google Assistant via the button on wireless bullets. Even my wired earphones provide that feature.Overall its a good phone if camera is not a great deal for you. Though the OnePlus should have kept the starting price of this phone under 40k. Instead of wasting money on advertisement and making big celebrities their brand ambassadors, the company should stick to their original vision of providing flagship killer features at an even killer Price tag.\n", "\nThe phone is great. Few features are best in class like the display, processor, ram, sound is good but slightly tuning is needed to it, I think it is loud. Camera is good but not great and battery is enough for 1 day. Fast and adaptive os. I like the performance most. It's smooth, fast and no heating issues yet. So, for me, it is ideal phone. And really like the pop up camera, specially for face unlock.\n", '\nNever buy this product or anything from oneplus within 8 days this phone is not working because of just little rain and now company is asking me to pay 41000 to repair it. The Chinese companies are only to loot Indian people.\n', '\nOverall Beast as everyone says!! but few things i have noticed after usage since a week..firstly i wud say RAM is being used drastically.. just for normal usage it wud consume approx 5 to 6 GB RAM without any reason.. i dunno how does that processing work at all...and battery is drastically draining since 2 days.. earlier 5 days were EPIC.. now i really do not understand what the problem is.. as the usage is same as before. planning to get it replaced but wat if it works the same!!!Camera app is not at all good. thy really need to upgrade their software to match the market level phones like pixel and nokia.Overall little disappointed with 12 GB Beast phone... Expectations were high but lets hope for the best for further usage..EDIT :  After 20plus days of usage and 2 updates working really fine and battery issue also resolved with some apps management. Now battery works upto 36 to 48 hrs for one single charge. Will update more once after i use it liitle extensively for few more days... Stay tuned!\n', "\nThe blue beast.Everything is great.They should have included the the headfone adapter.Stop complaining about the weight even iphone xs max weighs 208 gms.Night scape mode in this phone is just superb. Better than iphone or galaxy s10 plus.And this phone is a performance monster.Chose this phone over galaxy s10 plus and I have zero regrets.Go for it and you'll not regret.\n", "\nGood points:1) quality feels premium while holding it in hand2) Superb sound quality and clarity3) Awesome display to look at4) Warp charging is much more faster than Dash charging  + battery retention time is average5) 90Hz barely makes a difference as compared to OnePlus 3 I used before this. But yes, Its indeed much more refined and smooth(still doesn't justify the price tag)Bad Points:1) The camera although takes awesome pictures, but it does get blurred while zooming and viewing the pic from gallery2) The pop up mechanism makes mechanical sound while switching on/off. At this price, it bothered me. It could have been seamless.3) Bit heavy and huge. Gives a feeling of nervousness while holding it without any case(as its made of glass body)4) front camera is average. Similar to OnePlus 5T I would say(not much difference)\n", "\nNever purchase from amazon, mostly products are defective and mostly there is no refund/exchange also. Instead purchase from one plus store. Be cautioud, i'm the victim, i don't others to be.\n", "\nBought this device a month ago and during first couple of days the phone was overheating while charging. Within a few days, one plus rolled out an update and after that the issue was resolved. Speaking about the pros I would say the phone justifies its price. The look and feel of the phone is truly elegant and no words for its sleekness. Some people may find it a bit bigger, but when you are in love with tech and ready to shell out 50k on a phone, these issues are negligible.Secondly, the display is sheer beauty. It's crisp and bright, and the difference is visible!I don't use the phone like a maniac, hence I get a full day backup on a single charge. And even if you are a heavy user, still a 15 minute charge is more than enough to keep you going for next couple of hours.The sound quality is also very good, thanks to Dolby Atmos.RAM management doesn't need any discussion. One plus phones are already prominent for their RAM management.Camera quality was initially on the lower side, but one plus has rolled out an update for that and, since, the camera quality has improved a lot.Lastly, the bigger screen paves way for a comfortable gaming experience.And now about the cons:The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow than the physical scanner, but the AI will get used to your fingerprints and overtime it will automatically improve. (Faced this issue was initially, but now it is quick as a Ferrari)Absence of headphone jack means shelling out extra cash for wireless headphones.No LED notification light. You have to check your phone so as to ensure you have not missed out on something.I am not a professional reviewer but I have tried my best to include my overall experience with the phone.Conclusion: One plus has, no doubt, used 'cream of the crop' ingredients to make this beautiful piece of tech. I don't have any regrets for upgrading from OnePlus 6. After all, you have to loose certain things to gain a better one!Peace.\n", '\nOverall nice phone.I bought it because I wanted a notch less and fully bazelless phone so I am happy with it though it slightly big.I personally recommend OnePlus 7 because of these reasons:-1. You can save 20 thousand rupees for same features.2. Size of the phone is more suitable and handy. OnePlus 7 pro has awkward and uncomfortable size.3. Its too heavy your wrist starts to fall when continuous usage.4.Pop up camera seems good but not reliable for long run.5. Warp charging is just a hype It takes more than 2 hours to fully charge.Some good things because of them I bought it.1. Best display with 90 Hz frame rate.2. Curved display.3. No notch.4. So basically I gave 20 thousand more for the sake of better or say best display in market right now.\n', "\nOnePlus 7 Pro is a mammoth.The closest competition - the dilemma was should I go for the pro and pay 53k or the standard version and be done within 35k or so. Both have the same heart and soul. However, a waterdrop camera is a weird prospect. That, and only that made me choose the Pro. But when I got the Pro, I realised that the screen that came with it was just fabulous. I have never seen something like this and I will not see this in any other phone this year.The real flagship - Now that I am ready to shell 53k, it made sense to rather weigh the alternatives. S10 is the obvious answer but that punch hole is a turnoff for me. And again of all the features that S10 has that the OnePlus 7 Pro lacks, headphone jack is the only one I miss. Oh, and did I tell you about the screen on the Pro.... It's gorgeous!The backroom - I have always believed that a product is a reflection of how the company thinks. Behind every great product is a group with high standard of ethics, skills and the never settle attitude. Beside Apple, I have found that in this time (June 2019) companies like OnePlus and Honor (Huawei) are frontrunners in their products as well as their vision. So go for their products. Honor does have better camera.The new OnePlus 7 Pro lacks in camera. It's the only area it lacks in. But I see promise in the brand and future updates will make it better. I believe it. The battery drains faster when you play video games or watch videos. I found my screen on time to be close to 5.5 hrs with 16% battery remaining. 20% of the time was spent on PUBG, 15% on Google Play services and a combined 20%+ on videos. I found it quite underwhelming. However, once you take a break from your phone and go for lunch or a bath, you will be surprised to see how fact it charges. 0-100 in an hour. In fact plug it in for 15mins and you will see a 30% increase in charge.Everything else works like a charm. The fingerprint sensor is great. The first few times will be erratic but then it gets accustomed to the user. Works fine from there.The sound quality is almost great. It is loud but I wished that it was a tad bit better.The Oxygen OS is doing its job as we speak. It is so natural that you might not just feel that it's not stock Android. It's very close it the stock. And it's nothing extravagant. Oxygen OS is just right...Overall, rating hereBuild 9/10 just for the lack of official IP rating.Camera 7/10 I have taken better pics from phones that cost half. Pop up camera is good.Display 10/10 can't explain why. You need to see for yourself.Charging 9/10 This thing is a monster with Warp charger. And I don't need the wireless charging.Processor 9/10 Blazing fast. Took away a point because there is always room for improvement.Value for money 8/10 the phone is great but the camera could be better. As a user, I am very satisfied. I would rather hold OnePlus 7 Pro than the Samsung S10+.Nominating the Pro for the best smartphone of 2019.Enjoy your shopping!\n", "\nIt's okay okay Phone nothing so much extra ordinary about op7pro in 50 k plus budget. For me i have used Lg v30 plus . I find v30 plus had better features and technologies than this one. V30 plus comes with Wireless charging  ,IP68 rating, quadack headphone jack. In 4gb ram it runs fine i have played PUBG in it for year long and never ever it said restarted . I found divice is beat underrated. If you are planning for same features go for it. Now LG v30 plus comes in 25 k . May be you can plan buy LG V40 plus in latest in OP7PRO budget with better features .Phone start working on itself.Finger sensor works only if you press rightly and tightly fingerprint sensor sucks compare to other flagship phone I will not recommend OP7 Pro.Wasted 50k.\n", "\nIt's been a week since I bought the phone. This phone is one of the best Android phones in the market right now.Pros1) Display is the best aspect of this phone2) Performance is pretty good3) Fingerprint reader is very quick4) Dolby stereo speakers is really good5) One thing I noticed while playing Asphalt game for over an hour is that phone didn't get heated up too much6) Battery backup isn't bad. Warp charge helps in quick charging of the phone for extreme usage7) Response time of front camera is pretty goodCons1) Phone is a bit bigger2) No 3.0 mm audio jack which could have been compensated with bullets wireless earphones given the phone's cost3) Camera hardware might be really good but camera app certainly needs improvement. This is my opinion after comparing images taken with S10, S10+ and also given that OnePlus ran ads claiming OP 7 pro being used in multiple photoshootsThis phone is really worth the cost except for the camera app which I think will be improved with the upcoming updates.\n", "\nWell what to say, Oneplus has killed it its own legacy. Previously known as flagship killer for better pricing... But now meh... Looks like Oneplus is trying to go as the likes of Samsung, and Apple of being EXPENSIVE. Overall i liked the performance, it's crazy fast, 90hz refresh rate makes the overall experience much better. Charging is super fast but, but the camera could have been much better, day light photos are good but when you try to take videos with the wide angle camera, it crops the frame. Performance is top notch, display is only thing I bought this phone. Super sharp and crystal clear QHD+ Oled display gives an immersive experience while watching videos and Netflix content. But battery life should have been improved from its last counterparts. On paper its 4000 mAh but because of the display that consumes more battery, it last atleast a day barely. Oneplus need to provide some serious updates for the existing bugs and need to improve in camera department.\n", "\nIts a beast machine to be honest. more satisfying than what i  expected.it works smooth as a butter bounces when you swipe that show's how smooth it operates your every processor in a quick and promptly ways. Really worth it.what made me dissatisfied was they should atleast provide the music jack adopter were you paying 48,999 for the machine.rest everything incredible and suprisingly unexpected.charger works like it's only made for quick charging as hell.charges my battery from 1%-100% within 70-80minutes and make me use for 2 days when not on over using.\n", "\nUndoubtedly it's a product for the rationale consumers who always wants to maximize their utility against budget constraint.It may be that even the famous reviwers also somewhere divided in their opinion regarding considering one plus 7 pro as a true flagship killer or flagship itself.But,as I am not a rivewer but as a massive user of versatile phones regarding brands and variations,one thing I must say after using it no one can stop themselves to make it a permanent daily driver at least for now,that is until something powerful will come in terms of phone.It's a beast with beauty.A beautiful wait balanced, mesmerizing display, unique haptic feedback,tactile alert slider,clean and wonderfully positioned stereo speakers,fast and furious finger print sensor,superb connectivity,sweet and smooth performance, considerable battery life, fantastic ram management, decent camera wrapped with unique and silky operating system and support of one plus community...uffff ...like Shankar Mahadevan's breathless song.No one can deny its overall overwhelming performance.Though I miss 3.5 mm jack but it's ok,I can manage it.But,the customers, specially the one plus fan feel more joyous if atleast,one plus provide a headphone or atleast a connector within the box.I also use S10 plus ceramic black and iPhone X's but even after having those world's best two gadgets,I must say salute to speed and never settle!üòò\n", "\nI love this mobile because it fulfill all of my requirements.I loved haptic feedback feature given by oneplus and during games like pubg it gives amazing experience.. Thumbs up for this. This device is beast for gaming.but there are some issues with this mobile..1. Camera quality is not satisfactory according to there price range.2. Too much heavy but comfortable in grip or in hold.3. Fringerprint sensor is fast and efficient but sometimes it doesn't recognize or takes time to open mobile.\n", '\nI am very much upset at the phones working. I have used one plus  3t, 5,  6, 6t but unfortunately this phone when in landscape mode blank screen is showing.  Being number one e-commerce site has to check in all parameters before despatch as customer buys only on name AMAZON  tag.  The set has to be replaced or repaired at doorstep by One plus. They have to sell genuine products when competitors increase\n', "\nPROS:1.) The first and most basic thing is OnePlus have always met the perfect requirement of a techie like me &2.) speaking about the price it's apt for what they have provided. People who are calling it pricey please use it for a week you'll find the difference. 3.)This one's a beast it can perform any kind of activity that the current smartphones can do.4.) Camera quality is awesome you can't expect a DSLR on a phone & don't compare it with all those apples or Galaxy s10s etc because your requirement is full filled UpTo the mark by a OnePlus 7 pro.5.) The oxygen OS is the most user friendly user ever.6.) Fingerprint sensor is in-display and it is best in class.7.) The front cam is a popup cam and it's not at all having any issues it's perfect it comes out and goes in lightning fast so no lags from the face detection.8.) Display is lit üî• af ! Even in 60Hz it goes like buttery smooth then 90Hz I'm leaving to your imagination.9.) Buttons & Gestures are the top notch features of OXYGEN OS and you'll find them very very useful in the OnePlus 7 pro.10.) The nebula blue color is damn awesome it's really pretty cool sexy superb. I named it BLUNEY üòúCONS :1.) The one and only backdrop is that no 3.5MM headphone Jack so all your old headphones or earphones are going to be wasted or there is a requirement of a connector from type C to 3.5MM.This connector is missing in the box.& The suggestion to OnePlus is they should've given the connector or an type C earphones in the box because we are paying 58000 and that's the least we can expect.Also a display clean cloth and a 2 or 3 extras need to be added in box.To the people who are saying they are showing a cloth , a car charger , a Bluetooth earphones , etc etc in the advertisements or YouTube review videos, it's a review video or advertisement where the people are given a whole different box which is made for a review it's not a sale unit please remember thats their advertisement and review strategy !Still if you can manage with a type C to 3.5mm connector or a  type C earphones then other than that this one's the best phone I've seen. There's no other issue with it as of 1 weeks usage.\n", "\nOne plus 7 Pro. An amazing phone. A real good upgrade from the Samsung galaxy phone which I was using for about 2 year (s7 edge). It's way ahead of these Samsung crawlers in terms of speed, performance, aesthetics, versatility and price. This phone is for power users. Very fast touch experience. Really fluid display and cool on eyes. Camera is excellent especially for low lights. There are lots of aspects yet to be explored but one thing is confirmed. This phone is a quantum leap in terms of speed and response. Too good.\n", "\nMy previous device was Vivo V9.  I start regretting from the first day of V9 and then I made a promise to myself to never purchase a Vivo or Appo device.Finally, after a lot of thinking, I purchased this with my tight budget but I never regret this decision even it costed me a fortune.Pros:-1. Fastest, never hangs (except for the 2nd day of purchase, which usually happens with oneplus).2. Display is the best thing about this device. I can't get over looking the screen and my gf feel jealous of it.3. With 90Hz refresh rate, phone looks much faster (well now I hate using other devices, they seems too slow).4. Rear camera is good, works well in day as well as in night with night scape mode (though night mode is pain in the a..)5. Phone looks and feel very premium.6. Fast charging with Wrap is lightning.7. Software is the next best thing9. Loudspeakers are really awesome.10. Screen finger print gets faster with day to day uses, Haptic Vibration is very good, Alert slider is very convenient.Cons:-1. Front camera is poor but this is expected from a pop-up camera.2. Battery backup is very poor and worse if you use 90hz with UHD display.The only thing I'm disappointed from is the price drop. It hurts like hell when you purchase one on the actual price and few months after it gets discounted. Price should be constant on oneplus devices.\n", '\nThis is the best phone I ever had from one plus. Following are the pros and corns. Let me start with pros followed by corns next :Pros :1). Best in class display.  It has overtaken even the Samsung phones. However it‚Äôs AMOLED panel is made by Samsung.2).  Best camera experience. Better than Samsung S10.3).  90 Hz refresh rate on the screen. First in its segment.4). Dash Charge :  hi speed charging, achieves 100%  within an hour.5). Battery lasts for more than a day for medium to heavy usage with data on.6). Does not heat up so it‚Äôs predecessors as it comes with liquid cooling panel. Ideal for heavy gamers.Corns :1).  The device is very heavy it weighs around 210 g2). Very slippery in nature Due to its glossy finish. Back cover is must.3).  Does not fit properly in your front pocket Due to its oversize.4). Though it is made out of glass, it does not support wireless charging.5).  Does not have 3.5 MM audio jack. You need to connect wireless through Bluetooth device or through type C wired headset.\n', "\nThe most expensive OnePlus phone yet and they definitely have done a great job. The moment you look at the 90FPS AMOLED you are above to fall in love and also will be main selling reason of the phone. It definitely beats iPhone xs in terms of performance and the smoother animations certainly helps. Gaming on this amazing display is a delite and all the games works really buttery smooth. OnePlus has also improved the haptic feedback on this device tho it can not match the level of iPhone but a good change is always welcome. The phone has its downside however, first the camera. I don't see any major improvement in the camera after coming from OP 6 I still feel its kinda the same although OP has this time around went with completely different sensor. Photos from the main sensor are great with great detailing tho falls in low light situation. The telephoto lens doesn't perform that great and found images to be washed out in most scenarios tho a software update can hopefully fix this. Finger print scanner is quick but it sometimes won't recognize the finger no matter what. Battery life isn't that great but with moderate use it can go for entire day of usage. Speakers are a much upgrade from last OP devices which is now stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos on board. Speakers however do offer decent feedback and can get really loud if thats what you want.Pros:Boy oh boy that display!Performance is top notch and is certainly the best performance phone in the market today.Price; considering how expensive phones have got lately I will say OP7 pro packs a lot and will certainly make users happy.Oxygen OS - I would prefer Oxygen OS over stock Android as it offers much more than what stock has to offer without losing the minimalist charm. Oxygen OS always have provided on top time software updates which is a pro in itself.ConsCamera's could have been better.Fingerprint scanner doesn't work properly sometimes.Speakers could have been better.OP should at least provide earphones in the box considering the price they are charging.\n", "\nI brought it 5 days ago and lots of thinking between S10 then gone for this one. Sinse last 6 years I am using Samsung S series and still have my S8 as my secondary backup phone. No doubt the phone is good, fast, speedy, great display. I am not regret as its best value for money when hardware, performance and price considered. All these below points are just I dont like, there are lots of other things which I like as well.1. The phone is heavy and big. 207gram feels like a brick. If you fill-up a phone with features but still form factor is not practical use then this is a fail. UFS 3.0 storage only have write speed of 229MB/S, this is lower than some phones with UFS2.1 example: S10. The phone design is common and looks just like other Mi, Vivo Oppo phones. No X factor. In my view its a premium Chinese phone.2. Camera is a myth. Sony IMX586 is a failed and over hiped sensor in its era. Now a days used in mid range Chinese phones. I wish OnePlus should have skipped this one. If camera in a phone is your primary requirement then keep away from this. I love photography and have my DSLR for that so I dont trust any phone camera or that was not a concern for me. I have tested in all conditions and sorry to say this is a bad camera for a flagship. Front camera is good enough and I like it including its design. I recommed that please turn of scene recognition, auto HDR in camera settings menu to click at least some good pictures in day light. For night or dark light camara is good I believe. I assumed that the developer team put their entire efforts to bring a camera which can provide good photos in night and forget that we take most of the photos in day light. So those night calibrated auto settings will ruin your daylight photos. But still even if you try to get best shots, its far behind Apple and Samsung Cameras.3. Oxygen OS is good and fast I am using 1st time, but it doesn't have native apps like Email Client, Music Player, Payment App, Security App, Calendar, Contact, Phone Call and so many others. For all these it's depending on stock Android. Now you say whats a big deal? Apps are available in playstore for free to download. But I think those free application are comes with lots of advertisements, notification and even Google native apps track you for their add selling. I use yahoo mail, why I will pay yahoo 350 rupees monthly to use their email client. Another thing I noticed that Home bar doesn't auto hide during keyboard popup so I accidentally click the home key many times during type and suddenly go to home screen. That is a big drawback. The home bar should be hide during type. OnePlus please look that simple but very useful stuff.Rest assured, I also agree with others that its an insanely fast phone. Battery is best in class as per my use. This is a good phone and would be best if Oneplus taken care of some useful requirements. A great Display and good hardware will not certify a phone as a flagship. There are lots of other aspects need to be considered. This phone doesn't fulfilled my criteria of a flagship however personal choices may be different by individuals.\n", "\nHad the 6t before this and wanted to check this phone out for it's 90 hz display and QHD+ resolution. It turns out the hype is real and once you start using this display, it's hard to use the one on the 6t or any other phone (60 hz I believe). You can actually tell the difference.The all-screen no-notch display is excellent and with 516 ppi, the display is very sharp and the performance is super fast. (I got the 12/256 version).Although you can turn the display back to output 60hz, you'll get so used to the 90hz that you'll have a hard time adjusting.Got it on the Diwali offer on Amazon with quick and damage-free delivery.Don't really use the selfie camera much on any phone, so can't really comment on that. But it does help that it's hidden on top so that you get a notch-free display. Can't comment on the back camera either as I'm not really a big photo-taking person.Should you get the 7t Pro instead of this? It depends, if you just want the McLaren edition or the 855+ chipset. Otherwise, this is an amazing option as it released just four months before and at the current price for the maxed out 12/256 version, it makes a lot of sense that you go for this.\n", "\nI had purchased one Plus 7 pro 8 GB Almond color from Amazon based on a friend's suggestion but totally regret the purchase. I'm a new user for One Plus & previously owned Apple, Vivo,Letv, Coolpad, Samsung, Honor, Motorola,Xolo,etc.,never experienced such an awkward performance in those mobile's. Spending half a Lakh Indian rupees on this mobile the File manager videos file's takes time to load in order to open the same, While on call second call gets answered automatically, Both front & Back camera clarity are not up to the mark & there are lots of other issues while using the mobile I'm not at all happy using this device & feel like exploited for buying a premium range mobile with a basic mobile's performance. Need a solution for the same at the earliest.\n", "\nAmazing performance. Gamers are gonna love this phone. I can't believe how incredibly fast the fingerprint scanner is.When it comes to camera, no words can explain its potential. With the right knowledge of photography you can capture amazing shots. In the pro mode it provides great features where you can control the shutter speed, iso, manual focus. You can check it out in YouTube.Coming to the display its very smooth. You can only feel the difference when you have been using your phone for a couple of days and then try to use your old phone.Battery life is good. But not that great. The 90hz drains a lot of battery.Theres tons of other things that make this phone great. Or else why do you think I would be typing such a long review.So guys, if you have around 50k budget, trust me, this is the one.\n", "\nSeriously i bought this phone because i thought one plus is a true premium phone and one plus 7 pro would be a new flagship killer.

I also own an iphone X and its even smoother than the X in gaming)All in all my only problem was the lack of a headphone jack and rest i am really satisfied with the purchase.\n", "\nS10(+) vs OP7Pro.. I chose this since it's superior in the OS, Warp charge, SD855 gaming and few more. It also matches up with its OLED display to the major flagships out there.

I was shipped with a defective unit. The screen had burn in issues. I just don't get it. If i am the first owner of the phone, how can it have screen burn in.

It depends on how you use the phone. If gaming is your priority it is smooth and fast but battery won't last long. Warp charger is fast . While charging phone heats up and automatically cools down at a percentage. By keeping in 90 Hz and resolution to auto switch it saves battery.The main flaw is no 3.5 mm jack, no type c to 3.5mm adaptor provided in the package .  Tempered glass not available for the phone in their website too.( If they are releasing a phone they should have accessories too but in OnePlus all accessories are out of stock). Price of the product is high.

The one and most amazing aspect I like about this product is its display for which I would give 4.5/5 compared to iPhone XS Max display which would be 4/5 according to my experience.  In performance factor also I would say that this will be the fastest phone I have ever used. Apart from these 2, this phone is just like any other Android phone in this price range or slightly above. The camera is just an average component and cannot be called as a flagship feature here (except night shots are pretty amazing though). The size is also quite huge that its difficult to operate it with just one hand. Charging is pretty decent and would take around .1 - 1.15 hours from 0-100. Battery back is the same as that of one plus 6t which will last for a day with a full charge and medium usage. Overall I would say this is an okayish product but not an amazing product from the future.\n", "\nRubbish item!!!!! No data security . Phone gets unlocked by anyone , only thing u will have to do is just don't let the secondary camera pop up (by applying finger pressure over camera)after u press power button for 3-5 seconds.

I love playing PUBG and Asphalt 9 on Top setting and Result are terrific.2) Portrait Mode - OnePlus has never been the Best Camera device in market but OnePlus7pro has one top notch portrait mode. You will love taking Portrait in this device.3) Speed - With Latest 855 Snapdragon , I never laid hands on such smooth Android device . I can directly compare smoothness to IphoneX on this device.4) Built Quality - OnePlus 7 Pro has very strong built quality which I found very impressive. I did checked out YouTube videos to found its durability and was impressed.5) OxygenOS: With OxygenOS the experience of Android is smooth as silk.Cons :Water Proof : Only reason to not buy this mammoth phone . I was planning Huawei P30 Pro but then we have water proof cases for that purpose.Fingerprint Sensor : It does seems temperamental at times .Headphones : No Headphone Provided with devices and No Headphone Jack . Seriously heavy disappointment.Wireless Charging : Wireless Charging is a show off feature. We all know it's very slow but it does look good to flaunt.Weight : If you don't prefer Heavy phones , let this go . ONEPLUS 7pro is 200 gms and definitely feels heavy . Though I found  myself attracted to heavy phones .Review : If Best camera is priority  and you do tend to take underwater photography seriously, Spend 20K Extra for Huawei P30 Pro.OnePlus 7pro has a great camera , it's 3x zoom and bokeh is awesome . And is a great device , if you are looking for Good Camera , Super Cool Build and Best Performance.Speed is what OnePlus were really always selling here. This time they really went Beyond Speed.\n", "\nThe battery back up on the so called 4000 mAh is only 7 hours. This 7 hours is with just 20 minutes screen usage.Raised a replacement request with Amazon. The technician who was supposed to visit on the scheduled day called up and mentioned that battery issue can come up because of apps and also the screen resolution. I have been using one plus 5t and it lasted 20-25 hours with the same usage and same applications. I had to put all my applications in optimise in the 7 pro to keep the battery last till evening. My friends using one plus 7 (not the pro) did not face any issue and their batteries lasted for over 20 hours.The worst part on Amazon's side is that the technician did not turn up and I got an email saying I was not reachable. When I contacted the technician he mentioned that he was busy with other customers and so he turned down my req. Now Amazon calls me back the next day from some unknown number and asks me for my details to place this technician request.Why playing cheap tactics to avoid replacement amazon by extending the dates ?\n", "\nThe phone is worth of money .I have seen on youtube they provide headphones and car dash charger with two extra cover.But i didn't get any of them totally disappointed with one plus team.If they are not giving such things then they should not show such things in their videos along with box .\n", '\nEverything was great. This is my first OnePlus device and I really love it. Some people complaint some things in review section but if you want to get good quality product then ignore those negative reviews and go for it.\n', "\nProduct is awesome but delivery was delayed.the first thing you'll notice is that it is blazing fast. The camera pops up everytime for facial unlock which looks a little bothering somehow otherwise this phone is power packed. Battery life will go on for more than a day for me easily with daily chores on my phone as I am not a gamer.\n", "\nI have been using OP7 Pro for last 7 days and I found performance of the phone, camera, battery live up to OP expectations until 7th days.  I witnessed a song app is playing music even after I killed all the process. As last step, I restarted the phone and to my surprise phone got stuck at restart for a minute or so without doing anything. After couple of minutes, I see screen going blank and photo just died. It won't start whatever you do. I finally found that this is a happening to many OP7 Pro phones and way to recover is pressing Power and Volume up key.Overall very disappointed . This has made me think if we should even trust and buy any more OP phone at all.I also found that once you purchase a phone through Amazon, it is not easy to return a defective phone. Even if you are still within 10 day return window, you cannot just ask for a replacement for defective phone. You have to spend good amount of time with Amazon customer service who will get a technician to visit you and find all ways not to accept the return which is very disappointing.So, firstly it is good to avoid this model till OP fixes this issue. If you still want to buy it, better buy it from retain stores and not online because you will be stuck with this product even if you don't want to.\n", '\nThis is my personal review after 2 days of usage and one thing is for sure , that this is the BEST DISPLAY ever, just like said at the event "FAST AND SMOOTH". Watching series/movies is a pleasing experience and hands on to One plus for that.The performance is smooth and amazingly fast as always with OP. They are Masters in this segment.I saw many comments on social media regarding the average battery backup, yes it is true but with WARP CHARGING it doesn\'t really matters. It is more than a balance to me. I won\'t mind burning more battery for a smoother experience which is new and missing with other brands.The biggest drawback I felt is the Camera. The pop up camera has got too much crop and if you open the video then you might end up shooting yourself only. The Rear camera too needs some optimisation which I am sure we will see soon.One thing which I want to bring in notice is the "NIGHTSCAPE" mode in Rear camera, it was working good before the first update and as soon I updated it , the quality went down. Same is with the normal one as well.One thing I felt which should have been given is the Type-C to 3.5mm jack cable, that was indeed missing. Rest everything is just perfect.Overall I will give it "4 stars out of 5". Deducted one because of the camera, was expecting a better one with OP7 pro atleast. I am optimistic that OP will come up with a strong solution soon. üññüññ\n', '\nFirst have to give Amazon five stars for delivering this item on promised one-day delivery. Bought this phone as an replacement to my iPhone 6 (128 GB) & Coolpad note 3.

She bought for 53,000 approx; I bought for 4,000 RS less. It\'s fast, has edge to edge bigger screen; dual SIM and very long battery life. It runs PUBG as smooth as silk. Most wonderful of all is "Warp Charging". This makes my experience, just awesome.The latest update has changed cool airplane-mode animation (road appearing/disappearing). Loved that animation.The item was out for delivery@3:34PM; called the delivery man but call didn\'t go through; twice. The delivery was attempted @5:40, when no one was home. Delivery man called; I told him to re-attempt any time, same day, anytime 45min-1 Hr later. That\'s when he insisted that I collect from neighbor; I wanted it to collect in person, so I refused. He told me he\'ll deliver the next day; I refused.Through chat then in-app helpline call; was told delivery man was off duty. Then I gave an ultimatum that either the item be re- attempted or order be cancelled. Was ready to bid goodbye Amazon forever; deleting all saved cards, except the one for recovery of payment. Amazon personnel called back & resolved that deliveryman will re-attempt.Amazon really treats it\'s customers like A King. Made my experience with them awesome. This close to decision to never buying anything from Amazon again; this close to Amazon loosing a loyal customer for life. My loyalty to this brand of online shopping, became stronger due to customer- delight attitude of Amazon.Had bought a range of items from Amazon over the years; mostly electronics like headphones from leading brands like Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, etc phones like Coolpad note 3, iPhone 7, iPad 6th gen, Samsung M20, now OnePlus 7 pro. Love you Amazon. You are really A->Z (A through Z). This is the best online shopping experience ever.\n', "\nThis is my first One Plus phone hence I don't  have a baseline to judge against.Pros:1. Excellent camera quality.2. It's a beauty to look at( P.S: I bought the Nebulae Blue).3. Display is just superb.(The resolution even when set to FHD+ and refresh rate of 60Hz is class leading).4. Snapdragon 855 is the fastest Qualcomm processor as of now so no knit picking in the speed and performance aspect.5. Price is perfect for all that you are getting.6. Selfie cam is better than I expected.Cons:1. The wide angle camera is a huge let down.(I have tried the S10+ wide angle lens setup and it's not comparable with this lens).2. No USB type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter.( Another huge let down if you are used to getting earphones out of the box.)3. The QHD+ and 90Hz refresh rate drains charge fast and it's pretty obvious.4. At least a splash proof body could have been given at this price ( This is because splash proof displays and IP rated Samsung phones start around the 10 - 20K price range).\n", '\nGot this beast the next day it was on sale.The delivery was super fast though the package was just a plastic bag not much protection. Coming to the phone this phone is absolutely beast.

The curved edge to edge display gives very premium feel. Here is how it goes for performance-1. Display is bright and no problem in reading even in outdoors. Scratch resistance is impressive. I am not using any tempered glass or screenguard and I don't find any scratches till now.2. Battery is impressive and quick charge is really quick about 40-45 mins for full charge.3. Processor is best, no lag ,no hanging and no heating isuues even with heavy use.4. Audio is decently loud and clear.5. Camera is the best part of this phone. Back and front both cameras give awesome clear pictures. I will try to add few samples here and you can judge by yourself.6. Just one issue with fingerprint sensor in display and I found that on screen sensor is not as sensitive as sensors on back.\n", "\nI have bought this phone 10 days back. While the phone was in my pocket with some keys the back panel got cracked .Poor plastic quality is being used. And for the repairs if you will go to their so called EXCLUSIVE service centres you'll hardly find air to breathe. They just have 1 repair engineer who looks after all the devices .If you are spending half a lac rupees on such a gadget then it just feel as if I have thrown my money in the garbage.They dont have adequate staff to manage their repairs even.Finally i have spent another 4k on getting the new back panel which they are again claiming can break any time.GREAT SERVICE HATSS OFF!!!DONT BUY!\n", "\nJust an amazing phone... I upgraded from Redmi Y2 and trust me guys...if you are upgrading from some 10-15k phone to this one... you'll surely love this device. The display is the best thing here, 90Hz refresh rate makes it so smooth to swipe... The phone no doubt is blazing fast..no lags or whatever seen till now. Some people were complaining about Ghost Touch or Pop up camera coming out while calling, we'll I haven't seen anything like that till now. These issues are present only on a very small no. of devices, so most probably you won't get a defective one...Warp charging is brilliant. Overall I think you should go for it. Don't see those camera reviews and all....OnePlus is improving them constantly...even I got a camera improvement update too...Soo I think it's the perfect phone under 50k\n", '\nNot value for money . Bogus\n', '\nEverything is perfect except for the fact that the shipped phone was having a scratch. Came to know when I removed the pre - applied screen guard to apply the new one. Pathetic.Amazon should definitely look into it. I need a replacement. This is absolutely absurd. We spend 50+ and get this shit.\n', '\nI bought a oneplus 7pro and i was happy but oneplus doesnt provide type c to 3.5 mm jack.. i have managed by not having audio jack in phone but why didnt u give the connector in the box content.. I was vry disappointed with oneplus... I have paid 49k for a phone and i didnt get a type c to 3.5 mm jack connector!! This is vry disappointing..\n', "\nEverything is great about the phone except for a few things.1. Due to curved edged screen, touching at undesired points becomes eminent, which leads to opening apps randomly which I don't want to.2. Adobe Acrobat Reader Pro gets stuck if the file size is beyond 2 MB, even with 8 MB RAM!3. Screen guard which comes with the phone by default, is of quite poor quality. Mine got worn and torn within first 3 weeks.But apart from the above, the phone's performance, battery, camera, sound, speed - everything is just great! Despite the minor flaws, I am loving this one!\n", "\nIf there's one thing that caught my eye when my colleague bought this phone is the display. It was a stunning 2k+ Quad HD display after all. It then lead me to look for video reviews from the youtube experts. It turns out, they did appreciate the display and phone. It's amongst the best displays on a phone in recent times and it's a Samsung panel.Pros of this phone:1. Ultra smooth beautiful quad hd screen with a 90 Hertz display. It is 6.67 inches in size including the curved edges. It's great for social media,videos which can render in 1440p if available and for reading too. It also does not have a notch and you pretty much love it.2. Battery life with a 4000 MAH battery is great when you consider that you use a 90 Hz refresh vivid qhd screen. Your could switch to 60 Hz but nah. :)3. Back cameras do a good job in capturing pics. An yet to really test them. The front 16 mp pop up camera works well. It's a good camera setup.4. It's got the SD 855 processor and it's butter smooth and fast.5. With the oxygen OS, it delivers near stock Android experience. It will very soon be upgraded to 10.6. Warp charging: it's got crazy fast charging compared to op6 which I have before this and 90% will get your through the day and more.7. The on screen finger print sensor is great to use.Cons:1. It's a heavy phone at 200 grams. You will take a week to get used to it since we all are so adaptive.2. It's got a curved display with curved edges. Accidental Ghost touches do occur from time to time. Also, your need to be careful. If you drop it face down, it will fall on the screen side given its weight and with the curved edges, there is a chance to break.3. With the launch of the OP7t, One plus has diluted the significance of this phone. We Indians are price conscious and the OP 7t costs 7k lower than each of the OP 7 pro models even after prices dropped on the 7 plus pro (OP 7 pro costs 4k lesser than when launched 6 months ago).Update: just found that there's a One Plus 7t Pro launching on October 10th 2019. With it, this will be definitely be the undisputed OP Flagship.4. For the price, no type C to 3.5 mm jack connector in the box, no type C ear phones, no wireless charge, no waterproof certification but you do get a case.Verdict:If you want the great screen, FHD+ 2K+ display, 90 Hz refresh and notch less design, go for the one plus pro. If you want most of what pro has, a balanced phone, some additional features and are ok with the 2k display and notch screen design, go for One plus 7t which is a super budget flagship killer too.\n", '\nVery bad service of amazon there is no content service .There is a option to call but no one call me .Sepaker hv problem sometimes .

Polishing used on phone is also bad, after 10 days of normal usage scatches have appeared on phone not on glass back but on metal side of phone.\n', '\nOne major drawback is that you cannot make folders inside the apps screen. Whats the point in spending 60k when you cannot even organise your work. Everytime you go to apps screen , just try finding the app you are looking for.

And nw finger print , auto rotation is not working in my phone.\n", "\nFirst of all, Let's talk about Negative FirstI should say that Oneplus Copied the Design from Samsung and This truly looks like S9 or something like that, its edge Display is the worst implementation, Overall Designiis good, but coming to Screen its really annoying why Oneplus opted for this. Who want a curved display..? If some one wants they will buy a Samsung.2. Weight if the product, it's really heavy this is also may be because if copying from Samsung.3. Warp Charger, it's to make us fools, really, when Charging Oneplus 6T and 7Pro, we surely notice that warp charger is another normal oneplus charger as both charges at same speed, what's the use of warp Circuit..? Still the speed is decent enough but not satisfactory for its name.4. Popup Camera, Of course Design wise it is an asset, but if Safety of Camera Considered then Popup camera takes out the points. If course they shown some circus tricks by weighing some stone to it, but they never shown how many times the motor can handle up and down of it..? If you use face unlock, that little thing pops up minimum 50 times a day and in long run.. Can it withstand..?Here Punch Hole Display is true Winner.Now coming to positives.1. Excellent Display, if we eliminate that edge Display fi a while and feel the 90hz Fluid AMOLED Display, then we really feel the smoothness of it, just like butter, and the Delivery of saturation, whites everything is natural and with vivid option it looks astonishing.2. Both Front and Rear Cameas work like pro, front camera gives pics with over Sharpness may be issue with resolution, but after processing they are good. Coming to Rear Camera, wide angle lens are not Doing its job perfectly, may be software issue, but still Potrait or normal works great, Quality is too good.3. In screen Fingerprint works really great, fast and no need to search for sensor.4. Battery Life, With Heavy Usage, 8hrs, with Moderate Usage,16hrs, with Normal Usage, 20+ hours and I got more than 48 hours of life with Light Usage. Battery backup is Decent when we combine all the draining factors like 6.6 inch Display, In Screen Finger Print, Quad HD Display, 90hz Refresh Rate and all.5. NO need to say about Performance, 855 processor says it all.Overall, It's a beast with some Drawbacks and I personally feel Oneplus crossed its limits by pushing its flagship killer mark to Flagship Competitor, Oneplus itself bought its destruction, sooner or later its greediness to takeover the market makes it vulnerable and make it extinct, I think this is my Last Oneplus Device as surely they will go beyond 60k from next mobile.They say some Quality Comes with a price to pay..My question is why can't this be applied to Samsung and Apple when Oneplus introduced Oneplus One..?Am writing This review after using the mobile for 4 days.Thank you.\n", '\nFirst of all I am already a user of One plus 3T so i had lot of expectations from one plus 7 pro.

I hope this will be informative for you.Pros1) It looks very stylish and slightly curved display is added beauty of this mobile.2) Display/Screen is large and give ultimate movie/video Experience3) I did use the 1+ 6 earlier as well so comparison to that it\'s far better than if i compare the sound quality. it Gives 3D sound effects4) Vibration intensity is quite good5) Charging speed is good, But to get the 100% charge it takes long time6) Rear Camera is very good, But Video/Image stabilization is less than one plus 6, and slow motion video requires high lights, capturing motion object is not good. but wide image capturing and day light shots still will not disappoint you.7) Front camera here is pop up camera so according to me for the selfie you do not need to clean Everytime... so i like it personally8) Storage is enough to handle your data9) Data transfer rate via cable or Wireles is fast, But also produce heat10) Finger Print is OK, I will not say bad but its not lightening fast11) overall it\'s good product will not disappoint you when you will go for thisCons Hardware is strong but there are some software problem which i face i will mention here... its not a show stopper but One Plus need to look into this.1) If you remember one plus 6 that gives alphabet reflection  "S" on its glass panels and it was added style... but One plus 7 they didn\'t provided that kind of reflection.... i am not happy with that2) No accessories like earphones with the box3) I purchased type C bullets earphone from one plus but it is not smooth to insert and move out from type C port4) Pre applied screen protector there is bubble in curved corner.. So i think  it will not work for me for long time :(5) Now come to the software isssue- Screen Auto Brightness is not well tuned- Rotation sensors is not work well some time you need to slap the mobile to work the same :(- Rotation sensors not works for all mode of example if you are looking some file from the file manager  and you want to horizontal look into that so that will not work- Supposed you have opened the WhatsApp and suddenly call come then you will not able to who is calling and what number its you need to click on that-When call is active in SIM 1 you will not receive mesg on SIM 2 , I faced this issue many time i used to disconnect the call to get that message- When i put my mobile in pocket and when i move out from my pocket it says to many wrong or incorrect Finger attempt kind of message.. so I guess may be pocket sensors is not there or i have not enabled some settings on it- There are many other software issue i observed which i faced i dont want to make this post lengthy by this so moving next-Screen recoder should work in background, but here it gives dot symbol, So what if i want to record activity on my mobile in hidden way ? there is no option6) Cover is good fited but to charge the mobile you need to move out  the plastic cover from type C port but after using 20 days shape has changed of that and its not covering any more type C port, then why they haven\'t cut that piece which is almost unused. its very annoying to see that pieceNote : These above software issue points should not stop you to buy this product... These are minor problem that can be rectified by newer updateand i want to appriciate and wish good luck to One Plus and it\'s team for this product.

Good looking large screen - fun to use a truly full screen phone.2. Overall build of the phone is great - thought it would be too heavy (200gm) to use but it is not so.3. Battery does hold up for up to 1.5 days on a single charge (I'm a moderate user)4. Camera is decent. I currently switch between GCam and Default camera apps depending on what I'm shooting. Better to have both installed and available for your use.Cons:Again, the news holds true.1. Ghost touches: The issues reported on ghost touches does occur. But this happens only occasionally, does not bother you much.2: Weak speaker - when set to Max phone volume, it's feels less pleasant to hear. Must ensure that it is not set at full volume.3. Phone hangs/stutters when re-used after a long break. Not sure if this is android's fault or oneplus'Current verdict: This is one of the best phones out there, pricey but effective. Go for it.\n", "\nThis is absolutely the cheapest flagship phone you could get at this price point.It's positives are1. Nearly Bezelless display2. Fluid Amoled display with curved edges.3.Super Fast charging speeds (30W)4.90HZ refresh rate5. Excellent camera setup6.Great viewing angles7.UFS 3.0 supportIts negatives are1. Not a great power house due to the 90hz display and the quad hd resolutions2. Images are soft (but can be improved with some software updates)\n", "\nIf u like to play very good quality games at smoothest rate with hdr graphics and u like lot of videos u can go aheadDownside camera us good not great ,it's heavy and long in length no wireless charging and no ip ratingU can check Asus Zenfone 6z also before buying bc of value for money Asus is offering also please visit store and check the phone weight and balance if it comfortable u can go ahead else look for other options in market like one plus 7, Asus Zenfone 6z etcPerfect for hardcore gamers and one who enjoys watching Netflix or Amazon prime in hdrCall quality is very clear but network is not greatRam management is excellent and experience of one plus oxygen is is close to stock experienceU get great software updates very regularlyBattery to max 4 to 5 hours on screen time if ur very heavy userNo gorilla glass 6 it's 5 u need temper glass mustScreen quality is excellent out of boxStereo speakers are loudNo headphone jack I really miss it and sure everyone will miss\n", '\nIt\'s not the "flagship killer" OnePlus would like it to be, but each iteration gets a little closer. It remains to be seen if subsequent models will become serious competition while remaining at the same price point.As an avid fan of mobile photo/video, this phone is usable but still not quite where I would expect it to be at this price point.All in all, it\'s an okay phone for the money, but if you\'re concerned about having quality computational photography, noise-free/artifact-free video, etc, you\'re better off going with the Pixel 4 (even my pixel 2 XL takes higher quality photo/video with far lower noise and artifacting) or spending a little more for the Galaxy.If having high quality photo or video doesn\'t rank as high on your list of needs then you will very likely really enjoy this phone and for the price I would definitely recommend it.If high quality photo/video is high on your list of needs, I recommend taking a pass on this phone; It\'s definitely not for the photo/video enthusiast.\n', '\nCompletely worth for the money. Only one flaw that such a high end phone is missing wireless charging.And maybe one plus is following iPhone suite of cashing in on the USB c convertor to headphone jack which was supplied along with one plus 6t but missing in 7 pro\n', "\nGreat phone... I was planning on purchasing the OnePlus 7T pro...  But I realized there is negligible difference in both the products... And this phone is alot cheaper than the other one...So I settled for OnePlus 7 ProA great phone.... Has tons of features... And if you're a OnePlus lover then you already know that it's worth every penny....Screen looks amazing... Pop up camera works great... onscreen Fingerprint is faster than previous OnePlus devices... Camera is not the best but it can be ranked in the top 10... Definitely better than majority of Android smart phones.. a good quality product...That's the reason it's called Pro\n", "\nIt's an amazing phone. The performance is outstanding.

Apple and Samsung can't compete with one plus quality.\n", '\nforget about the teaser where oneplus7 is dropped in water. My oneplus7pro exposed to rain for 10 mins and it started flickering and screen damaged.Request all not to take that company video seriously and be careful in monsoon season avoid taking pics with such good camera\n', "\nWithout a doubt this is yet another master piece from ONE PLUS. The only thing missing, which I think should have been included is the head phone jack. There are no cables in the one plus website as well and hence I had to buy one from a different vendor.Battery life is super good. When resource intensive apps aren't used, it can easily last for a day.Camera is better than previous versions.And the best add on is the stereo speakers. The list is long. I just love everything about the phone.\n", "\nGreat phone. I wanted this phone to play pubg. It's buttery smooth! Love the haptic feedbacks, as of now it may only work for pubg. Battery life is not that good. But definitely not bad. The camera quality for a phone at this price range could have been better... Since this phone does not have 3.5 mm jack you can't charge and play. Either have to but the adapter or the One Plus Bullets. It's priced at 1,409/- which is definitely overpriced for it's slightly above average performance... I bought this phone for the display and the Snapdragon 855. If you don't mind the chin and notch you can definitely go for the Asus rog that's got better stats. But only if you're using it for gaming....\n", "\nVery nice phone OnePlus 7 ProI liked the lookI liked the cameraI liked the body colour nebula blueBattery could be better because it decreases with full features onIf you play games it will drain moreBut for normal daily use also battery is not enough at 90 hz.

This phone justifies the price of 40K. It beats the Samsung and iPhone hands down in Display and aesthetics. Camera is tad bit inferior to Iphone Pro Max and Note 10 but the difference is marginal. Normal user will find it hard to notice the difference. Night Mode has been great with the latest software on.And yes, the User experience is better than Iphone. It took all these years for and Android phone to trump Apple in that regard. 90Hz refresh rate is not a gimmick, it makes every other mobile phone 'feel' slow.Battery life is great, lasts a full day with moderate to heavy usage , even with that 4k (90Hz)  screen on. Lord knows how much it will last if it is turned down to 60hz FHD.Software is on par with iOS as far as usability and touch/feel is concerned. There is no news in  saying that  it is the fastest phone around.After the price cut it is the most affordable premium phone in the market today. Close your eyes, and go for it - you will not go wrong.\n", '\nFingerprint scanner is slower than previously used capacitive sensor. Picture quality is underachieved by oneplus. Battery drains fast even in this brand new phone. Elegance is super hot. Screen is a flagship and performs well up to the point. Changing takes more time then it was claimed , ufs3. 0 storage increases a bit of speed of data transactions. Nebula blue colour is innovative. Heptic vibration engine will feel just like an apple phone .\n', '\nIt is an average phone with a good display. Sound is good. Phone is very slippery and camera quality is poor with lacking clarity. Battery back up is average and worse than oneplus 6t. Buy op6t or op7. Do not buy op 7 pro.\n', "\n'nuff said. If you still have doubts, check the hundred or so review videos praising how good this device really is.

OnePlus7Pro.Camera quality for my device is very poor,  unclear and not up to the mark.Portrait feature is not working properly.\n", "\nPros: 2k AMOLED Display, 90 Hz refresh rate, OS, Hardware, fastest fingerprint reader, 33W fast chargerCons: camera(it's not great but not bad either considering the price point) , No wireless charging (it not much of an issue for me as the super fast charging makes up for it), No head phone jack.Note: The battery is average I would say, I'm not a gamer, for me it lasts for a day considering my usage.*Would I recommend it or not?Definitely yes, if you seeking an android phone with great display and speed this phone is definitely for you. Moreover the oxygen os is cherry on top.\n", "\nCamera is awesome. Display couldn't be any better. Processor is good. A bit big screen to handle. Finger print sometimes doesn't recognize. Very smooth to operate. Only drawback is the battery. It drains a lot for 4000 mah capacity. It will still last around 24 hours without games.\n", "\nPhone is excellent but there are some cons also which are 1) No Earphone (only Bluetooth)2) Warp charging doesn't work ... For me in 20min it charge only 35%Battery backup is also not that great while playing games.\n", "\nThe phone is good but there are too much software issues in OnePlus 7 pro feeling very bother on purchase of 7pro. This problem is not solved until the developer's team of OnePlus do something too much software issue in this device. Finally waiting for good and stable updates.\n", "\nIt was slightly better than all basic Chinese phones..like Mi note6/7 pro.. but a big miss in VOLTE CALLING /VOWIFI feature is not available even in oneplus 7pro models.. big disaapoinment at huge cost. Don't buy unless you don't want to use VOLTE or VOWIFI features..as this phone overpriced with lack of VOLTE calling features..in India..Also basic headphone jack converter should be given along with the inbox items after all we are.paying huge money.. company is not interested to give us the headphones .or wireless headphones even..I have a feeling of wasting 52,999 rupees in it.\n", "\nNothing's beats the price point OnePlus is giving. Build quality is awesome. As far as the camera concern, you better get Gcam mod. Talking about the battery life you can get two days battery if you are using your phone for recieving calls and a bit surfing. I spent whole day in tracking and shot 400 beautiful pictures of mountains covered in clouds and a few stunning slow mo videos. Even after a whole day of photography and sharing my pictures, I left with 40% of battery in my phone and that's fantastic. Just love this phone.\n", "\nI have been thinking lot about choosing this one or 7t but I needed display of OnePlus 7 pro so went with it and never had a thought of getting op 7t pro as it is way pricey and not much difference between this one and so1. Display is fantastic one of the best display I have seen ever2. Camera is not that great but it gets job done3. Battery is also on lower side as it's 90hz display consumes lot but as its charges quickly there won't be problem4. As per my usage I would say oxygen os is better than stock in many ways as it have lot and lot of customization5. It's a very minor thing - Haptic motor OMG it's just amazing you'll feel when you use it ..it's really super cool to experience while typing or navigating through gestures or receiving phone calls\n", "\nPros1.Brilliant display90Hz is just beautiful2. Super fast charging even when using the phone3. Snappy fingerprint scannerCons:1. Average battery life ~ 6-7 hrs screen on time2. Camera can be better, I've had some focus issues3. Bring back the 3.5mm Jack\n", "\nI have always been a OnePlus user and have brought 2 & 5. The 7 pro is giving me lot of trouble with performance issue. The touch screen gets frozen at times. Delayed response. I am definitely letdown with 7pro. I paid extra for just the color . Don't know how to get support on my phone issue. Heartbroken fan of OnePlus\n", '\nI was confuse between samsung s10 and one plus 7 pro...finally i bought one plus 7 pro its amazingly fast and value for money. Indisplay fingerprint is awesome its unlock within a sec. Nightscape mode is superb. Battery last a day even after heavy usage and gaming but it has no 3.5 jack and they dont even provide headphone after charging more than 50k that the only negetive thing\n', "\nDon't even buy to think waste of money phone is not even 1% splash proof, if you will have any issues with water damage than they won't consider your phone in warranty and they will let you know that your phone is not even a splash proof. Buy it if you have enough money to spend.\n", "\nWe, in family using oneplus from Gen 1 to Pro ...1, 3, 6T, 7Pro etc. ....this is true market leader and delivers like pro. iphone of Android, that's it! At a great price point.\n", '\nOverall a good mobile though the camera is not upto the mark as when we zoom into an image after clicking all of it gets mixed with the objects in the background. Though the nightscape mode and portrait mode of this phone is just great but normal camera does just a decent job. I was a big fan of OnePlus and was using OnePlus 3 before purchasing this and other than a little hardware update there is nothing much to this device. Also, its not worth the money (58k) just because of no IP rating and poor camera performance.After using for about 3 months I can rate:-Battery performance:- 4.5/5Camera:- 3/5Software:- 5/5Display:- 5/5Value for money:- 3.8/5.\n', '\nThe worst experience I ever had  since I started using mobile. With lot of expectation ordered One Plus 7 Pro,and surprisingly  received a handset  with technical issue. Mobile system was going on updating even after 3 hrs , failed.to update. Have reported the issue to customer care and they  replaced  after 2 days . Even the second mobile has the same problem. I am forced to return the same. What more I can say about my experience ..The worst ever\n', "\nAmazing screen that can rival other flagships from Apple/Samsung, but the camera could have been better. At 57,999 they could've done much better with camera quality, by far this is the only let down, hopefully a software update can fix things to an extent.\n", "\nAwesome phon from one plus ...it's great n smooth experience......I'm the  loyal customer of one plus...And connect with this company from last 4 years...Oxicision os is top class os in Android smart phone.I used one plus 7 pro from last 25 days..it's give smooth n wonderfull experience........but it's have only problem that battery life ....but it's k....it's not matter for this type of big screen n 90hz reefresh rate phone.....its...so smooth n flagship killer phone....I  already have  one plus 5 .....from last 2 years it's great..n now upgreat to one plus 7 pro....great quality from one plus....great service from amazone.....thanks a lot\n", "\nPure performance flagship killer, but not yet flagship.Excellent build quality, super screen, awesome battery backup, pure performance no lag in apps.Super fast charger best in classButAverage camera quality ( my previous were Samsung note 8 and iPhone 6 ) it not compared to anything near to my previous Samsung note 8 in image quality. I can say Samsung s10+ and s10 are real beast in camera don't forget Huawei p30 pro.Fingerprint sensor is super fast but sometimes some apps Don't show up sensor to unlock.If you are looking for camera centric smartphone go for iPhone XR or Samsung s10 series.Oneplus 7pro is best in performance\n", '\nOnce I started using one plus, I have been hooked, good value for money , this is my second exchange through Amazon portal, product meets the expectations in terms of build quality, ease of using, friendly interface,  quick charging, sufficient battery life, commendable sound and image quality.\n', "\nI am diehard fan of one plus but this time I was disappointed coz of its camera quality even..one plus 5 has better camera quality than it..  pop selfi camera is also not good ..the picture are blurred after captured...it's battery is not good as previous phones coz it's drained fastly...nd also disappointed for headphones jacks...or even in the time of unboxing u shown there are Bluetooth headset but I didn't get any headset..u should provide headset with phone when we paid 50 k...\n", '\nHave been an ardent fan of OnePlus ever since I bought my OnePlus 3. This is my 2nd product from them and have always recommended in my circle to buy their phones for the performance, value for money, and the simplicity it brings in their phone.\n', '\nIt is having the best display quality and performance-wise it is best phone in the range of 35k-50k.Front camera is not good as onplus 7 but it will be resolved after software updates. Battery drains faster while using 90Hz refresh rate but in normal use battery stands 24-36 hours. If you are planning to purchase after April-2020 then I will suggest you to buy oneplus 8.Little problematic to use face lock. The popup camera open then scan and lock will open. Pop camera is not user-friendly for face lock , this is my general point of view for the pop up camera phones. This popup camera is removed from onplus 8.\n', '\nThis is the worst product i have ever got from Amazon.i bought this on 27jan  nw display is not working nd if some one call me display stops working i called to ur executive on 6th of this month he said to format the mobile i did as he said mobile worked well for one day nd again same prblm arose nw wat i have to do nw i want u guys to help me out of this .\n', "\nMobile is excellent and display is superb... I can't find much difference between 90Hz and 60Hz refresh rate.. battery is draining Very fast ..one plus must work on it.pop up camera is awesome..for face unlock it unlocks with in a blink even we cant find the camera moving up and going inside..back camera OnePlus claims 48 MP , but images taken are same as one plus 6t cam . which is 20mp...finally one can go for one plus 7 Pro if they are affordable for 50k bucks , one who wants to enjoy popup camera..display is really super .\n", "\nThe overall performance of phone is just fantastic.Handy phone.I m using this phone since 3 months.Camera quality is awesome and the screen quality is also fabulous and the last is about battery life it last about 6-7 hours after heavy usage but 30 watt charger save our day it charge the phone 0-100% in about 90 minutes.So it's a must buy.\n", "\nIt is a good phone except that now since One Plus 7T and 7T Pro are here.

In case you need a referral, you can mail me at danschmidt4321@gmail.com or 9711382150 whatsappThe phone's 90Hz display is the main thing about it.

The nightscape mode is great as well.\n", "\nSome time Touch sensor doesn't response so advice me what to do after 11 day of purchase m facing problem .camera quality is not up to Mark standard ,don't know problem is my phone or it's a OnePlus quality standard.immidiate after purchase I request to give me seller contact details but not provided to me , Don't know why .RegardsPunit\n", '\nDisplay - 5/5Performance - 4.5/5Charging - 5/5User Interface - 4/5Sound - 4/5Camera - 4/5Fingerprint reader - 3.5/5Weight - 2/5Pop up selfie camera - 4.5/5Feel - 4.5/5Value for money - 4/5\n', '\nI am using this phone from past one month and trust me guys, one of the best phone in the market right now. Battery life is far better than my previous samsung flagship phones. Camera is good but the main thing is display. Best display in market right now. Amazing sound quality.

Didn't find any feature which is new or unique to 1+7 series.

Full charge lasted for 21 hrs only.2) Dual sim reduced functionality.3) Android 9.04) Settings very complex\n", '\nGood and speedier product, suitable for business as well as personal use. MS Office works very fine. Curved screen gives extra large viewing. Easy to hold. Original karboon back cover adds to its business-look.Battery easily lasts three days at moderate use.

Whether it's about taking pictures or watching that high-res video song is just a matter of pure indulgence. Totally in love with the 90 Hz Display that gives videos and live wallpapers an extra fluid factor. Camera quality is superb and the overall processor response is like overwhelmingly good. Initially there were some lags with opening of the camera those are not present now after the updates. Kudos to the OnePlus Team for giving a nice finish to the exterior look and overall aesthetics of the Phone. True Notch-less Experience that is worth owning.\n", "\nOverall average product for the price i paid. The disaster is internet speed is superrrrrrrr slow in this.  i was using oneplus3 previously and switched to this model now and now I can't use internet at all. Beware before buying this product.\n", '\nits a great phone in this price segment.  best display, premiums looks and built quality, the fastest phone, smoother experience, best choice for heavy gamers and for the best graphics..the only con is average berry life.. if you are a heavy user..u will have to charge twice in 24 hours..but quick Dash charge is super fast.. so if twice charging in a single day is ok then go for it..face unlock is but slower as popup camera takes time to get opened. overall its the best flagship smart phone if your budget is around 40-50k..\n', '\nPros1. Brilliant display2. Good performance...never hangedCons1. Camera: Pictures look artificial because colors are modified. Even iphone does that but the final output image on iphone is stunning.When transferred to laptop I realised picture quality is also not good enough.2. No video stabilization at 60fps.3. Microphone while video recording is poor.Never buy this phone if you priority is camera and video.\n', "\nSuper awesome product in such a cheaper price. It's my first time using android phone and have to say that one plus delivers a very premium quality in such a low price. I would everytime recommend this product to those who are thinking to buy apple or samsung smartphone, just give this phone a try it will never disappoint you. The fingerprint scanner, camera, gaming experience, movie watching experience are some of the things has always been at the top notch for me.\n"]
