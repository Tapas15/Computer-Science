Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature.

I'll tell, how it works with the Things it have..1. Oh Boy, the Display, It's Smooth as Butter.. I think it's the best thing of this Phone.. You can use it all day and It's really really Awesome. No Display and I say No Display is Smooth and Vivid as This One...2. Speed! 90Hz Display and SD 855 show it's Muscle here.. From app opening to Gaming, it does everything smoothly!3. Build Quality is Great. It feels Solid. No way it's A One Handed Device. Slightly Heavier Side.4. Warp Charge!! Yesterday at Night 11.30 pm I started Charging with 11% Battery. Within 12.35 am it's 100%. It's Blazing Fast.Now Let's Talk about some Mediocre Stuff-4. Camera! It's Ok I'd say.. Colour is slightly shifted.. I don't know Why but My Poco is Capturing Better image than this in Automatic Mode.. It's Good and like traditional One Plus Camera.. The Only Weakness!! Front Camera is good but nothing Mind-blowing Crazy..  It tends to Crop too much in Front Camera Portrait Shots.I hope One Plus implement Wide Angle Video Recording..All I can say, It's Good Phone for 52K.. Value for Money.. But Market will be Competitive in May with Asus and Redmi New Launch. So if you can, Wait for 1 Month and Compare with Other Things.But If for Display, I will Choose this Phone Anyday over Upcoming Ones.. It's Best.... I think till Samsung Note 10, the One Plus Display will be Champion in Market.I didn't talk about 3.0 UFS storage cause everyday usage you won't see much difference.And Sorry for my Poor English!\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  \"FLAGSHIP KILLER TO FLAGSHIP\"UPDATE: Editing the review after using for more than 6 months, haven\\'t faced any performance issue so far. Performance is top notch till date & now same device getting sold at 10k discount, so it\\'s good buy.----------------------------Planning to buy OnePlus 7 Pro? Here\\'s all in one review:Bought OnePlus 7 Pro in first sale, now using it from few days.Yeah! OnePlus 7 Pro priced little high.PRO\\'S:- OnePlus 7 Pro\\'s DISPLAY looks damn beautiful üòç with 6.67 inch OLED fluid Amoled 1440p display which has 90 Hz refresh rate.- It comes with pre-applied screen protector.- In display fingerprint sensor is faster than OnePlus 6T.- Warp charger charges very fast, from 0-50 in just 20 minutes.- In Fanatic mode, games can be played butter smooth.- Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.- Cam2api enabled.- Snapdragon 855 gives best performance.- Oxygen OS is BEAST, smooth, bloatware & ad-free, lag free.- UFS 3.0 helps to improve performance.CON\\'S:- Though, display looks beautiful with 90 Hz refresh rate, but because of that battery drains much faster, as result give Screen on time 4-5 hours. You can change it to 60 Hz to save battery.- Overpriced.- Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can\\'t even focus on near objects.- Device is heavy.- No IP rating, but according to few, it survives in water as well, but not tested personally üòõ.- No wireless charging.- No headphone.FINAL VERDICT:- If OnePlus 7 Pro satisfies your requirement, buy it though it\\'s little bit overpriced but still worth it.- If not 7 Pro, Samsung S10+ is also great choice.- Otherwise, if looking for low price phone, Flagship Killer 2.0 coming soon üòúNote: I\\'ll update review, after using for few days.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I completely Loved the display quality , sound quality , finger print sensor , Pop up camera, wide angle , 3x zoom and night scape camera. I disappointed a bit by not having a 3.5 mm ear phone jack. Coming to the story of battery life one plus 7 pro is 4000 milliamp which is having 9 hrs 45 minutes battery life where as one plus 6t is 3700 milliamp which is having 10 hrs battery life . I was disappointed with this too. I was totally stunned by the speediness of fingerprint sensor absolutely stunned .  I think everything is fine with the New one plus 7 pro and I am absolutely and delightfully enjoying the experience of New one plus 7 pro . Basically I am a movie lover. I am enjoying the HD movies like I am watching in movie theater. Dolby Atmos sound quality adds this phone to become high priority than others .\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Definitely worth every single Penny spent on it. The display and performance are absolutely mind blowing. Camera may not be the best but it's still top class. The phone isn't as big as people would think it is. It's actually pretty sleek and feels nice in the hands as it isn't very broad. The battery performance is commendable given the 90hz refresh rate and the QHD display. Would easily last a day on normal usage. Although, Heavy users would require around half an hour of charging. Warp charge is super fast, you won't even realise how quickly your phone charges after you plug it in. Oxygen works buttery smooth and as a first time user of this UI, I'm liking it quite a lot. Gaming is wonderful too, absolutely smooth, beautiful and lag free. The accompanying phone cover is good too, it just gets smudged by finger prints though. As someone who watched reviews of different phones and was well versed with what I was buying, I'm enjoying every second of using this phone.Most of the reviewers here are complaining about not receiving headphones and extra covers and a screen guard with bubbles, it's absolutely absurd. You should atleast look over what you're buying first thoroughly, and any reasonable man would have easily found out what he's get in the box and what he's not getting. These illiterate people buy stuff without knowing anything and then expect candies in the damn box and when they don't get it, write negative reviews which influence other queer buyers. It's highly unfortunate.For all those looking for the best performing Device available right now, go for it, if you can compromise with the headphone jack (get a 3.5mm to c type cable and problem solved). Everything from the looks and feel to the performance of the phone is amazing. You'll feel that you're holding a flagship masterpiece every second you're holding this phone. It's easily the best phone in it's price range hands down.\\n\\n\",\n",

If you're a previous OnePlus user, you won't find much of a difference.Camera - Definitely the best, in accordance with pricing.Everything else - as accurate as in the product description.My favorite retarded reviews :*Someone was upset that he couldn't find a 'OnePlus backpack' and a 'OnePlus water bottle' in the package.*Someone was upset that he found an air bubble under the phone's screen guard.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Upgraded from my OnePlus 6 just a few days back after using OnePlus 6 for about 10 months or so.Initial observation :1. QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. No notch whatsoever.3. Near Stock Android experience.4. OP is great in pushing updates regularly which is a rare thing even with Samsung\\'s flagship phones.Pro\\'s :1.  QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Near Stock Android experience with some very useful features like screen recorder, ability to switch between QHD & FHD+, etc3. Fast Charging (coutsey OPPO\\'s VOOC Charge 3).4. Good ROM options.5. ZEN mode to log you out of the smartphone for 20 minutes.6. Full screen without a notch makes video streaming a great experience.7. Apps open fast, really fast.8. Pop Up camera is really fast during face recognition. Many times you may not even notice that the POP UP camera really came out of the slot retracted. It\\'s that fast.CON\\'s :1. Battery drain gets hampered if you run it in QHD with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Camera is not up to the mark as compared to OnePlus 6 apart from the options of wide angle. (maybe software update will improve its usability, perticularly while shooting videos in wide angle).3 Camera clicks 12 MP shots in default mode. Night mode is so-so but don\\'t compare it with Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL or even with Pixel 3a XL. Pixel is way ahead in terms of resolution perticularly in night mode.4. Day time photos are much better when compared to OnePlus 6 perticularly where good light is not an issue. Photography during \"conference\" might be tricky. This is where Pixel will overshadow all other smartphones.5. This is a big phone in the territory of a tablet. Handling it might be a bit difficult for some. Single hand use is not advisable.Will update after a few more days of use.UPDATE AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF USAGE :Most of the users of OnePlus 7 Pro (as per the reviews) would be happy with budget handset like Redmi or Realme as they are either using OnePlus 7 Pro for the sake of it or to play games. Whether your handset has 2GB RAM free or not has nothing to do with the performance. What makes a difference is the availability of RAM for a perticular task. RAM management is very good like all the previous OnePlus devices.IPhone XS Max also doesn\\'t give a headset or even a dongle to use it with 3.5 mm headphone jack but people do buy iPhone without thinking twice. Iphone doesn\\'t even give fast charging brick in the box. When people can spend a lack of rupees for a brand why complain about OnePlus 7 Pro.Call quality of OP 7 Pro is good. Even video calling over Whatsapp and Skype is good.It\\'s a pleasure using OnePlus 7 Pro for creating Word documents, PPT\\'s, Excel Sheets on the go. These apps use a lot of battery and RAM. Adobe Reader is just fluid. RAM management while using these apps and switching between them is just beautiful and seamless.Will update after a few more days......As expected, OnePlus released an update on the general performance and camera issue.Camera quality is quite subjective and uncontrollable since everyone can capture an awful photo in a random scenario. Even though the photo is not quite bad technically, there is always someone giving negative opinion only for the reason that he likes more appealing photo style. Every time when there is a photo sent to us due to negative feedback, our engineers are requested to find the same light condition and object of same color and texture to simulate the photo in order to reproduce the same problem. You can imagine the time and workload needed for fixing every single problem, not to mention the dozens of photos we got from all over the world everyday. We hope you guys could understand and allow us more time keep working on the camera.ONEPLUS COMMUNITY LISTENS....\\n\\n',\n",

PEOPLE ARE YELLING ON THE APPLICATION WHICH IS BEING USED TO CHECK THE PHONE the BLANCCO. I am seriously not interested in using this phone. REFUND ME MY MONEY BACK OR ELSE SEND A NEW PHONE TO ME.

       " \"\\n\\n  OnePlus 6T was among the fastest Android ever and this time OnePlus has truly gone beyond speed to make one of the best phones of 2019.Pros-1. Display. The major pro is the damn smooth 90 Hz refresh rate along with QHD+ screen. It's as smooth as a butter!2. Ram Boost - The phone learns your behaviour like which apps you use most and accordingly allocates ram towards it making the phone even faster.3. Speed. Nothing to say about this. It's blazing fast.4. Warp charging. The phone gets charged upto 50% in about half an hour and completely in about 75 minutes.5. Completely stoked with the battery after a heavy usage of 9.5 hour screen time with playing games for 2 hours and using Netflix for 7 hours in a single charge.Cons-1. Including camera here for the time being until a major update comes our and improves the camera firmware. As of now, not a flagship camera by miles.2. Lack of IP rating, not that it matters to me. The phone's tested enough in water.3. Lack of wireless charging. Again, not felt as a con because of warp charging, but still.Conclusion: If you can wait for a while for the camera to be improved and don't mind the above cons, definitely go for it. Nebula Blue is a beauty!\\n\\n\",\n",

Is it good to take people hard earned money and become rich with all this schemes , before amazon was never like this . You can check call records even I have contacted your company executives not once but twice. Days passed and it the 16th day of this phone the phone has an issue as when I using an app like watsapp while texting it opens the profile of the person whom I am texting , plus it opens up the the other app . I don't know what problem is this . I urged your executive even that mamm I don't require the money , I would be ordering iPhone XR but then also she said a clear no . Experience WD one plus flagship phone is getting pathetic with every passing day.Regards,A genuine customer who has been using Amazon to buy online product always but this experience made me felt disgusted and pathetic.\\n\\n\",\n",

I have been to the service store they said take the back up of the phone and hand over to us. It means that ordering the device early is stupidity. Now it can happen they will open the phone and the water proof pressure will be damaged, not happy at all.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Got my hands on the first prime day sale and arrived two days later.This phone is a fresh breath of air the. The OS is silky smooth  and no lag whatsoever . One plus did an excellent job with their oxygen OS with great optimization . The 90 Hz display makes the experience much more better . You can change it to typical 60 Hz for a long lasting battery hours but who cares when you have a 90hz display. Browsing and scrolling is super smooth and playing games is a bliss thanks to the snapdragon 855 SoC . Been using it for the past two days and the battery life is good . Gets you throughout the day without excessive game play sessions and the latest UFS 3.0 provides blazing fast data transfer.  I get an average of 8 hr of screen on time with full charge and speaking of charging the latest warp charge charges the device from 40 to 100 in around 25 minutes which is fast. I am happy with the device as it is my first one plus device . Looking forward to using it for more than 2 years.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is my first ever Android phone, after being an iPhone user for over a decade. The device is superb and fast. Apps work like breeze and overall, Oxygen OS feels clean and fast like iOS. There are several stability issues that I've seen. Most notably, things like the fingerprint scanner do not always work as expected, the double tap feature doesn't always work and the curvature of the screen leads to unwanted taps. The 48Mp camera is pretty good indeed however, I've noticed an occasional focusing issue that prevents the camera from focussing correctly under certain conditions.But I guess Android phones are never perfect simply because their software is not particularly built for the hardware. So, I'm pretty cool with these issues so far, unless something escalates further. Overall, I'm very impressed by the device. Its well built, charges quickly, takes good photos, sounds well and performs well.What I'm more interested in seeing are these minor glitches go away with OTA updates as is popular in the OnePlus community. Apple has never been very responsive to minor complaints and their updates take ages to appear. OnePlus, from what I've heard is very responsive to customer complaints and I'm hoping things become better with upcoming updates.Till then I'm finding 1 - 2 star reviews on Amazon really amusing with people reporting things like a missing screen cleaning cloth, wireless headphones. Get a life people, and buy these on your own.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I felt bad only on one thing regarding the delivery of the product..I ordered the product on 16th May in early sale for prime members and it was supposed to be deliver on next day 17th May 2019 before 9 pm. But I recieved the product in Monday 20th May only..it was such a very bad experience with Amazon Becz even though I was a prime customer I recieved the product very late.. I raised many issues and complaints within that date to get the product on time. I felt very bad about the delivery service of Amazon team..Note regarding the beast and flagship of 2K19.. we happy to buy one plus product again. I was already using one plus 6 for the last 8 months. Always the one plus is so fast and good in performance and built quality. The same and with more performance and balanced Battery back up in the new one plus 7 pro. The box itself was awesome. The phone build quality is remarkable. The display is the main highlight of the product such an awesome clarity and movie experience on the phone. The fast movement with 90hz is really awesome. Felt like new whenever I use the phone. Camera quality has been improved a lot. Day time the photos are awesome and the new nightscape is also good .. The front camera is better and fast. Overall I can give 8.5/10 for camera Becz there is still some lag in picture quality and the contrast of colours while taking a picture when compared to other flagship mobiles. Next the most fastest indisplay finger print is speechless.. no lag or no delay even in extreme dark.. happy that the one plus products are always awesome and they are continuously improving the products. The battery was little bit okay for me im getting just 5 hours of screen time only. But I Hope that the upcoming updates will improve the battery life. So I can give 8/10 for battery and 10/10 for performance. The animation is also awesome whenever we open the phone through finger print the live wallpaper is remarkable. Overall I'm very much happy to buy this awesome product only I felt little bad about the price and there was no connector for earphones. The price is not too high but I expected little less. Anyways this is the new beast of 2K19. Since I won't be playing that much games so I bought 6gb variant Becz last time I bought 8gb variant it will be even more faster but drains the battery fastly. So I decided to go on with 6gb. I recommend everyone to buy this flagship killer and those who will use the phone for more personal and normal use they can easily go with 6gb variant\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I just upgraded from OnePlus 5tDisplay- the best display on any smartphone!I saw the good reviews on this mobile's display but damn! I didn't expect it to be this good!, I have a S10 in my home for comparison and I can surely say this is as good as Samsung'sBuild- I waited for nebula blue and it's worth the wait! It looks awesome, build quality is excellent but a bit hefty but manageable and u will get used to it in one dayCamera- this is the main part, I don't know whether it's due to my low expectations on camera due to all the negativity but I'm genuinely surprised with the camera, even for this I compared it with S10 and it's pretty close to S10, low light photography is a major improvement and it's on par with S10 which is considered as best in low light other than HuaweiSo don't believe all the negativity, I wonder people who are putting negative review are using DSLR for their daily photo needs.. the only negative would be the wide angle lens is not upto the mark and the one on S10 is way betterVery happy with the camera..Battery- way better than my 5t and easily getting upto 7hrs of screen on time with moderate to heavy usage and warp charge is the best!Performance- no need to say specially about performance coz it's OnePlus!855 with 90hz display, the fastest phone in the world!Others- call quality excellent, sound output via Bluetooth excellent, fingerprint sensor excellent, vibration feedback excellent, no ip rating but totally waterproof.Overall an excellent package and it's worth the premium price!Important note: 3x telephoto lens will not be active if the object is at less than 50cm distance from the lens and in very low light scenarios in such cases the main sensor is used for zoom for better quality...\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing the review after using the product for one week.1. Display & Hardware : That's probably the first thing you'll notice about the phone. There is a massive 6.67-inch screen. (too much for me). The design is rich and lusturous.There is an anti-glare coating at the back which gives a matte-like finish. The all-screen design makes the display amazing. Also, it is the first phone of the brand to offer Quad HD+ Fluid AMOLED panel. And most importantly, the screen is curved on both edges (like recent Samsung flagships).What makes the phone truly stand out is the 90Hz refresh rate. The display is also rated for HDR10+2. Camera : There's a primary 48MP f/1.6 camera backed by an 8MP telephoto lens and 16MP wide-angle shooter.The wide-angle lens offers a 117-degree field of view, and the 8MP telephoto delivers 3x optical zoom. And it is just amazing!! The camera is works amazing in daylight conditions. The night-mode is also good, but don't expect it to compete the Pixel 3 and galaxy S10s. Also, the pop up camera is an amazing addon!!3. Software : You really don't need the review for that.But few good things are- native screen recorder, OxygenOS 9.5, Fnatic Mode and Sen mode.4. Processing : The device is fast, really fast. From face recognition to 90Hz display to OxygenOS' clean interface. It is the fastest device I've ever used. (8/256 Version)5. Battery Life : The OnePlus 7 Pro has a 4000mAh battery, but because of the 90Hz display, I struggled to last it for a day. also, the  Warp Charge delivers a 30W charge. You'll be able to charge from 0-50% in just over 20 minutes, and up to 50% in 30 minutes while gaming.6. Weight : The large screen and the 4000 mAh battery leads to 206g weight. The OnePlus 7 Pro feels too top-heavy, and that makes the device unwieldy.7. Major Cons- too heavy, massive screen, no earphones included (paying 53k, I expected earphones), night mode camera is fairly average, no wireless charging, No IP rating , No 3.5 mm jack.Final verdict - I am postively biased for OnePlus always. But yes, since the price range has moved significantly, the expectations from the device have been significantly increased as well. Still this is one of the most ambitious phones, I've ever used. So, please go and buy it!.P.S. Personal review!\\n\\n\",\n",

You can bet on it. The Samsung S series like curves at vertical edges of 6.67\" large screen and no bezels gives the phone very rich looks. By far the best OnePlus till date.The 4000 mAH battery lasts throughout the day with more than average screen time but the charging is again super quick (30 to 100% in less than 20 mins)Using gestures feels awesome and gives more screen space on already a very large screen.Camera is still under testing so no comments, however initial pictures looks very good.So for a new phone I rate it 5.

All they did was a 5 minute video check where in if the phone battery drops then 5% they replace else they dont.Just go through the video and you shall understand the entire scenario.Feel as if 50k wasted.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Time for a 7 pro review, I have used for 14 days now, so after using this giving review. Let me tell you one plus 7 pro is the worlds first fastest phone. 7 pro gives you premium feel, display is unbeatable, look wise this is the most beautiful, sexiest beast till date. There are many Indian you tuber spreading negative reviews of this phone but I tell you if you really wanna decide by review then watch out side Indian you tuber videoes. Yes price of this on high side as compared to oppo Reno, redmi k20 pro but you have to decide if you want to save extra 6k to 8k or you want a premium feel of a smartphone. If yes this phone is for you, if you really want to save money then you can go for 6gb variant also comes with same features, but nebula blue is still sexiest colour. Camera is also damm good, battery life is also good, performance is best. I was one plus 5t user before having this phone so performance wise one plus is best, just go for 7 pro rather than oppo Reno or redmi k20 pro, I bet you 7 pro is the worth buy. You won't regret after buying this beast. This is the world's first fastest, sexiest phone. Just go for it....\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  No doubt regarding the phone's performance. However, the pre-applied screen protector is filled with bubbles and dust particles and seems like someone unprofessional has been applying these! I request you to please look into it and provide me with a possible solution as it has totally ruined the experience of owning a flagship and getting this kind of service!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  For one I really do like the phone...coming to details the fingerprint reader is a tiny bit slow...but it has numerous unlocking options that work simultaneously...facelock is good...zone / location based is a good feature(though it's not new) overall fingerprint does not make that much an impact.Speed is good.For screen it's very good but for a gamer the buttons on the boundaries do make it a bit difficult to operate but once you get used to it it's ok.Rear camera is very good can't say it's excellent. Front camera should have had more resolution and lighting option.Battery is good for a workhorse like this if you are a gamer expect 40% remaining battery by 3 pm. But the charger is way damn good in 20 min you are back to 90%...Headphones should have been provided, but I use wireless anyways...Tempered Screen protector should have come preapplied instead of the plastic one. mine is developing wrinkles because of gaming...OnePlus phones offer lots of customisation option if one needs and knows how....have seen lots of people not using customisation at all.Overall it's a good phone and a welcome change.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Powerfully conceived and surely is a great upgrade for those replacing a phone after 2+ years. Processor is great, audio is loud and clear. Price is on the higher end but a worthy deal for people intense on email, social media and fast communication. Miss the 3.5mm jack or the in case wired headset but battery and display makes it up. Had it been, wireless charging could have taken this far further but love the warp charging. Fast fingerprint recognition and selfie camera allows decent face recognition. Oneplus has greatly enhanced the Android underneath. Worthy call if you need speed & quality.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I am a oneplus fan (previously owned oneplus 2, 5t than 7pro) but this time I must say that OnePlus misguided about the camera, the S10's 16 MP camera produces far more better pictures than 7pro's 48 MP camera in every scenario, really disappointed with this purchase, I should have gone for the S10 instead.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  'One plus 7 pro fast, smooth and effortlessly powerful' as mentioned, or did the phone failed to live the hype. I am among those first mortals who got a chance to laid hands on this beautiful peice of technology and below are my findings after a week of use.Pros:1: Display- One of the bet that really paid off is the new edge to edge display in this phone, no bezels, no notch on the screen mean more screen to body ratio which looks quite stunning. However I am not facinated about the full screen display, I mean, yeah it's great but you can find this kinda tech in many sub premium phones available out there. The big surprise this time is the bump in resolution, the phone now sports a  6.67 Inch, 2K+ resolution OLED Display which was long needed since screen to body ratio has increased reasonably since One plus 3t and given the price tag. Another +ve side is fluid AMOLED with 90hz refresh rate, it's not cosmetic and I can say that because I am using a oneplus 3t along side this phone and I can easily see the difference in the screen response in 7pro, the animations are silky smooth, fast and flawless. Also another unique trait is this screen has got side edge display as like Samsung's edge series. All in all the display ticks all the boxes, no questions.2- Memory and storage: I am using a 12 GB ram n 256 GB rom version, given the amount of ram multitasking glitches are the things of past. I tested it's performance by parallely running nfs, pubg, asphalt nitro, clash of clans without any hiccups where as 3t faces some issues, thus heavy performance apps can run smoothly as the phone can take that all easily. Also 256 GB storage is enough to store images, vedios and files etc, given that we are living in cloud era.3 Speed: Speed has always been a trump card for oneplus  phones, and it's the imperative reason of it's existence. Even my 2 years old oneplus 3t never showed any noticeable lagg and 7 pro is no exception. Also this time the company has introduced liquid cooling to address over heating issues faced by early oneplus phones, however I still found some heating issue while playing multiple performance games but in normal day to day use it's just ok. This beast takes all performance load with ease, so stay relaxed this phone won't let you down.Cons:1: Camera: There is marginal improvement in the camera department from 6t but I didn't found anything much as mentioned in ads, I compared the shots with my friend's shots takes by s10+ and the later one stands out in terms of quality and wide view angle. S10+ camera on paper is low on megapixels but does better justice than one plus. Night pics are a slight better I can say, else Samsung's done a good job here.2 - Pop up front camera: This point may not appease to all the readers but I am not a fan of machanized camera. Even oneplus suggest not to use face unlock much. There is also another clever peice of tech here by oneplus, if accidentally the phone drops out of your grip while the the front camera is still out, the phone will automatically detect the fall by using the inbuilt gyroscope and immediately pops the camera inside even before the phone touches the ground. However given all these corks and screwes, I still doubt the front camera may show signs of break downs in the long run.3- Missing headphone jack- While there are few people complaining about missing headphone jack, I personally don't feel it's a loss as I rarely use wired earphones and also I noticed most of my friends too use Bluetooth earphones. Wired earphones are the things of the past, get yourself a pair of good Bluetooth earphones and bingo! u won't miss the jack anymore.4- Finger print scanner- Strangely the inscreen finger print scanner some time fail to recognize if you fingers are slightly moist due to sweat.Summary- Bit pricey when compared to the recently launched oneplus 7, but in terms of features and looks it's leagues ahead not just from it's own siblings but with most of the competitions as well.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I had been using my OnePlus 3T since December 2016. The device was still good enough for my daily necessities but the battery life dropped down to a considerable extent so I decided to get the OnePlus 7 Pro. My expectations were quite high, and guess what? This phone gracefully rose past all of them. Here is my review after three weeks of usage. Trust me, I've used the stuffing out of the device in these three weeks.Desirable features :1. Display : Arguably the phone's strongest selling point. My mind was shuttling between the 7T and 7 Pro and the display is what sold by. Beautiful Quad HD curved display with 90 Hz refresh rate. Curved displays may not be for everyone, but I've condoned them since the s6 edge and hence, I personally love it. Accidental touches are also very rare (I do have fat fingers). As for the refresh rate, it improves the overall user experience and if you don't believe me, keep a phone with a 60 Hz screen next to this and you will definitely observe the difference. The screen is pretty bright and has legit outdoor visibility as well. Night and reading modes also ensure you have a pleasant experience using it in the dark. Screen flickering is not noticeable for the average user but you have the DC dimming option as well if in case you do notice it.2. Software optimization : Oxygen OS is OnePlus' forte. Undisputedly the best OS available for android. It is buttery smooth and packed with just the right amount of features. I didn't feel the need for a third party launcher. Rest assured, you will definitely receive regular software updates for three years at least.3. Performance : Moving from the 3T, this felt like riding a H2R after owning a splendour all my life. I haven't noticed any lags or stutters no matter what task I threw at it. As for gaming, I've saved it for the end of the review. PUBG lovers do check out the bottom of the review for a detailed PUBG review. Spoiler alert : it outperforms even some of the gaming phones on the market today.4. Audio output : The dual stereo speakers are very loud. The clarity is excellent for listening to media and taking calls as well. Dolby Atmos is the cherry on top of the cake.5. Camera : Many reviews said that the camera was a disappointment. Well, OnePlus seems to have fixed it with numerous updates because when I got my device and installed all the updates, the camera performance was splendid. Pro mode allows you to tweak the settings considerably. Slow motion videos are good too, though not the best. Any normal user would be very happy with the camera as I had no complaints. it doesn't beauty or oversaturate images. Initially, when I opened slow motion at night in indoor lighting, the screen was flickering and so did the resulting video. But it turns out it is not a manufacturing defect. The sensor cannot shoot slow motion videos on certain lighting conditions. But it works well in outdoor lighting. So if you try it for the first time indoors, do not freak out if this happens. Video recording at 4k;60fps is awesome too.TIP : Use Pro mode to click RAW images and then edit them on Snapseed. RAW files produce excellent details but also range from 20-30 MB per image. They are a little soft but Snapseed is all you need to edit the images.6. Network reception : Network reception and Wi-Fi speed is also much better. Internet speed is much better on this phone as compared to my older devices (3T and Mi A2 lite).7. Warp charging : It charges from 0 to 100 in just about an hour's time. And the best part is, the phone doesn't heat up at all. Only the adapter gets warm, but the phone doesn't heat up despite the charging speed.8. Design - The phone looks beautiful and feels premium. The notchless display is a treat to the eyes. I have the nebula blue variant and the frosted glass back looks magnificent. It feels great to hold and even better to behold.Well, this phone does everything you expect from a phone perfectly. So the pros list would go on and on.Could be better :Battery life - OnePlus packs a 4000 maH battery. It will easily last you through the day even if you are a heavy user. I get 6-7 hours of screen on time normally and a little over 5 hours if I do a lot of gaming and YouTube. I have my display set at 9 Hz and 1440p resolution so this does pull a lot off the battery. But considering the size and weight of this phone, OnePlus could have provided us with a battery. I did try setting the screen to 60 Hz and 1080p and it improved the battery life by roughly 15-20%, but what's the point of having such a powerful display and not being able to exploit it to the fullest?Liabilities :1. No headphone jack - When I buy a premium phone, I expect the company to at least pack a type C to 3.5mm adapter, if not a type C headphones. Come on, even apple gives you compatible earphones in the box. I spent an extra 390 bucks for the adapter. It works fine but would have been better if it came in the box.2. Tempered glass - OnePlus gives you an applied screen protector with the phone and it is good, but it is not shatterproof. When you have an expensive display, it is always better to secure it with a good tempered glass. But finding a good one is a pain. Either it has black edges, doesn't cover the screen completely, or the application process is a hassle and error prone. And they cost at least four times the amount for flat screen phones. Have ordered one from glazedinc, let's hope it fits the bill.A few perks :To make the phone look better, I downloaded wallpapers from unsplash. I also installed the flight icon pack (free version). You don't need a separate launcher for it, Oxygen OS allows you to use icon packs and it is quite simple. You can customize the icons and even change the name of the apps(useful if you want to be shady).Also installed an edge screen app. Have attached a screenshot of my home screen. Also, enable dark mode. The display makes it beautiful.Set animation scale in developer options to 0.5x for an even snappier experience.I suggest you use the fingerprint scanner and avoid face unlock as the front camera has to pop up Everytime you need to unlock your phone. Besides it is very accurate and fast too. I've disabled finger unlock animation so make it seem faster (perception hack).Verdict :I have the 8GB RAM/256GB ROM version.  It is worth the 43 grand damage. Given a second chance, I'd still pick the same phone again and I am sure you would too. After all, it won the MVP award in MKBHD's smartphone awards 2019. :)PUBG Mobile review :This is an absolute beast of a phone for PUBGM. Default settings itself was set to HDR + Extreme and it handled it very well. Constant 60 fps was achieved with minor drops to 58 and never below that. I personally prefer to play at Smooth + Extreme as bullets register the fastest in these settings (as said by professional players). I'm a four finger claw + full gyroscope player. I picked up full gyro practicing for just two weeks in this phone. Touch response is super quick and there are no multi touch issues. Gyro response is also perfect and I play with the same sensitivity as Snax. My gameplay has improved a lot with this phone. Curved display wasn't an issue for me at all. You also have an in built screen recorder that records both internal and external audio. Recording your gameplay doesn't affect the performance at all. Minor heating is noticeable after two classic matches if you're recording. 5 minutes of recording at 60fps will consume close to 1GB of your storage. I can game for around 4-4.5 hours when the phone is fully charged. There is no thermal throttling and phone's performance does not drop at all. Besides, the notchless screen improves.yoir gaming experience and haptic feedback is excellent too. If you're looking for an amazing gaming performance as a bonus, this is the phone for you. The frame rate is even more consistent than ROG phone 2, second maybe only to iPhones.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Honest Review for One Plus 7 Pro :It's my first one plus phone(12GB RAM, 256GB ROM) which I bought 4 months back and I am quite happy with the design and performance of it. I will try to cover most of the positive and negative aspects of the phone.Pros :1. Speed - I have used mobile phone of every company and I must say it has the best performance ever. Apps opened in just fraction of seconds.2. Display - It has been a wonderful experience of using 90 hertz display which makes it more superior than other mobile phone displays.3. Camera - Stability of the camera is very good even you are recording video in moving vechicle.4. Notchless display - One of the coolest feature of this phone is it's full screen display without any notch which gives user an amazing experience.5. Battery - Currently, this phone has a battery back up of one and a half day. Will update it after completing 1 year.6. Fast Charging - It will take your phone to get full charge from 0 to 100 percent in just 1 hour 20 minutes. And in half an hour, it will charge your phone above 50 percent.Cons :1. Quite Heavy - As I have used number of phones I personally find it quite heavy which is due to hardware they have provided. But now I am habitual to it.2. Auto Brightness - Sometimes I feel the auto brightness feature doesn't works well. So in that case I have to manually adjust the brightness. May be oneplus can fix this issue in the upcoming software updates.3. Night mode in camera - Night mode of the camera is not that good as compared to other phones. It could be more better. May be this can also be fixed in next software update.4. Price - Upto OnePlus 6T the price of the phones were nearly 35k. This is the first phone which costs nearly 50k. Quite overpriced but value for money.5. No IP rating - Although company claims that it is water resistant but ip rating must be given by company for such a flagship phone.6. Glass panel - The phone is very slippery if you are using it without cover and back panel can easily break. Therefore, I suggest to have a good case to protect.7. No 3.5 mm jack - You have to compromise with the 3.5 mm audio jack if you want to purchase this phone. I sometimes feel there must be 3.5mm jack but then I use bluetooth earphones.To sum up, although there are number of disadvantages but still this phone is value for money. I hope this review will be helpful.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Good points:1) quality feels premium while holding it in hand2) Superb sound quality and clarity3) Awesome display to look at4) Warp charging is much more faster than Dash charging  + battery retention time is average5) 90Hz barely makes a difference as compared to OnePlus 3 I used before this. But yes, Its indeed much more refined and smooth(still doesn't justify the price tag)Bad Points:1) The camera although takes awesome pictures, but it does get blurred while zooming and viewing the pic from gallery2) The pop up mechanism makes mechanical sound while switching on/off. At this price, it bothered me. It could have been seamless.3) Bit heavy and huge. Gives a feeling of nervousness while holding it without any case(as its made of glass body)4) front camera is average. Similar to OnePlus 5T I would say(not much difference)\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Never purchase from amazon, mostly products are defective and mostly there is no refund/exchange also. Instead purchase from one plus store. Be cautioud, i'm the victim, i don't others to be.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Bought this device a month ago and during first couple of days the phone was overheating while charging. Within a few days, one plus rolled out an update and after that the issue was resolved. Speaking about the pros I would say the phone justifies its price. The look and feel of the phone is truly elegant and no words for its sleekness. Some people may find it a bit bigger, but when you are in love with tech and ready to shell out 50k on a phone, these issues are negligible.Secondly, the display is sheer beauty. It's crisp and bright, and the difference is visible!I don't use the phone like a maniac, hence I get a full day backup on a single charge. And even if you are a heavy user, still a 15 minute charge is more than enough to keep you going for next couple of hours.The sound quality is also very good, thanks to Dolby Atmos.RAM management doesn't need any discussion. One plus phones are already prominent for their RAM management.Camera quality was initially on the lower side, but one plus has rolled out an update for that and, since, the camera quality has improved a lot.Lastly, the bigger screen paves way for a comfortable gaming experience.And now about the cons:The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow than the physical scanner, but the AI will get used to your fingerprints and overtime it will automatically improve. (Faced this issue was initially, but now it is quick as a Ferrari)Absence of headphone jack means shelling out extra cash for wireless headphones.No LED notification light. You have to check your phone so as to ensure you have not missed out on something.I am not a professional reviewer but I have tried my best to include my overall experience with the phone.Conclusion: One plus has, no doubt, used 'cream of the crop' ingredients to make this beautiful piece of tech. I don't have any regrets for upgrading from OnePlus 6. After all, you have to loose certain things to gain a better one!Peace.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Overall nice phone.I bought it because I wanted a notch less and fully bazelless phone so I am happy with it though it slightly big.I personally recommend OnePlus 7 because of these reasons:-1. You can save 20 thousand rupees for same features.2. Size of the phone is more suitable and handy. OnePlus 7 pro has awkward and uncomfortable size.3. Its too heavy your wrist starts to fall when continuous usage.4.Pop up camera seems good but not reliable for long run.5. Warp charging is just a hype It takes more than 2 hours to fully charge.Some good things because of them I bought it.1. Best display with 90 Hz frame rate.2. Curved display.3. No notch.4. So basically I gave 20 thousand more for the sake of better or say best display in market right now.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The display is amazing and it just grows on you. You can never use any other handset after using this display.Battery is good for 1 and half day usage but the wrap charge is dope.Weight is a bit heavy and big screen but big phones are the call of the day so can't complain much.Design is so attractive and feels can never be backdated even after using this for 2 years.Camera specs are awesome and software is good bit with time it will improve more I am sure. Don't get me wrong it gets decent pictures and great selfies.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  OnePlus 7 Pro is a mammoth.The closest competition - the dilemma was should I go for the pro and pay 53k or the standard version and be done within 35k or so. Both have the same heart and soul. However, a waterdrop camera is a weird prospect. That, and only that made me choose the Pro. But when I got the Pro, I realised that the screen that came with it was just fabulous. I have never seen something like this and I will not see this in any other phone this year.The real flagship - Now that I am ready to shell 53k, it made sense to rather weigh the alternatives. S10 is the obvious answer but that punch hole is a turnoff for me. And again of all the features that S10 has that the OnePlus 7 Pro lacks, headphone jack is the only one I miss. Oh, and did I tell you about the screen on the Pro.... It's gorgeous!The backroom - I have always believed that a product is a reflection of how the company thinks. Behind every great product is a group with high standard of ethics, skills and the never settle attitude. Beside Apple, I have found that in this time (June 2019) companies like OnePlus and Honor (Huawei) are frontrunners in their products as well as their vision. So go for their products. Honor does have better camera.The new OnePlus 7 Pro lacks in camera. It's the only area it lacks in. But I see promise in the brand and future updates will make it better. I believe it. The battery drains faster when you play video games or watch videos. I found my screen on time to be close to 5.5 hrs with 16% battery remaining. 20% of the time was spent on PUBG, 15% on Google Play services and a combined 20%+ on videos. I found it quite underwhelming. However, once you take a break from your phone and go for lunch or a bath, you will be surprised to see how fact it charges. 0-100 in an hour. In fact plug it in for 15mins and you will see a 30% increase in charge.Everything else works like a charm. The fingerprint sensor is great. The first few times will be erratic but then it gets accustomed to the user. Works fine from there.The sound quality is almost great. It is loud but I wished that it was a tad bit better.The Oxygen OS is doing its job as we speak. It is so natural that you might not just feel that it's not stock Android. It's very close it the stock. And it's nothing extravagant. Oxygen OS is just right...Overall, rating hereBuild 9/10 just for the lack of official IP rating.Camera 7/10 I have taken better pics from phones that cost half. Pop up camera is good.Display 10/10 can't explain why. You need to see for yourself.Charging 9/10 This thing is a monster with Warp charger. And I don't need the wireless charging.Processor 9/10 Blazing fast. Took away a point because there is always room for improvement.Value for money 8/10 the phone is great but the camera could be better. As a user, I am very satisfied. I would rather hold OnePlus 7 Pro than the Samsung S10+.Nominating the Pro for the best smartphone of 2019.Enjoy your shopping!\\n\\n\",\n",

In 4gb ram it runs fine i have played PUBG in it for year long and never ever it said restarted . I found divice is beat underrated. If you are planning for same features go for it. Now LG v30 plus comes in 25 k . May be you can plan buy LG V40 plus in latest in OP7PRO budget with better features .Phone start working on itself.Finger sensor works only if you press rightly and tightly fingerprint sensor sucks compare to other flagship phone I will not recommend OP7 Pro.Wasted 50k.\\n\\n\",\n",

(Not for photography enthusiasts).One of the best refresh rates. Makes the entire experience of using the phone seamless.The screen quality is amazing.The phone feels well built and almost premium quality.No NOTCHThe OS is one of the best I've used. Closer to the original android.Curved screen and 90 GHz refresh rate make it the best phone around for video viewing.Unbelievably Fast ChargingCons:The camera is not at the level of other flagships.

       " \"\\n\\n  I brought it 5 days ago and lots of thinking between S10 then gone for this one. Sinse last 6 years I am using Samsung S series and still have my S8 as my secondary backup phone. No doubt the phone is good, fast, speedy, great display. I am not regret as its best value for money when hardware, performance and price considered. All these below points are just I dont like, there are lots of other things which I like as well.1. The phone is heavy and big. 207gram feels like a brick. If you fill-up a phone with features but still form factor is not practical use then this is a fail. UFS 3.0 storage only have write speed of 229MB/S, this is lower than some phones with UFS2.1 example: S10. The phone design is common and looks just like other Mi, Vivo Oppo phones. No X factor. In my view its a premium Chinese phone.2. Camera is a myth. Sony IMX586 is a failed and over hiped sensor in its era. Now a days used in mid range Chinese phones. I wish OnePlus should have skipped this one. If camera in a phone is your primary requirement then keep away from this. I love photography and have my DSLR for that so I dont trust any phone camera or that was not a concern for me. I have tested in all conditions and sorry to say this is a bad camera for a flagship. Front camera is good enough and I like it including its design. I recommed that please turn of scene recognition, auto HDR in camera settings menu to click at least some good pictures in day light. For night or dark light camara is good I believe. I assumed that the developer team put their entire efforts to bring a camera which can provide good photos in night and forget that we take most of the photos in day light. So those night calibrated auto settings will ruin your daylight photos. But still even if you try to get best shots, its far behind Apple and Samsung Cameras.3. Oxygen OS is good and fast I am using 1st time, but it doesn't have native apps like Email Client, Music Player, Payment App, Security App, Calendar, Contact, Phone Call and so many others. For all these it's depending on stock Android. Now you say whats a big deal? Apps are available in playstore for free to download. But I think those free application are comes with lots of advertisements, notification and even Google native apps track you for their add selling. I use yahoo mail, why I will pay yahoo 350 rupees monthly to use their email client. Another thing I noticed that Home bar doesn't auto hide during keyboard popup so I accidentally click the home key many times during type and suddenly go to home screen. That is a big drawback. The home bar should be hide during type. OnePlus please look that simple but very useful stuff.Rest assured, I also agree with others that its an insanely fast phone. Battery is best in class as per my use. This is a good phone and would be best if Oneplus taken care of some useful requirements. A great Display and good hardware will not certify a phone as a flagship. There are lots of other aspects need to be considered. This phone doesn't fulfilled my criteria of a flagship however personal choices may be different by individuals.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is my first phone in the premium category and I'm glad I went ahead with investing those extra 20000 rupees for a phone. 12 GB of RAM will look after every thing that you can ever ask of a phone. I had no idea of what difference a screen of 90Hz refresh rate or 60Hz meant. But after using this phone and having seen my friend's 6T I can say that a 90 Hz screen is so buttery smooth that it spoils you. Fingerprint scanner has gotten better with every touch. Battery performance isn't too great but it does charge lighting quick. The curved screen and the Fluid Amoled Display just packs that final punch.It's not always we think of going for a 50k+ phone and if you're thinking of upgrading your phone and have the budget, go for OP7Pro without any apprehensions.Edit: I'm no pro photograper but the camera seems to be better with additional features after the Android 10 update.\\n\\n\",\n",

Soo smooth(90hz refresh rate is a killer one).Camera is pretty good than the other mid-range phones (15 to 25k).Battery performance is nice. got full day(morning 9am to night 11pm) battery with single charge. (Since it is a new phone im spending more time with it, still battery is preforming nicely. im getting up to 7 hrs for screen usage time, with regular usage of whatsapp, instagram, facebook, insthorts, camera, photos, google news, Pubg(2 rounds), youtube (up to 30 mins), phones call of upto 20 mins) - Refresh rate - 90hz.\\n\\n',\n",

Which OnePlus should have given in this pricerange.Hiving 5 stars on the basis of using ohone for 3 days.Worth it.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This was a great deal offered by Amazon. The phone quality is top notch. 90hz screen refresh rate gives a buttery smooth experience while using the apps which support it. In-display fingerprint reader is relatively fast and accurate. Haptics is improved and precise but not as good as iPhone which is a lot more expensive.Battery life is not awesome but decent as it drains out faster when the phone is used heavily while playing games. Although the warp charging does really help out here. The phone charges upto 50% in under 20 mins. This 50% lasts quite a while when used judiciously.Camera quality is decent again. Photos come out crystal clear and sharp in good lighting. Night photos are not very clear and have a lot of grain. Inbuilt night mode provides a brighter image but still there's grain visible in the photos. Selfie camera is also good. There is the motor noise when the selfie camera pops up and down. I dont recommend using the pop up camera for unlocking the phone.Considering the price, I would recommend this phone to anyone with this budget. This is 2019's best phone afterall.\\n\\n\",\n",

I tried buying it on the OnePlus official website but it is out of stock.The 90Hz refresh rate and everything else about this phone is fantastic.I bought the 12GB variant and I guess it is completely worth, since it gives a tough competition to premium flagships of Samsung and Apple.I play a lot of video games and I find this phone perfect for a person like me.While playing heavy-duty games like PUBG or Fortnite, the battery drains a bit fast but you can charge it from 0-100 in an hour.The screen is really huge, and because of its features I guess the phone weighs a bit more than other phones do.I would definitely recommend buying this phone to my friends or colleagues.\\n\\n\",\n",

The case that comes with this is slippery so better to buy a new one. I'm looking for one now too.5. The battery seems to go down a little faster to my liking with the 90Hz on.

If we are buying the phone of 50000, the company cant even provide us the connector for earphone? I would suggest not to go for this phone until and unless they have a solution for this. Before buying this phone just think why didn't they provide Type C earphone or connector. If we are spending more than 30K on any phone. We expect all accessories for the same.\\n\\n\",\n",

I live in tier 3 city and the phone was scheduled to be delivered the very next day. Such super fast delivery has never been heard. I was able to reschedule the delivery date easily on chat with customer care executive. Excellent.. Pros .1. Outstanding display. The quality of the display can not be told in words . It has to be experienced to feel.2. Camera quality. The default 12MP pics are sharp and feel life like. The 48MP in Pro mode is somey out of this world.3. Battery. The 4000 mAh battery is more than enough for a normal user ever at QHD and 90 refresh rate. If you need to last longer, just reduce the screen resolution. The battery was 67% when I received the phone. Even after 1 system update install, 20 app updates from playstore, and setting up the entire phone, the battery stands at 31% after 17 hrs of starting the phone for first time. Great.4. Hardware. The SD855 is more than sufficient for most users while perfect suited for a heavy user.5. Warp charger supplied with phone.6. Thick transparent cover supplied and has cuts at right places which don't obstruct the moving front camera.Cons1. Pricey.2. The pre applied screen protector is good for nothing. It already had bubbles in it and within 6hrs of receiving, it had worked loose from all 4 corners. It won't last long and will surely peel off soon.3. Nothing supplied. At 53k, leave a wireless headphone, it doesn't ships with even a wired headphone.4. Packaging could've been better while shipping a 53k phone. Even a 200 Rs phone cover has better packing. No bubble wrap to prevent jerks and shocks. Just a Amazon branded cardboard and nothing else.Desired.1. Wish it had shipped with a wireless headphone.2. A pre applied 3d tempered glass for better protection.Update. All this is rubbish. The phone has developed a fine green line at the edge of display and within 4 months of purchase, the display nuas to be changed. And as always, service center terms this as physical damage and refuses to honor warranty.Never ever buying OnePlus. Even a phone worth 4000 doesn't has problems in 4 months.\\n\\n\",\n",

The bezel less screen sometimes makes it hard to use gesture navigation. Besides this there is literally nothing to complain about. The phone is incredibly fast, the display is incredibly satisfying, the camera is great even if it isn't the absolute best, and the UI is brilliant.Recommend to anyone looking for a phone in this price range if one handed use is not a big concern.\\n\\n\",\n",

I love playing PUBG and Asphalt 9 on Top setting and Result are terrific.2) Portrait Mode - OnePlus has never been the Best Camera device in market but OnePlus7pro has one top notch portrait mode. You will love taking Portrait in this device.3) Speed - With Latest 855 Snapdragon , I never laid hands on such smooth Android device . I can directly compare smoothness to IphoneX on this device.4) Built Quality - OnePlus 7 Pro has very strong built quality which I found very impressive. I did checked out YouTube videos to found its durability and was impressed.5) OxygenOS: With OxygenOS the experience of Android is smooth as silk.Cons :Water Proof : Only reason to not buy this mammoth phone . I was planning Huawei P30 Pro but then we have water proof cases for that purpose.Fingerprint Sensor : It does seems temperamental at times .Headphones : No Headphone Provided with devices and No Headphone Jack . Seriously heavy disappointment.Wireless Charging : Wireless Charging is a show off feature. We all know it's very slow but it does look good to flaunt.Weight : If you don't prefer Heavy phones , let this go . ONEPLUS 7pro is 200 gms and definitely feels heavy . Though I found  myself attracted to heavy phones .Review : If Best camera is priority  and you do tend to take underwater photography seriously, Spend 20K Extra for Huawei P30 Pro.OnePlus 7pro has a great camera , it's 3x zoom and bokeh is awesome . And is a great device , if you are looking for Good Camera , Super Cool Build and Best Performance.Speed is what OnePlus were really always selling here.

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using OP7 Pro for last 7 days and I found performance of the phone, camera, battery live up to OP expectations until 7th days.  I witnessed a song app is playing music even after I killed all the process. As last step, I restarted the phone and to my surprise phone got stuck at restart for a minute or so without doing anything. After couple of minutes, I see screen going blank and photo just died. It won't start whatever you do. I finally found that this is a happening to many OP7 Pro phones and way to recover is pressing Power and Volume up key.Overall very disappointed . This has made me think if we should even trust and buy any more OP phone at all.I also found that once you purchase a phone through Amazon, it is not easy to return a defective phone. Even if you are still within 10 day return window, you cannot just ask for a replacement for defective phone. You have to spend good amount of time with Amazon customer service who will get a technician to visit you and find all ways not to accept the return which is very disappointing.So, firstly it is good to avoid this model till OP fixes this issue. If you still want to buy it, better buy it from retain stores and not online because you will be stuck with this product even if you don't want to.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This is my personal review after 2 days of usage and one thing is for sure , that this is the BEST DISPLAY ever, just like said at the event \"FAST AND SMOOTH\". Watching series/movies is a pleasing experience and hands on to One plus for that.The performance is smooth and amazingly fast as always with OP. They are Masters in this segment.I saw many comments on social media regarding the average battery backup, yes it is true but with WARP CHARGING it doesn\\'t really matters. It is more than a balance to me. I won\\'t mind burning more battery for a smoother experience which is new and missing with other brands.The biggest drawback I felt is the Camera. The pop up camera has got too much crop and if you open the video then you might end up shooting yourself only. The Rear camera too needs some optimisation which I am sure we will see soon.One thing which I want to bring in notice is the \"NIGHTSCAPE\" mode in Rear camera, it was working good before the first update and as soon I updated it , the quality went down. Same is with the normal one as well.One thing I felt which should have been given is the Type-C to 3.5mm jack cable, that was indeed missing. Rest everything is just perfect.Overall I will give it \"4 stars out of 5\". Deducted one because of the camera, was expecting a better one with OP7 pro atleast. I am optimistic that OP will come up with a strong solution soon. üññüññ\\n\\n',\n",

Snapdragon 855 is the fastest Qualcomm processor as of now so no knit picking in the speed and performance aspect.5. Price is perfect for all that you are getting.6.

No USB type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter.( Another huge let down if you are used to getting earphones out of the box.)3. The QHD+ and 90Hz refresh rate drains charge fast and it's pretty obvious.4.

If you have money to spend, don't hesitate and go for it.\\n\\n\",\n",

But after i removed the protector after 2 weeks, i knew the pixels are not working. I cannot attach screen shot because it wont show up on it since its the hardware problem. It is really annoying.

It is much quicker now.And quick pay is nor quich launch and we can set a no. of apps from which we can choose what to open which long pressing fingerprint rrader which unlocking and swiping to select app after unlock like paytm scan, phonepe scan etcCamera is another plus.The quality is great and telephoto is cool but needs improvement thought which is easily possible via software updates.Battery life what is get is arount 6 or 6 and a half hrs screen on time with quad hd resolution with 90hz. Yes both this settings will take a lot of battery but 6 6 and a half hrs for this setting is not bad. If we turn doen to 60 hz we might net few extra hrs but believe me one you are in 90hz it doesn't feel like going back to that laggy experienceOverall a totally worth mobile for the pricetag given by oneplus is is still a lot cheaper that what other companis might have offered.\\n\\n\",\n",

I suppose the high rate is because of its IP rating .To the product review it's simply the best feel you have while using this. Cameras offer crisp and natural colours, sensons are too good.

Camera: Camera quality is superb and I personally feel is at par with iPhone XI and outdoes iPhone in several conditions3. Battery: It offers a superb battery back-up lasting whole day without heavy usage. Even with the heavy usage the battery drain is quite slowCons: None so far.I know One Plus 8 is around the corner but if you're a fan of full screen display then One Plus 7 Pro is a go to phone, because speculations are rife that One Plus 8 will feature a punch hole display which I personally feel is a step back.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  If there's one thing that caught my eye when my colleague bought this phone is the display. It was a stunning 2k+ Quad HD display after all. It then lead me to look for video reviews from the youtube experts. It turns out, they did appreciate the display and phone. It's amongst the best displays on a phone in recent times and it's a Samsung panel.Pros of this phone:1. Ultra smooth beautiful quad hd screen with a 90 Hertz display. It is 6.67 inches in size including the curved edges. It's great for social media,videos which can render in 1440p if available and for reading too. It also does not have a notch and you pretty much love it.2. Battery life with a 4000 MAH battery is great when you consider that you use a 90 Hz refresh vivid qhd screen. Your could switch to 60 Hz but nah. :)3. Back cameras do a good job in capturing pics. An yet to really test them. The front 16 mp pop up camera works well. It's a good camera setup.4. It's got the SD 855 processor and it's butter smooth and fast.5. With the oxygen OS, it delivers near stock Android experience. It will very soon be upgraded to 10.6. Warp charging: it's got crazy fast charging compared to op6 which I have before this and 90% will get your through the day and more.7. The on screen finger print sensor is great to use.Cons:1. It's a heavy phone at 200 grams. You will take a week to get used to it since we all are so adaptive.2. It's got a curved display with curved edges. Accidental Ghost touches do occur from time to time. Also, your need to be careful. If you drop it face down, it will fall on the screen side given its weight and with the curved edges, there is a chance to break.3. With the launch of the OP7t, One plus has diluted the significance of this phone. We Indians are price conscious and the OP 7t costs 7k lower than each of the OP 7 pro models even after prices dropped on the 7 plus pro (OP 7 pro costs 4k lesser than when launched 6 months ago).Update: just found that there's a One Plus 7t Pro launching on October 10th 2019. With it, this will be definitely be the undisputed OP Flagship.4. For the price, no type C to 3.5 mm jack connector in the box, no type C ear phones, no wireless charge, no waterproof certification but you do get a case.Verdict:If you want the great screen, FHD+ 2K+ display, 90 Hz refresh and notch less design, go for the one plus pro. If you want most of what pro has, a balanced phone, some additional features and are ok with the 2k display and notch screen design, go for One plus 7t which is a super budget flagship killer too.\\n\\n\",\n",

Within three weeks, OnePlus has send more than three updates centered on the camera and it gets better and better. Photos are sharp, colors a bit vibrant but I love it, video quality is better than any phone. Portraits are somewhat average, but that is true for any smartphone. Selfies too are of very good quality, and support nightscape.In very low light (almost pitch black with a few lights in the distance) the phone performed better than my expectations but I rarely use it for such situations. In normal low light (clubs, dimly lit rooms) it performs very well. I have attached a lot of camera samples. The best part about the OnePlus 7 Pro is the sharp quad HD display and with the 90Hz display, you can't stop just scrolling through your phone because it's so smooth and addictive. Everything from 4k videos to just the wallpapers look mesmerizing on this phone. The chin of the phone is also almost non existent, like the iPhone X.The fingerprint reader is very fast but takes more than one try with wet hands.The battery lasted much longer than the reviews said, easily finishing one day (and more than one with moderate usage and the battery saver turned on).The performance is just mind-numbingly fast. I realised its importance while opening PayTm which would always open slowly on my previous phone. No lag whatsoever.OxygenOS is a big reason to consider this phone because it is much better than the OneUI or Oppo/Vivo's wierd UIs.The only complaint I have is that OnePlus did not include a headphone jack converter in the box and the official converter on their website is out of stock. I tried a few cheap converters but sound quality was very bad. This is a trick for me to buy their new Bluetooth earphones WHICH I WILL NOT.Anyway the speaker quality is very very rich and good with Dolby Atmos so I can manage till I buy a pair of other Bluetooth earphones.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I bought the phone on 4 March 2020. This is the worst phone I have ever bought. Even though there are few good things such as display, camera but bat things out number good things. I have been facing many problems after 3 weeks of the purchase of phone.Problems I have been facing:1. My phone gets switched off when I recieve a call.  I have never heard this problem and never faced this  problem before. Also worst thing is I won't know who  called me after I switch on my phone.2. Battery life:  When I recieved this phone, I was very happy with the  battery life. But after 6 weeks of usage, I have been  facing issues wirh the battery. For 2 hours usage of  Netflix, the battery consumption increased to 25-28  percent from 18-20 percent.3. Lagging:  I always keep my system up to date with system  updates. But sometimes my phone lags as if it has been  used for 2 years.4. OnePlus customer service:  I have contacted OnePlus customer service several  times, but none were able to solve my issues.At first I was very happy while I was using my phone, but now all I do is worry when I use my phone.I hope OnePlus will solve my phone problems. I would be very happy if OnePlus acknowledges my message.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  One plus is nothing more than a social media hype, the phone are generally coming with minor defects. I first ordered this and fingerprint reader came with defect after which I followed with amazon badly but got poor response. The phone was replaced in close to 7 days of time, the second phone also came with defect and it is heating up even over 45 degree while in normal usage and now it is a pain. Moreover amazon have very bad support on this. Polishing used on phone is also bad, after 10 days of normal usage scatches have appeared on phone not on glass back but on metal side of phone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The screen size and viewing has just spoiled me.The bezeless screen with curved display is really to die for. I don't know if I can ever go back from this screen to any other device now.The processing speed is really really good.It doesn't slow down when it is dying in battery or if 4-5 apps are running in parallel. Processing is just flawless.When I was buying this phone, I was continuously told that camera is something u won't like. However, to my surprise till now the images taken are just amazing.Really love the portrait mode and wide angle feature on this. So amazing.Overall mobile feels really premium in your hands.Must recommended buy if this comes under your budget.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using this phone for almost 7months now, I upgraded from Nexus 6P and this is my first oneplus phone.The screen is excellent and it is the biggest USP of this phone. It is a breeze to use this phone, UI is uncluttered and minimalist.However, the worst part of this phone is FINGERPRINT SCANNER which ruins the entire experience of using the phone. They snapped on a half baked technology called optical fingerprint scanner, more than 50% time it doesn't work. I tried multiple times deleting and enrolling again, it did not improve. It is not that it doesn't work but it is unpredictable when it won't work. Imagine you try to unlock the phone using finger and it doesn't work on repeated attempts and you have to finally enter the PIN to unlock the phone. Imagine having this repeat 15-20 times a day !! All this with a clean thumb, if you got wee bit of dust or dirt on your finger, just forget it !!. For example, after you open your car door and get in, I can guarantee that the phone unlock wont work, a little bit of dust on the door handle is enough to kill this. I am truly frustrated with this, my nexus 6P had physical scanner on the back and it never failed; instant unlock every single time, may be it didn't work once in a million attempts.To circumvent this problem, I can't use face unlock either! because this has got a pop up camera that needs to pop up do a face unlock, the phone throws a warning if you retract the pop up camera a few times. I originally intended to keep the phone for 3 years but now I am so frustrated that I am looking to move to a Samsung or something better.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  So been using it for a week and a half or so ,here's the layman review the kind I would've wanted to read here in the review sectionPro's-SCREEN- so good you'll find it hard to keep the phone away from you for even a little while .It's butter like crazy smooth.DISPLAY- be it qhd or fhd things are way above par a premium experience warm and subtle bright colors soothe your eyes enhanced by the resolution options offered by the phone . It's 'For your eyes only '.CHARGE- it's 'warping' fast I charge my phone at 5% mark and 30 minutes later it is 65 % so the One plus did good on the promise . The brick is beast of a charging plug.REFRESH RATE - ITS 90 Hz or nothing that's how fantastic that refresh is . 60Hz doesn't disappoint either  , the difference between the two is not too much but you definitely feel surfing a wave while sliding down and up it'll be a whole new time pass .lolCAMERA- nightscape mode and normal photo mode are super cool crisp and subtle pics to impress anyone . The pop up selfie camera gives a clean and cool selfie . So pop it like you work itOthers- no heating issues did play pubg on 90 Hz and qhd lasted me 3.5 hrs on what was the best pubg experience thus far . The only reason i reinstalled pubg after quitting it last year was to check the limits of the specs offered by the phone and it superceded it in everyway possibleCONS-BATTERY- 90 Hz and qhd will take a toll on your phone .battery life is disappointing kind of but given high end specs you get at this price plus the warp charge I think the company made its warp charging knowing that .With high end spec it lasts about 4-5 hrs extensive use like gamingWith 90hz and fhd about 5-6 he extensive to moderate use .60 hz and fhd -5-7.5 hrs with extensive to moderate useHANDLING-depends on your hands me being a 6'3 didn't find it difficult at all.CAMERA- even after the update the portrait mode is disappointing depth effect has played a spoil sport .NO DONGLE(SCREW YOU ONE PLIS FOR THAT ;). )NO HEADPHONE JACK (DOUBLE SCREW YOU)Overall go for it just the best experience this flagship has to offer in range of 49k to 53 k .NOTE - DO NOT REMOVE THE GLASS ON THE SCREEN THAT IS THERE BY DEFAULT IT IS THE BEST ONE YOU'VE GOT FOR A LONG WHILE WILL DO JUSTICE\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Do not peel off original screen protector that comes with phone.. reason is currently no screen guards are available and most of glass screen protectors dont work..Rest of the things as you already know.One less star because I received the piece with one noticeable scratch on the screen.Over all worth buying for sure.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Where do i start! Ok one week down the lane, this phone to begin with looks spectacular, atleast from the screen and display point of view i dont know what could better this now. Next up, The 90hz refresh rate makes your phone feel buttery and you will love it(comes at a negotiable cost of reduced battery life) . It\\'s alright though since it\\'s powered with a WARP charger that works like a charm. Talking about cameras now, pop-up camera adds to the elligence of this phone. The picture qulities are stunning at times. I have tried macro photo graphy with this one and the details it can catch are just terrific to believe. 4k recording is excellent, stability is alright!! At this price (42k) it\\'s almost unreal as to what this phone has to offer. Nebula blue color makes this gadget look like out of this planet. Let\\'s not even get into specification. Because it\\'s all just \"beyond the speed\". One amazing product!!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is my first OnePlus DeviceAnd I can say this is the best phone I have ever used .The 90hz display is amazingI can guarantee once you started using the phone on 90hz you can't go back to lower refresh rate.. you will feel and can see the other phones lagging..Camera is not up to the mark but the latest update improve a lot .. and can be better in next updates..Battery life is good ... Not the best due to higher refresh rate and quad hd resolution.. but if you want good battery life you can do so by changing the screen resolution to full HD+ and the refresh rate to 60hz..The fingerprint is super fast..And the WARP Charge , this is amazing..The phone charges very quickly..Oxygen Os is awsm.. (best os ever)Weight - the phone is a lit bit heavy.. but if you use the case you wont feel it heavy..\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Pro & Cons for One Plus 7Pro:-Pros:1. I am a great fan of One Plus and i have been using one plus5 from last 2 year so there is no question of phone getting lagging issue or anything like that, but when i received my One Plus 7Pro lagging word is simply unavailable in my dictionary.2. About fingerprint scanner it is quiet good but just hopping to be little faster, (Personal opinion) may be it is because of on display scanner some micro seconds delayed would be there.3. Popup camera is best in class, face recognition is simply awesome.4. Battery backup is ok you get whole-day utilization time if you are a frequent user.5. Last thing the built quality & design is simply awesome. One has to be only careful for accidentally dropping on backside & on display corners because of it curve display.Cons:-1. No headphone jack 3.5mm one has to buy c-type converter or c-type headphone.2. Its very difficult to put tempered glass for curve screen mobiles i have tried twice perfect fitting is impossible.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Let's start with the first thing that you would notice - size.It's a big phone, yeah. But, after 2 weeks you won't notice. It will feel just perfect in hand (if you don't use a cover on this). With a cover, it's still alright. And yeah, I've been using Galaxy S7 and Lg G7, meaning small phones, always. So yeah, size won't bother you and it feels as premium as a phone can get.Next, Display - I compared the display to S10, S10 Plus, Note 9, Pixel, iPhone. I love this display in every aspect. Everything will always look better. Maybe because of the larger size or actual display quality, I don't know. It's the best I've had. Outdoor visibility is a little less (only when you compare with others), but it will get the job done easily.Battery - Do not go through online review. It'll last a full day easily on heavy use. I'm getting a day and a half - 4 hrs Sot with 32-38 hrs or 7+ hours sot on weekends with a 18-22 hrs standby. Even it doesn't; You won't ever feel it. Charges in no time, Doesn't heats up while charging (even when you're using it). It's getting better after each day.Camera - Again, getting better after each update. I'm on android 10 open beta preview and you get all the features that you want. Every function enabled on each sensor. Default setting is great, detailed images, perfect balance. And, when you want to tweak, Pro mode is there. You don't need anything else when it comes to cameras. Btw, when comparing the pictures between S10 and 7 Pro, you'll like the 7 pro just cause of the display.Performance - Do I really need to review this? Just cut the animation scale to 0.5x in developer mode and it feels crazy. Not a single hiccup so far. This is the best performer in the industry.You won't get better experience than this. You may buy other flagships because you though the camers might be better or battery or blah blah. This the best thing in the market right now. Or, just wait for the 7T pro. 1 months maybe. Best thing ever.But, get a framless cover for 500, it will maintain the sleek feel of the phone. Don't try any uv screenguards, they are horrible. Use the stock screenguard or simple protectors.Cheers!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The phone is super amazing.. It is a little heavy compared to other models from One Plus but that's not a complaint as the phone is real fast with great and simple features.. The finger print scanner is not that great as most of the times I have to input my password due to lockage from trying several times. I think they need to work a lot on this.. Camera quality is super good and even the night pictures turn out to be fabulous.Has a great battery life.. Based on my usage I'm getting around 12-15 hours.. But I need not to worry as the phone charges super quick.!Initially there were a few call drops but I think the issue is fine now..The best part about the phone is it's speakers! Dolby surround is just out of the World and you get a theater experience while watching videos or even music for that matter..OnePlus could have provided some basic headphones with this phone as it does not have a jack.. But i think you can get a good wireless headphone for around 2000 which will solve your problem..\\n\\n\",\n",

I couldn't even share pics via WhatsApp cuz it started to load the pic forever! Still my hands are heating.. Never ever buy this crap.. go for a Samsung seriously.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Was waiting for a good deal on S10, meanwhile OP7Pro was launched so I bought it on the first day it started selling, Amazon delivered the same day. Great service. I received and installed 2 updates, and having used it for a week plus, I can say it's been a mixed experience. Some features work well, others dont. So here's my impression for you.Good:1. Large and sharp LED screen with good legibility. Watching videos is fun. The on screen FP sensor is fast and conveniently located, no delays or misses.2. Dual speakers with clear sound, though music quality through speakers is just about OK.3. Fast and zippy, be it apps, games or file transfers. Doesnt get hot while playing games or charging4. Really fast charging. Fully charged in an hour!5. Oxygen OS is minimal and easy to use. The popup selfie camera is quicker than I expected.6. Haptic feedback is very refined. I used to turn it off on phones. On this one, it's on.The bad:1. The curved edges make it more slippery and the image on the edges reflect and appear distorted, any element there is hard to touch. Collects fingerprint marks easily. I dont find the missing notch makes any huge difference in my usage.2. There is no headphone socket on the phone, no USB-C headphone or adapter in the box3. The selfie camera is average, The rear triple camera setup isnt great as advertised. The main camera is good but gives inconsistent results.The Ugly1. Handling the phone because of it's weight, size and top heaviness, slipperiness.2. Battery life is a shame for a 4000mAh. Bringing down refresh rate and screen resolution made it a bit better, but it's still a one day phone at best.3. Wide angle lens is low on detail, not too wide yet creates distortion4. Not VFM at this price. Its should have been 6-8k cheaper for that.My impression is, this is a phone that only huge screen lovers should go for. The rest should wait for OP7, check if its battery life isnt as bad as this, and go for 8/256 version, still saving 11k over oneplus 7 pro. Else wait for s10/s10+ discount sale. I regret I didnt wait for S10 to be discounted.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Bang for the buck, superb design, top quality speaker, fantastic camera, just one drawback no 3.5mm headphone jack, but expect that  FANTASTIC DEAL\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  With standard use the phone simply died within a month form purchase. Something that you don't expect with a 52k flagship. I have logged a ticket with support and only the resolution they provide may help change the rating..\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  though the phone is heavily loaded but there are certain things which it lacks and is required by most of the common users. having a high camera setup the phone still gives you an ok image which when compared to other flag ships is way less quality wise. i felt for such high end phones 4000mah battery is less, though 7 pro gives you decent 1 and half day back up on normal usage but same back gets reduced to a day or less on extensive usage. last but the most important is the head phone jack,  i was expecting one plus would provide c to 3mm jack connector like they did in case of one plus 6 and 6t. strange thing is they don't have enough inventory of the same.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The phone is a beast. I switched for iPhone to one plus. Not sure if you'll find a phone this fast and smooth. The 90hz is a treat to scroll through, you will feel the difference after using this phone and then switching to a different phone with a basic 60hz. The experience is just wonderful. The fingerprint even though is fast it's not necessarily consistent you'll sometimes need to keep trying to unlock the phone and the camera is decent at most, does the job most of the time. Video watching experience is absolutely wonderful, great battery life, you can expect a whole day even with considerable usage. Absolutely worth the money\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I got a faulty product delivered and it was promptly repalced by the service center, good people at Chennai (Masood) and Bangalore (Anirudh) Service Centre.

       " \"\\n\\n  First of all, Let's talk about Negative FirstI should say that Oneplus Copied the Design from Samsung and This truly looks like S9 or something like that, its edge Display is the worst implementation, Overall Designiis good, but coming to Screen its really annoying why Oneplus opted for this. Who want a curved display..? If some one wants they will buy a Samsung.2. Weight if the product, it's really heavy this is also may be because if copying from Samsung.3. Warp Charger, it's to make us fools, really, when Charging Oneplus 6T and 7Pro, we surely notice that warp charger is another normal oneplus charger as both charges at same speed, what's the use of warp Circuit..? Still the speed is decent enough but not satisfactory for its name.4. Popup Camera, Of course Design wise it is an asset, but if Safety of Camera Considered then Popup camera takes out the points. If course they shown some circus tricks by weighing some stone to it, but they never shown how many times the motor can handle up and down of it..? If you use face unlock, that little thing pops up minimum 50 times a day and in long run.. Can it withstand..?Here Punch Hole Display is true Winner.Now coming to positives.1. Excellent Display, if we eliminate that edge Display fi a while and feel the 90hz Fluid AMOLED Display, then we really feel the smoothness of it, just like butter, and the Delivery of saturation, whites everything is natural and with vivid option it looks astonishing.2. Both Front and Rear Cameas work like pro, front camera gives pics with over Sharpness may be issue with resolution, but after processing they are good. Coming to Rear Camera, wide angle lens are not Doing its job perfectly, may be software issue, but still Potrait or normal works great, Quality is too good.3. In screen Fingerprint works really great, fast and no need to search for sensor.4. Battery Life, With Heavy Usage, 8hrs, with Moderate Usage,16hrs, with Normal Usage, 20+ hours and I got more than 48 hours of life with Light Usage. Battery backup is Decent when we combine all the draining factors like 6.6 inch Display, In Screen Finger Print, Quad HD Display, 90hz Refresh Rate and all.5. NO need to say about Performance, 855 processor says it all.Overall, It's a beast with some Drawbacks and I personally feel Oneplus crossed its limits by pushing its flagship killer mark to Flagship Competitor, Oneplus itself bought its destruction, sooner or later its greediness to takeover the market makes it vulnerable and make it extinct, I think this is my Last Oneplus Device as surely they will go beyond 60k from next mobile.They say some Quality Comes with a price to pay..My question is why can't this be applied to Samsung and Apple when Oneplus introduced Oneplus One..?Am writing This review after using the mobile for 4 days.Thank you.\\n\\n\",\n",

What more do you need?My shout-out to the Oneplus team that is working non-stop on improving the user experience. In less than 2 month, I have received 4 updates that resolved a few initial bugs only cos they are listening to us and working on the feedback.Own one to see how they keep customers at the top of their priority list.\\n\\n\",\n",

Minimally intrusive, maximally productive. The touches are thoughtful and subtle. One plus adheres to the Android design philosophy and adds functionality that one needs. No unnecessary bloat from functionality that I would use an app for. The migrate app is awesome. The features one feels are the ones that Android would absorb in the future. Similar to what Motorola promised before Lenovo started killing it off.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been a big fan of One plus phones as I have been using it for past many years but this new purchase has been quite shocking. On receiving the box we have the same excitement but this time the phone would not get 'on' and show a set up software problem as seen in the screen shot uploaded. This is really frustrating that a phone of this cost will even fail to start , what to say of other features. It seems that the quality of these phones have taken a serious beating. I have requested for replacement. The company must look into such problems as they are very irritating and will dent their image severely.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I have some minor issue with this phone. Firstly the screen guard. The phone is 45K+ but the inbuilt screen guard was as cheap as hell plastic guard. Got so many scratches after 2-3 days of minimum usage to the point where it doesn't feels like it was bought a week ago. Don't bother selling a phone worth 45K and no proper screen guard.Secondly, the touch doesn't reponds sometimes. I have to close the apps and then it starts working again and it's really frustrating.Thirdly, the Bluetooth stops working sometimes too when you want to share some files.Fourthly, the camera. It's not as good as I expected it to be. 48MP but the quality is not there. Shouldn't the pictures be more defined and detailed.\\n\\n\",\n",

Easy to use the alert slider.While setting up the phone with data transfer from old phone felt the temperature was high even though there is liquid cooling system. But then it's only one time process and never felt the heat later.It's very huge and heavy. After using this phone and when used my old OnePlus 5T I could feel how thick and heavy this phone is compared to 5T which is so slim. I think OnePlus has to reduce the weight of the phone and also reduce the size to 5.5 inches fire another category of users.\\n\\n\",\n",

The system performs quite well and attention to small details make it feel nice. The OS as such doesn't have any new feature since android, i think is reaching its limit. So the performance tuning is wat is concentrated on and that has been adequately. Only major drawback i feel is in the department of the camera as it is not upto the mark. Initially at first glance it looks all nice and good, but the minute you start to zoom into it then it looks worthless. I wonder how DxO Mark rated it at 111??\\n\\n\",\n",

The touch and screen display cteates a lot of problem. On day two of using this phone, the screen suddenly turnee black. I was unable to unclock the phone or see any screen. All i could see was the clock display. And then the finger print sensors were displayed. I could not restart the phone as well for a long time.

Good work Oneplus.From two days of experience (will edit comment if anything new comes up):Pros:Everything in the news hold true -1. Good looking large screen - fun to use a truly full screen phone.2. Overall build of the phone is great - thought it would be too heavy (200gm) to use but it is not so.3. Battery does hold up for up to 1.5 days on a single charge (I'm a moderate user)4. Camera is decent. I currently switch between GCam and Default camera apps depending on what I'm shooting. Better to have both installed and available for your use.Cons:Again, the news holds true.1. Ghost touches: The issues reported on ghost touches does occur. But this happens only occasionally, does not bother you much.2: Weak speaker - when set to Max phone volume, it's feels less pleasant to hear. Must ensure that it is not set at full volume.3. Phone hangs/stutters when re-used after a long break. Not sure if this is android's fault or oneplus'Current verdict: This is one of the best phones out there, pricey but effective.

       " '\\n\\n  It\\'s not the \"flagship killer\" OnePlus would like it to be, but each iteration gets a little closer. It remains to be seen if subsequent models will become serious competition while remaining at the same price point.As an avid fan of mobile photo/video, this phone is usable but still not quite where I would expect it to be at this price point.All in all, it\\'s an okay phone for the money, but if you\\'re concerned about having quality computational photography, noise-free/artifact-free video, etc, you\\'re better off going with the Pixel 4 (even my pixel 2 XL takes higher quality photo/video with far lower noise and artifacting) or spending a little more for the Galaxy.If having high quality photo or video doesn\\'t rank as high on your list of needs then you will very likely really enjoy this phone and for the price I would definitely recommend it.If high quality photo/video is high on your list of needs, I recommend taking a pass on this phone; It\\'s definitely not for the photo/video enthusiast.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  The phone is just wonderful! Although the phone was released almost exactly a year ago, it shows no sign of slowing down. The screen is just wonderful, and at its current price point, it's a bargain. Flagship quality for half the price. It misses out on very few features (like wireless charging, but I wouldn't really have used it with Warp Charge, so no complaints from me here) and the camera isn't the best (much better from when it was initially released, the camera captures everything quite naturally, if you give it good lighting though. Low light photography isn't great (especially compared to the iPhone 11 Pro, although that costs over twice what this one costs.) The screen is absolutely mesmerizing! Gets quite bright, but not the brightest. Not overally saturated, color reproduction is quite accurate. In-display fingerprint scanner is as fast as any normal fingerprint scanner, which is great news. OxygenOS is clean and beautiful. An awesome wrapper over android. No bloatware (except a couple of Oneplus Apps which come pre-installed, which are usually deletable). Overall, the best value for money right now (and for the near future as well). Do buy this over the Oneplus 7t or the 8!Enough said about the phone, the delivery process was quite disappointing. Amazon delivery agents don't know how to handle the exchange process. They have no idea how to navigate through the process specified, and wasted almost half an hour of my time, just to give me my phone. I've faced a similar issue with another phone I got delivered recently, and the experience this time around was even worse. Hope they change it soon.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Two of the reasons for buying OnePlus 7 Pro were battery life and space. Although Notes app is not pretty much impressive, I need this app to store my ideas and write-ups (I am into professional writing). Moreover, the phone offers 256GB space at a lower cost than any iPhone would provide. For the same storage space in any Apple device, I would have to spend more than 55K. OR I had to choose an older iPhone, which I never wanted to do. So OnePlus 7 Pro was my choice. I can store my data (documents, photos, and videos). Fingerprint, sometimes, needs two-three taps and sometimes, I have to use passcode to unlock the device. But this is OK as long as it is not a daily trouble. If you are into writing or any other creative field, wherein you have to store some data, go for it. And yes, the strong battery. Even if I use mobile data, the battery lasts pretty long...and with its warp charger, it charges quickly. Like the double-tap to wake screen feature...\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Over all it is a good phone. Upgrading from oneplus 3t to oneplus 7 Pro. Battery life is the best thing which I felt in this mobile. But there are a few problems with this phone which I encountered in nearly one month of usage.1) Fingerprint scanner not working sometimes :  I do not know whether it is happening to others as well, but when I try to unlock the phone, sometimes the fingerprint scanner is disabled and I have to use the pattern to unlock the screen. It happened a lot in this first one month of the usage.2) Camera is over beautifying the  pics taken. Most of the times when you click a photo, you looks over beautified than the actual person. The depth of the photo is getting compromised in this way. slightly dark colored people like me will get a shook  when you see the first photo of yourself. :D.  Also pics taken from the ultra wide lens are distorted when you zoom a little bit.\\n\\n',\n",

On top of this i spent about 1,500 for the screen protection which keeps it safe from the damage.

My views :Pros :- Display quality is amazing & enjoying it- Speed is extremely good- Camera is very good- Some of the features are good in this modelCons :- Battery life is not good. Need lot's of improvements in battery optimization- In adaptive brightness the screen brightness doesn't change automatically (even if you set it) many a time. You have to manually switch the adaptive brightness off & then on, then the screen will change the brightness. This might be a bug, which OnePlus needs to resolve- In the new pc received I found bubbles on screen guard provided- Weight of the product is highUsing it for more than 15 days now & I am loving it inspite of few negative points, being a OnePlus lover. But the company has to improve the product in many ways & we expect the updated in the near future.\\n\\n\",\n",

With full battery it works for more than a day with moderate use of phone with gaming & watching videos- Camera quality is not up to a mark compared to other flagship phones but better than its previous version 6TCons :- No 3.5 mm headphone jack- No IP rating for water resistance- Slightly bigger in size- Slightly heavy in weight- Ghost touch on cornors.

       " \"\\n\\n  Awesome and excellent phone....Delivery is quick in 2 days..The only con is it is a bit heavy.. But the fantastic screen makes u forget about that...And u need to use a case. As it is heavy if it falls accidentally there are more chances of getting damaged..Regarding charging 30w charger is superb..Battery draining is not so fast.. An average user can get a ful day charge easily...I don't use camera much... I used Asus zenfone 5z and LG v30 plus previously both are flagship phones at that time. But the camera quality is very nice here compared to both of them..Fingerprint reader is also fast and smooth.. I don't use face unlock bcoz it takes a little time and need to swipe to get the pop up camera open..Got a transparent case in the box.. It is of good quality but it doesn't give a good look to ur mobile. So better to buy a back cover online..Display is very smooth.. Watching movies and videos Is awesome... It's very bright and got no problems in watching under direct sunlight..Not too many customizations we can find here in oxygen os..Coming to stereo speakers, they are good and decent but not as loud as zenfone 5z..As there is no headphone jack I had ordered Bluetooth earphones.. They are on the way and had to use them to write review about sound quality..Played PUBG and other big games without any lag.. Runs very smooth.. As it is 12GB ram all the games and apps we use they Wil be in the ram without getting closed..The phone may gets heated up definitely if we use camera for more time or play non stop games.. That Wil be very common with any mobile..You need to be very careful as it is very heavy it is slippery too.. So u need to definitely use a case for that..My final verdict is if you don't have problem with it's weight then it is the best flagship phone right now in the market at this price.. Lack of wireless charging and headphone jack is not a problem to me.. It has the best screen till now..Am writing now after 20 days of use now.. I observed it's hanging sometimes when playing some small games which I did not get any prblm with big games. I don't know why.. Despite of having 12gb ram why it's hanging.. I hope it Wil be resolved in future updates..And one more thing is proximity sensor is not working properly a lot of times during calls leading to accidental touches which is irritating.. Hope everything Wil be solved in future updates..Thank you...\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  \\xa0Please see the attached video. This was my first oneplus purchase. I purchased it on 20th Oct in sale and prepaid 42000. Got it on 24th and as you see it had faulty Android and hanging issue. I was unable to do even initial setup. NOW AMAZON REMOVED THEIR RETURN POLICY. so you can not directly return it, one TAPORI technician will come and he will check whether mobile is really having any issue or not. Trust me he was one of the most unprofessional person I met in my life. But some how he understood my problem and forwarded the issue to Amazon team. So now my replacement will come in next week.CONCLUSION: I paid 42000 on 20th Oct and I got working mobile on 4th of Nov. This is worst service by Amazon and worst product of Oneplus. Never gone buy any oneplus product again.\\n\\n',\n",

Infact i have replaced my previous one plus seven pro and the one which i got and using now has the same problem of heating. You can't use it continuously as it gets heated so much. Charging is fast.

So no comments on that.With 30W Warp Charge, the 4000mAh battery can be recharged pretty fast as well (as per the company's claim and its working excellent so far).Camera is working as expected and also tried few nightmode shots and it is also satisfying.No troublesome heating issues found so far.There is no headphone jack, but i don't have any problem with that as I am using OnePlus Bullet Wireless 2 (Excellent choice for OnePlus7Pro).Ps:- This is my first OnePlus company's product and I simply loved everything about it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using 8GB variant for 3 months.Before this one  , i had OP 5t. 5t never had heating issues whereas this phone gets heated with continuous use.The only pros of upgrading to 7pro from 5t is quality of display , bezel less display , screen size. But 7 pro is not up to the mark in terms of camera performance. Below average camera. It sometimes clicks good picture under good light conditionsMost of the times i use FHD+ display to save battery and i hardly switch to QHD+ which doesn't really make much difference.Finger print reader is fine. Not as fast as 5t that may be because of in display finger print reader.Overall this mobile is okay if you are not a camera enthusiastic.But personally i don't find it to be a worthy upgrade from op5t.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Interested in returning and getting a refundA lot of issues with One plus 7 Pro...1) Ghost touches- the touch screen acts wierd sometimes and apps open up and closes automatically.2) Delayed Response- while making calls, there is quite a long delay one I click call option. Sometime feels like the touch is not working and suddenly after 10-15 sec or more, the phone goes into calling mode.3) Voice disturbances-many instances, when the call is made, voice is not transmitted.4) CAMERA- even after the update the back camera is still blurred. Indoors it take decent photography but not up to the mark of a flagship killer (as these are called). The focus is bad. In potrait (depth) mode background is not blurred.I have been following OnePlus community forums and these problems are common all across. Also different people are getting different issues.Would really like to get money back. But the option for refund or replacement wasn't available initially and now it shows refund period closed on 30th may. Looks like a cheap stunt to force the products on the consumers.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I've had this phone for 4 months now. I'll just get down to what I feel about it so far.Personally, this phone was way out of my budget, so I used the HDFC debit card (zero payment) EMI. I still have 2 months left on it, but I don't regret this decision one bit.The phone is built really well and the pop-up camera has an incredible 'reflexes'. Meaning if you accidentally drop your phone while the pop cup camera is open, the phone detects this and immediately shuts it before the phone drops to the ground.The camera is superb- both video and still. The landscape wide-angle lens is almost at par with the iPhone 11 (I did a comparison with my friend's). The slo-mo video camera is pretty good too. The phone also has an inbuilt video stabilizer. The quality of the video deteriorates in this mode, but in a well-lit environment it's still great!The phone charges really quickly, from nothing to full in about 2 hours.Two downsides to this phone are that the finger print recognition can be a little annoying. It doesn't always recognise the fingerprint instantly. And the other is the mic for capturing audio. I'm a musician and sound designer and I thought that this phone would give me almost iPhone like audio recording, but it's way off. It's a long time before this phone can reach to where the iPhone is in terms of audio recording.All in all, a great phone. Super fast, can play any game, run any app and stream any video smoothly.\\n\\n\",\n",

Even than lots of reviewer have tested in water so did I & product seems to work fine without any issues .Despite of having such a beautiful display & 90hrz power pack performance there isn't any tempered glass for same which I can protect it with .Upgrades & updates have been consistently improving without any delay or lags.Pop up camera seems to work perfectly great knowing the fact about limited numbers of move ,insipite of same there have been lot of safety measures for force movement incase occured at time in pocket . I wouldn't suggest to use face unlock more often as the under display scanner is the best in it's class & most freakingly smooth.Glass back is litle bit scary at times as now we have to protect the front as well back of the phone ,for which I use the default case provided by OnePlus themself .Shipping this phone has been a night Mayer for me as amazon weren't efficient enough to deliver the product to me on time ,as sum issue with there shipper & loss of good .which was a surprise to go through .Overall it's a good experience on the handset side ,since there's nothing better than having a 90hz refresh rate & such a powerful performance.\\n\\n\",\n",

The audio isn't as much loud like S9+ but it's fine.  OnePlus has to work on image quality, probably thru software update.

I don't play games at all so gamer u have no idea wabiut would you look in a phone. Battery backup is awesome. Just one concern, OnePlus needs to push security updates on time.

I had to literally Google to check if there are other folks facing the similar issues and to my surprise there were plenty. I have used 5T and 6T both and I never faced this issue but it's completely annoying and disappointing that a phone would die like this on just the second day. Additionally I didn't quite like the battery life, even when I am not using it, the phone seems to be losing a lot of charge. The other issue I faced was I tried the smart Lock feature and used my finger print lock and also the pattern lock. The fone would automatically lock itself even when I am watching you tube or using the fone. This was like annoying to the heights. I had selected the screen time for 5 mints but still the fone would auto lock within seconds. I was so annoyed so I removed all the lock system off\\n\\n\",\n",

My only complain is the camera. In this price of phone you expect really good camera. Unfortunately that's not the case. Camera is just average.

       " \"\\n\\n  I ordered as soon as was available. The phone looks beautiful, feels premium. The letdown begins when u start using it for a while. The fingerprint reader was easy enough to setup. But upon usage had issues. it didn't work all the time. Lots of time the phone would just keep saying too many attempts & keep asking for pin. The pop up camera started having weird rubbing noise Everytime it was used.the phone calls had weird static distortion in them while they were quite clear on my iphone. I think they will release an update to fix it. The edges of the screen with the curve e resistance to touch and since the corners of the screen r more rounded than others, lots of time functionality was cut off. Like the voice message button in WhatsApp. The screen looked great with the 90hz display but unresponsiveness killed all the fun. It dosent matter if the screen is good . It might have a higher refresh rate but will still feel slow if the responsiveness is low. The camera quality was the most dissapointing aspect. Coming from iPhone the difference was quite apparent. The images seemed more granier and more saturated. The 3x zoom is underwhelming. Will probably install the pixel camera software as the stock software just dosent match up. But then the pixel phones have the best camera processing in the smartphone world.The battery is fine not great, but that was to be expected with the quad hd 90hz display. Roughly lasts 8to 9 hrs on average usage for me. Warp charge is a boon.Overall the price increase for the pro version does not seem to be justified. Too many trade-off. The one plus 7 which is not getting as much attention is a much better phone and more value for money. The difference in value proposition seems negilible between the two.\\n\\n\",\n",

They are loud but not clear(Maybe it can be improved by changing the some setting or solve it in the next updates)My review : Overall i loved the phone..

Some user will change the display setting to 60Hz, but if you start using it on 90Hz then there no way you will go back to 60Hz..Pros : As per my usage..#1 - If you use it for 30 mins and then take some another phone, you will not like the other phone.. You will fall in love with the display and once you start using it daily, you will not touch any other phone..#2 - Phone has a 1440 x 3120 pixels resolution and huge screen size, so if you watch a lot of content on your phone, You will love it..#3 - Performance is really fast..#4 - Definitely whole day battery life.. (1.5 day for me)Cons : As per my usage..#1 - As the screen size is huge, it is very difficult to use the phone in one hand.. You cannot type while chatting with one hand..#2 - Finger print sensor - I keep my phone inside my bag while driving, the screen wakes up so many times.. Accidental screens wakes up a lot..(Hope they solve this issue in next updates)#3 - Sometimes some apps do crash.. (It may be the choice of app i may use)\\n\\n\",\n",

This phone justifies the price of 40K. It beats the Samsung and iPhone hands down in Display and aesthetics. Camera is tad bit inferior to Iphone Pro Max and Note 10 but the difference is marginal. Normal user will find it hard to notice the difference. Night Mode has been great with the latest software on.And yes, the User experience is better than Iphone. It took all these years for and Android phone to trump Apple in that regard. 90Hz refresh rate is not a gimmick, it makes every other mobile phone 'feel' slow.Battery life is great, lasts a full day with moderate to heavy usage , even with that 4k (90Hz)  screen on.

But still need to see how long that goes. maybe i will have to review again after 3-5 months of use on the battery part..As a brand i feel that Oneplus is too confident now that they have acquired a steady market now and they feel that now they can start cheating the customers.. For this hefty price - there is not even a headphone, the 6+T atleast came with a supporting cable for the Aux, 7+pro didnt even have that.. I still wonder whats the reason for this price tag..I Should have gone for the Iphone XR..This is my biggest mistake i have ever done in purchasing a phone over the years..  NOT WORT THE PRICETAG\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  The details of the design are absolutely amazing. Screen, camera and speed are key features of this phone. The speakers have a clean stereo sound. The transition between applications is very smooth. Overall a very good phone to have. One drawback, if you are looking for a handy set then you can opt out of purchasing this.\\n\\n',\n",

If you are typing in anything in a app. Suddenly the app closes automatically. Finger readers sometimes need 2 to 3 touches to work. Camera is excellent as expected. Much more was expected as this was a pro model. But every avarage performance. Fixes should be provided to overcome issues.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I cant tell you how amazing this phone is! I have been using this phone since one month.I would just say, go for this phone and you will never regret buying this!My mind was flipping between k20 pro and oneplus 7 pro, review in various websites says that both the phones are almost same in every aspect except the range,my sister bought k20 and i got a chance to test the camera on both the phones with my own naked eyes, and what i found is the quality of pictures on oneplus 7 pro is something i have never ever seen on any smartphone, not even iphones.Apart from the amazing camera, there are alot other features that i wished to be present in my phone. The gestures work perfectly, touch works as smooth as butter.No phone heating even while playing games in highest quality graphics. Yes, it heats little bit when you play and charge ur phone at the same time, but that is acceptable as it does not happen in every scenario and little bit is fine considering the processor.If you have proper knowledge of how to capture a photo by setting uo the focus and other stuffs, trust me you will end up taking a photo just like a dslr camera.Haptic feedback is another amazing feature on this phone, it really takes the gaming to another level, it vibrates when there is a beat/bass in the sound effect, wow so amazing man!Dolby speakers is another legendary feature that will blow your mind! Two speakers are always better than one!The flexibility to change the screen resolution just like in pcs is another feature. If you are worried that 90hz refresh rate would consume more battery, oneplus proved it wrong! I have not noticed any unnecessary battery consumption by the screen! The android version 10 has given this phone amazing utilization of resources, intellegent analysis by android tells me if any website or app is consuming battery higher than expected, this is a much needed feature on a smartphone with tons of apps loaded in it just like mine.To be really very frank, i have used this phone vigorously since i bought it just to check the benchmark of this phone and has not yet disappointed me. The only cool stuff from oneplus i miss on this phone is the notification led, coz there is no hardware support for it, although oneplus has tried to use the screen as the notification led, but it needs improvement and development and i am expecting oneplus team to arrange something cooler for the led.I am fully satisfied with this phone and i am hoping oneplus would not discontinue this product or pushing the android upgrades else it would be a huge disappointment.Great job Oneplus team!\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  This is hands down the fastest phone out right now and will be for the rest of 2019 and 2020 until Oneplus 8 comes out. Oneplus tinkers with Android OS to prioritise on speed. This phone would easily last someone 3+ years. The screen is absolutely stunning and the 90hz motion on the screen makes it one of the best screens out. Camera is also brilliant and takes amazing pictures. It's got wide angle lens which I absolutely love. Similar to go pro. It's also got standard lens which takes great photos on day and at night too. And a zoom lens. Battery life is also very good and would easily last a day. I never have to worry about storage since it has enough to store for over 2 years for me. Google photos backs up unlimited photos and videos for free so I don't have to always keep photos in my device. So 256gb storage is an overkill and I love it. The price of this phone is a few hundred pound cheaper than others and is better to me! You would absolutely love the warp charger. It will charge your phone to around 50% in 20 minutes. It is a lot faster than Samsungs fast charge. The best part is that it will still charge fast even if you're using the phone where as other chargers will slow it down a lot. I have zero regrets from getting this phone! Thank you Oneplus for making an amazing phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

I have spent 58k for this phone and now I feels like I have paid for wrong device.I advice all to go for Samsung or Apple iPhones because they are maintaining value of their flagships for at least a year.Camera: It will miss some frames when recording in slow motion. Also there are many flaws in camera system which may be resolved with software updates.At last I will say that Amazon service was very poor. When I ordered this phone from Amazon, It was reached at Amazon's local facility whithin two days. But As I am a non prime member, they took 2 more days for delivery.

Infact, my previous phone Redmi Note5 Pro used to click better selfies. Battery drains quickly if you use 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. Luckily, it has a warp charging adapter with it. Although, the phones gives you premium feel at a premium price but One Plus should look into the Camera Software updates.

       " '\\n\\n  Review after eight days of heavy use:Blazing fast.Fabulous screen.No heating.Transfer 25 GB of data from leptop in just 15 minutes .ConsBit heavy and uncomfortable for one hand use.Except it definitely buy it\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The performance of this phone is simply phenomenal. I opted for the 256 GB + 8 GB RAM option. With an uncommon screen refresh rate of 90 Hz ,scrolling through applications and switching between them is fast and buttery smooth. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is very fast and rarely misses on the first try. The edge to edge screen is huge and very emersive; being a class leading Samsung AMOLED screen colors are rich and vibrant. Using the pop-up selfie camera is both clever and fast. The camera quickly emerges from it's cubby hole and quickly returns. The phone can instantly detect when it's in free fall and will quickly and automatically retract the camera to avoid damage. A lot of reviewers lamented this phone's lack of official water resistance rating. The phone is definitely water proof. I have had it exposed to pouring rain and placed it on wet surfaces without any issues.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Writing this review after 1.5 monthSo guys the 90hz screen the best part you will definitely call in love with it from the day one it's buttery smooth with sd 855 man it's a beast playing HD games feels great on this phone.Charging is also fast ever morning I plug my device and I get my device all juiced up before leaving office in about an hour.Although it has no 3.5 mm headphone jack but you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy the c type bullets available at OnePlus website (they are awesome) or but the connector available at OnePlus website, so stop making a fuss about 3.5 mm jack (u are spending around 50k here, go buy a decent headphone too).Camera after the updates improved a lot and now pictures are quite good, still there are some issues with lowlight photos but in proper light the photos are good. Front camera selfie is also good no issues with that.Overall a nice phone, a bit overpriced (after looking at the price of k20 pro üòõ) but yes it's still the flagship killer and way better than many of it's competitors.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I am using this device for around a week. These are the things I came across:1.) Display is very big. It is okay for me but single hand operation will be difficult if you havent got big enough hands.2.) This device is heavy. Again for me the weight was okay but it might not be for u.3.) Low light camera performance not amazing.4.) Otherwise camera performance is very good.5.) RAM management is excellent .. didnt come across any lag issues or frame drops while playing.6.) Charges really fact and have a good enough screen on time(for me).There are minor issues which i believe they will fix with upcoming updates and YES they either should have provided a headphone jack or some connector for my wired headphones. This is expected as u are pricing something around 50k and also not proving wireless charging and waterproof certifications......this is kinda upsetting.But yes it is a good device. It will give you the best performance and yea looks amazing. Except that jack issue I dont have any other complains.\\n\\n',\n",

All things look much beautiful in one plus 7 Pro becz of such good display.I think one plus should have provided headphone jack connectors, as there is slot for it and we are able to use one plus 6t's connector, so there's no use of not providing the connector, or else they should provide free Bluetooth earphones.\\n\\n\",\n",

While takin wide angle pics of a building and scenery is just great.. the wide angle picture of a person withe the scene in background is just pathetic...there are distortions like the limbs of the person become longer (yes you read that right) the skin tone is straight up washed out...

So any where you are get it charged within 20min and more than 80% of your battery gets ready, for safety purpose get yourself screen protector for the phone first, since the display is one which gets affected in case of any physical damage.

       " '\\n\\n  Camera quality is very poor. Being a premium phone, the One Plus brand did not pay much attention on primary camera. The primary camera comes with 16MP, but the resolution is not as expected. The selfies taken by MI is far better then the one captured by this phone. The One Plus brand should take this feedback very seriously and try to fix it up by providing some updated camera software updates.Very much disappointed as far as camera is concerned.The package lacks the Type C USB to audio jack converter. The One Plus should take up this feedback and include the one in the pack.As far as battery back up is concerned, it is very good. Luckily I did not get carried away by other reviews on Amazon :).\\n\\n',\n",

The portrait mode could also be a bit improved.The battery is not terrible, but should carry around the charger if travelling for a day.The phone is pretty huge and heavy, but don't know if that's much of a big deal.Overall a futuristic smartphone with pretty descent value for money. I definitely bought this device over the regular one plus 7 for the screen and it's obviously worth it. Add a warp charge that can give a full charge in about an hour, a very satisfying haptic feedback, a definite head turner popup cam, triple cam setup and it's very much a value for money flagship !!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I have got 2 OnePlus 7 Pro in my family right now.One in Mirror Black and another in Nebula Blue (Both are 8gb/256gb models). As far as looks are concerned, both the colors look fabulous. Nebula Blue looks strikingly beautiful.Specs sheet can be obtained from the description box, so I ain't gonna discuss about it. Review will be purely based on the user experience.Things I like:1) Looks- I'm gonna say it again and again, this phone looks stunning. As soon as you take this phone in your hand, you will feel that you didn't dump your money in garbage. This sure looks and feels premium.2) Software- Oxygen OS works like a charm on this phone. No lags, nothing. It's super clean and useful and highly customisable. You'll get regular updates (august security patch was delivered to this phone even before pixel phones which is mind blowing) with a promise of 3 years of future updates.3) Camera- I'm currently on the Oxygen OS version 9.5.11 and believe me when I say, the camera is not a regular Joe. It performs well in all lighting conditions. All the three lenses are very useful in taking different kind of shots. Nightscape is fantastic. The camera app has been given several tweaks with regular OTA updates and it's always getting better.4) Hardware and build quality- Phone has excellent hardware. Throw any app/games on it and it will run as smooth as butter. RAM management is also very good. Battery runs through an entire day and I have noticed some improvement in battery life after the last update. On an average, I'm getting around 5.5-6.5 hrs of screen on time, which is decent. The phone surface is quite slippery, I was keeping it without back cover, but the sixth drop made me realise that I should put the cover back on. The phone is still not damaged but there are some minor scratches around the corners.Overall- Build quality is superb.I would highly recommend this phone to someone who wants a high performance phone with quality hardware.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Though I liked the phone very much, I was shocked to note that there was no User Manual. I checked online too but not available online too. When I contacted Oneplus for the same, I was informed that manual must be inside the box or I should contact Amazon from where I bought the phone. Unfortunately I can not find a way to contact Amazon and as a result, I am not in a position to use my Phone fully.\\n\\n',\n",

Blazing fast...Never hangs or freezes...5. Camera hardware is top notch!6.

The battery is pretty good, fingerprint sensor works most of the time, vibration motor is amazing, 90 hz is the Trump card. Everything about this phone is spectacular except:The fact that OnePlus have decided to skip the headphone adapter in the box. I covered myself in this regard by buying it before the phone itself but it has been out of stock ever since. There is no reason to omit it from the box.OnePlus has said that it is splash proof, but an official IP rating would have been nice.I don't use wireless charging but for a phone that costs 50k, it should have been there.

I wouldn't say it's big, but rather it's immersive. And rhe refresh rate is just the icing on the cake.The battery life is also nice, much better than I thought as a day would be enough for a heavy user, and there's no need to worry as the Warp Charger is there to help you out.Now the main weakness on of this phone is the camera. Well it's not that bad but it's not what everyone would expect from a OnePlus device for the premium pricing, well it's kind of descent, much more similar to the previous generations, just the wide angle lens is the main centre of attraction.And at last the built quality and performance, hands down, unbeatable!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Let's get the cons out of the way. I noticed mainly 3 things that may concern buyers.1. Form Factor- The size and weight of this phone is too big. Even if I have bigger hands.its impossible to use in one hand. You will get used to the weight but when u pick up other devices u will feel OnePlus 7 pro could have better weight balamce. It may pain a little if u are lying down and watching any video for a long time.2. Battery life - on paper 4000 mAh battery looks good.but it's battery back up is average. I am getting little more than  4 Hrs screen on time. U can increase the battery by turning off 90 hz . Buts what's the point of turning it off while 90 hz is the reason u r buying this phone.3. No always on display- Coming from Samsung phones I really miss the always on display features. Thought it has ambient display but u can never see notification unless u touch the phone. Don't know why OnePlus did not give this feature. At least give a option to turn it on or off.Now let's talk about advantages of this phone.1. Display- oh boy.u can enjoy this beauty of display all day long. Quad Hd 90 HZ amodled display is stunning. Once u use 90 hz other phones will feel slow and that includes iPhone too.yeah u heard that right.2. Sofwtwere experience- oxygen Os is so close to stock Android and in some cases it it better. Buttery smooth animation and super quick Android updates makes it one of the few devices having Android 10 at the time I am writing this review3. Sound Quality- This phone does have a decent dual stereo speaker which gets very loud. Audio quality is great also has Dolby Atmos support.4. Haptic feedback - I did not think earlier vibration  motors are to be considered as an advantages. But this phones vibration feedback is precise and strong. U will feel joy typing on this phone for sure.5. I was sceptical about this phones camera because many reviewers said camera is the weakest point of this phone. But I found the main 48 mp sensor as good as S10, iPhone 11 level. Though it's secondary cameras lacks behind those flagships.  U can tweak the photos little bit and will get excellent result. One plus nighscapeobe is brilliant. Better than Samsung's night mode.6. Performance - Snapdragon 855 and adreno 640 is more than capable of heavy tasks and gaming and this phone is no exception. Never faced any lag. That's it.Verdict- The pros overweights the cons by very long margin. If u can manage the weight or size this phone will bring a smile on your face. Thanks.\\n\\n\",\n",

The only complain is it's to heavy 4G only in Indian market, lake in wireless charging, can have a better battery capacity. Also kind of a need suit for PC for better connectivity. Overall a good phone in market at present. Feels premium to use especially for people upgrading from xiaomi MIUI to OnePlus.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Display is awesome. Buttery smooth touch. Samsung's display looks better cz of the color vividness and saturation. But this one is one of the best display. Processor? 855 sd no need to say more about it. Sound is supergood but still searching for earphones suitable with this device. Just disappointed with the camera. Wide angle is just useless as it has lower angle of view and when you zoom into clicked image its blurry. Same with normal pic. It looks good until you zoom. Pics clicked are not sharp they r soft and blurry. Even redmi phone 15k priced clicks sharper pics than this. 4k 60fps video is certainly something it saves this phone as clarity is really superb. Battery backup is below average for the price you are paying for this device but super fast charging makes up for it.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  \\xa0I don't think Amazon has sent me a original and brand new phone. The screen doesn't respond to touches most of the times and the fingerprint doesn't work already. I had the one plus 5t and didn't face any such issues but the customer care checks it for 5 seconds and says it's okay but it's really not working well. The fingerprint reader is slow.

Display so buttery smooth that I cant take my eyes off it.Fingerprint sensor is way too fast.Very happy with overall performance of the phone.Can be improved:Camera qualityBack case.

       " '\\n\\n  Disappointed with Amazon delivery as I had to wait 6 days for the delivery of the device after making payment in advance. The wait was worth it. The phone is bundled in a premium box with a letter from the founder and invitation to join the OnePlus forums. This was a nice touch.Retail box: Box contains the device, warp charger, documentation, SIM eject tool and a clear silicone phone sleeve. Headphones and/or USB type c to 3.5 mm jack is missing. 4/5Design: I ordered the nebula blue version of the phone. The front of the phone is all display with minimal bezels. The curved front gives a premium appearance to the device. The back of the device has a frosted blue glass finish. The back is resistant to fingerprints while the front is a fingerprint magnet. The phone has stereo speakers with the earpiece above the display functioning as one of the loudspeakers. The bottom firing speaker is present on the bottom bezel of the screen. The loudspeakers are loud and produce pleasant sound.Display: the QHD 90Hz HDR AMOLED display is a gorgeous work of art. The display is buttery smooth and the experience of interaction with the curved screen is a joy. The embedded in display fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurate.Camera: the front popup camera is a fixed focus unit. It produces bright images with adequate amount of details. The front camera is good for video calls. The back 48 MP camera is good in bright light conditions. Produces noisy images in low light conditions. Using GCAM or nightscape mode helps render usable night shots. The wide angle camera is a nice addition but the rendition and the amount of resolved detail are inadequate. The telephoto camera helps create 3x lossless zoom. The resolved details are usable for social media but not good for prints.Performance: the phone is blazing fast. The 8 GB RAM is more than adequate for day to day usage. The on board storage is blazing fast. The OxygenOS is a great implementation of android that is fast and has many usable additions to stock android.Battery life: The battery lasts 2 days with my daily usage involving 1 hour of web browsing, 1 hour of streaming videos and about 1 hour of phonecalls. The bundled fast charger is great. It charges the battery to 80% in 30 minutes.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I am writing this review after 9.5.10 update & after using it for more than 1 month.Pros:1.Display (though brightness could have been better) - My friends are just awestrucked by the quality of display OnePlus has put in. They say \"ufff!! Display ta dekh just, chokchok kor6e\" (Look at the display, it\\'s shining), \"Side theke dekh, sera, sera, kato daam re phone tar, amio kinbo\" (look at from the sides, awesome, awesome, how much does this phone cost,I will also buy it).2.Battery life - 1 day battery backup for heavy users. If used in dark mode and 30-40% brightness in auto switch & 90hz mode you may get upto 1.5 days battery life. But even if the battery get drained warp charge will charge it in an hour.3. Vibration - Best among most of the android phones out there but only bettered by iphone.4. Performance - Best performer till date. Oneplus\\'s software is the benchmark for the mobile industry. Take a bow oneplus.5. Sound Quality -  Loud & Crisp. Though a little more depth would have been appreciated.CONS1. Camera - Camera is a mixed bag. It takes inconsistent photos. But yesterday I received 9.5.10 update which corrected the over warm tone of the photos. People don\\'t look too pinkish & focusing is also improved. Wide angle lens can\\'t be used in videos as of now but oneplus is working on an update & will introduce this feature surely. Selfies are ok. In comparison to pixel & iphone & samsung\\'s flagship phones this camera may be inferior,but I have to say oneplus is able to improve the camera performance of this mobile through multiple updates. Now I am satisfied with the camera performance of this beast. Camera isn\\'t a deal breaker anymore.2. Lack of headphone jack - Even the type c to 3.5mm headphone is not included within the box & after 2 months of this phone\\'s launch oneplus is still not able to make it available to purchase from online or offline stores. Shame on you oneplus. You couldn\\'t give an adapter worth ‚Çπ390 (manufacturing cost is ‚Çπ40) in the box of a ‚Çπ50k rupees phone. This is my biggest gripe using this phone. But it\\'s a fault of OnePlus not the phone.Edit : Today I bought oneplus\\'s official audio adapter from their website for ‚Çπ439 (including shipping fee).3. No IP rating & wireless charging - though I don\\'t need them.4. Customer Support - No where near the quality of this phone. Few service centres are available. Most of the accessories are out of stock. I am very disappointed with the service of oneplus.5. Tempered glass - No official tempered glass launched by oneplus for op 7 pro whereas it\\'s available for the regular 7. I purchased an uv glue glass from a local shop worth ‚Çπ600 & the glues are spreading from the sides of the phone. Oneplus should have released their official tempered glass for their best phone.6. Price - I read from the internet that the manufacturing cost of this phone is ‚Çπ22k. But you are charging more than  double the manufacturing cost. This phone should have been priced at ‚Çπ40k,though it\\'s cheaper than samsung and apple\\'s flagships.ConclusionMost of the cons I mentioned are related to the support of oneplus not of this phone. Hence,I would suggest everyone who is looking to buy a real flagship, take this one & you won\\'t regret.Final rating9.5/10\\n\\n',\n",

I have done some nitpicking although after thorough use of the device for 4 days.1. Fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow sometimes. I have heard that it keeps on improving as days pass by. But it is annoying sometimes.2. SOT is somewhat between 5-6 hours with normal usage,  it would have been good to have around 4500mah battery capacity.3. Sensors does not work smoothly every time, auto brightness is aweful, fingerprint unlock misses one out of five times and pick up your phone to show has low response.4. Phone is heavy, would require time to get adjusted.5. Photo quality is great at daylights, but at night the corners get washed out a bit.6. Horizon light feature is just laughable, it happens only for a single time once a notification pops up and not at a certain interval.7. No 3.5mm headphone jack.None of the google, samsung, apple or huwaei provides latest flagship below 50k price range, so if you can live with the cons mentioned above, then happily buy this device.One more point, got the android 10 update on the same day I received the device from amazon.

When people say there's hardly any difference  between 60 Hz and 90 Hz it is not true.  I also went for 12 Gb option so this helps battery draining apps to run in the background.

       " '\\n\\n  Let me begin by saying that the display is just amazing. Everything is buttery smooth and fast. Coming to the fingerprint scanner it could be better because sometimes it takes time to read. Face id is fast, although i have nothing else to compare it with but still good. And camera to be honest is actually good and night mode is little bit sumdgy somtimes but still captures good night pictures. Video recording is the best i gotta say, it is very stable. The only problem i found about the video is the 4k 60 fps mode, the file size is so large it is actually impossible to record more than 10 mins which would probably take about 10gb of memory. The front camera is also pretty decent. Coming to the os its one of the best i have used and all the apps function very very smoothly. If you are planning to go for iphone in the same range i would recommend to go for oneplus 7 pro since its a much better buy.\\n\\n',\n",

Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  just bought oneplus 7 prowas exploring itsaved both of my thumbs as fingerprint but the phone opened with my right index fingerprintwhat the hell is this\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I am giving 1 star for poor camera quality .The camera is bad than my oneplus 3.Its not able to focus correctly and the final image is blurry.I discovered the issue when clicking a pic of a document.The text was not sharp and all and after doing some more testing with 3rd party apps , and going thru Oneplus Forum, found that many people are facing this same issue.Oneplus should fix this issue, else this would be like OP 2\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is a beast of a phone. Fastest processor amongst Android phones. Full screen AMOLED display takes the viewing experience to another level. Stereo speakers quality is too good. Can't ask for a better phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I got the Phone Yesterday. And from my 1 Day experience I'm giving you short review.. I won't go for the things It doesn't have.. I'll tell, how it works with the Things it have..1. Oh Boy, the Display, It's Smooth as Butter.. I think it's the best thing of this Phone.. You can use it all day and It's really really Awesome. No Display and I say No Display is Smooth and Vivid as This One...2. Speed! 90Hz Display and SD 855 show it's Muscle here.. From app opening to Gaming, it does everything smoothly!3. Build Quality is Great. It feels Solid. No way it's A One Handed Device. Slightly Heavier Side.4. Warp Charge!! Yesterday at Night 11.30 pm I started Charging with 11% Battery. Within 12.35 am it's 100%. It's Blazing Fast.Now Let's Talk about some Mediocre Stuff-4. Camera! It's Ok I'd say.. Colour is slightly shifted.. I don't know Why but My Poco is Capturing Better image than this in Automatic Mode.. It's Good and like traditional One Plus Camera.. The Only Weakness!! Front Camera is good but nothing Mind-blowing Crazy..  It tends to Crop too much in Front Camera Portrait Shots.I hope One Plus implement Wide Angle Video Recording..All I can say, It's Good Phone for 52K.. Value for Money.. But Market will be Competitive in May with Asus and Redmi New Launch. So if you can, Wait for 1 Month and Compare with Other Things.But If for Display, I will Choose this Phone Anyday over Upcoming Ones.. It's Best.... I think till Samsung Note 10, the One Plus Display will be Champion in Market.I didn't talk about 3.0 UFS storage cause everyday usage you won't see much difference.And Sorry for my Poor English!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Camera quality is almost same as 6T, which is worst, utterly flopped popup cameraDisplay of dark cell is very bad, M30 is much better than thisI don't know about this ram, without optimizing software, more power consumption which leads battery drains fast over multi tasking and produces heat.Finally oneplus is no more for mid range premium customers. 10k higher\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Camera quality is not up to mark as per price range.

Performance is top notch till date & now same device getting sold at 10k discount, so it\\'s good buy.----------------------------Planning to buy OnePlus 7 Pro? Here\\'s all in one review:Bought OnePlus 7 Pro in first sale, now using it from few days.Yeah! OnePlus 7 Pro priced little high.PRO\\'S:- OnePlus 7 Pro\\'s DISPLAY looks damn beautiful üòç with 6.67 inch OLED fluid Amoled 1440p display which has 90 Hz refresh rate.- It comes with pre-applied screen protector.- In display fingerprint sensor is faster than OnePlus 6T.- Warp charger charges very fast, from 0-50 in just 20 minutes.- In Fanatic mode, games can be played butter smooth.- Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.- Cam2api enabled.- Snapdragon 855 gives best performance.- Oxygen OS is BEAST, smooth, bloatware & ad-free, lag free.- UFS 3.0 helps to improve performance.CON\\'S:- Though, display looks beautiful with 90 Hz refresh rate, but because of that battery drains much faster, as result give Screen on time 4-5 hours. You can change it to 60 Hz to save battery.- Overpriced.- Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can\\'t even focus on near objects.- Device is heavy.- No IP rating, but according to few, it survives in water as well, but not tested personally üòõ.- No wireless charging.- No headphone.FINAL VERDICT:- If OnePlus 7 Pro satisfies your requirement, buy it though it\\'s little bit overpriced but still worth it.- If not 7 Pro, Samsung S10+ is also great choice.- Otherwise, if looking for low price phone, Flagship Killer 2.0 coming soon üòúNote: I\\'ll update review, after using for few days.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  \\xa0On the first day I am facing issue in setting and it's not opening having issue in WiFi connectivity...any more issue...\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Good phone. But after paying 52k we expect least a headphones. Ggwp OnePlus. On YouTube while unboxing. They get Bluetooth headphones, car charger, 3 different covers. Really disappointed when I found no headphone in 7pro 8gb RAM 256gb ROM\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  First of all i am a die hard fan of one plus.I have one plus 5t one plus 6t and now a one plus 7 pro.Seriously very disappointed with the camera.Before one plus i was a mi fan.I have redmi note 3 and note 7.Selfie camera comparison of op 7 n redmi note 7.Redmi note 7 selfie camera is for better than op 7 pro.Op7 pro selfie camera shows ur face like a skin disease patient.Where as op5t and op6t had no issues like this.For this price range op should have included wireless charging.Waiting for a better camera update.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  What a gem of a smart device! Absolutely incredible.Bit heavy, and SD 855 keeps rolling as it reduces battery drainage unbelievably, i didn't expect that.And look at the price, Oh ho man...! it helps us saving atleast 20k, you know what i mean...üòâ\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I generally use Apple iphone but this time I tried something different. I completely disappointed by using Oneplus 7 pro camera .iPhone 6 camera is more better than this. OIS and EIS is not working properly. There are so many UI issues as well in Oxygen OS.Phone is quite Bulky and not able to handle by using single hand. I wasted 53k to buy this phone. I never buy any product of OnePlus in future.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Heating as hell, poor battery backup. Camera is not good. And it's heavy. Don't feel effect of Dolby Atmos.Pro- just it's screen.I will update after further usage.Update after 1 week, heating issue gone. Facing WhatsApp and YouTube application's frequent crash. Camera quality is still an issue, it's good but not up to the mark of flagship.Update- pro-1. fingerprint sensor + face unlock is fast.2. night camera is really good3. video recording is stable.con-1.

Little bit thicker & hefty: 206gramsüèãÔ∏è compared to OnePlus7 weighing about 182grams.Will update my detailed review on OnePlus 7pro after One Month of usage.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I completely Loved the display quality , sound quality , finger print sensor , Pop up camera, wide angle , 3x zoom and night scape camera. I disappointed a bit by not having a 3.5 mm ear phone jack. Coming to the story of battery life one plus 7 pro is 4000 milliamp which is having 9 hrs 45 minutes battery life where as one plus 6t is 3700 milliamp which is having 10 hrs battery life . I was disappointed with this too. I was totally stunned by the speediness of fingerprint sensor absolutely stunned .  I think everything is fine with the New one plus 7 pro and I am absolutely and delightfully enjoying the experience of New one plus 7 pro . Basically I am a movie lover. I am enjoying the HD movies like I am watching in movie theater. Dolby Atmos sound quality adds this phone to become high priority than others .\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Definitely worth every single Penny spent on it. The display and performance are absolutely mind blowing. Camera may not be the best but it's still top class. The phone isn't as big as people would think it is. It's actually pretty sleek and feels nice in the hands as it isn't very broad. The battery performance is commendable given the 90hz refresh rate and the QHD display. Would easily last a day on normal usage. Although, Heavy users would require around half an hour of charging. Warp charge is super fast, you won't even realise how quickly your phone charges after you plug it in. Oxygen works buttery smooth and as a first time user of this UI, I'm liking it quite a lot. Gaming is wonderful too, absolutely smooth, beautiful and lag free. The accompanying phone cover is good too, it just gets smudged by finger prints though. As someone who watched reviews of different phones and was well versed with what I was buying, I'm enjoying every second of using this phone.Most of the reviewers here are complaining about not receiving headphones and extra covers and a screen guard with bubbles, it's absolutely absurd. You should atleast look over what you're buying first thoroughly, and any reasonable man would have easily found out what he's get in the box and what he's not getting. These illiterate people buy stuff without knowing anything and then expect candies in the damn box and when they don't get it, write negative reviews which influence other queer buyers. It's highly unfortunate.For all those looking for the best performing Device available right now, go for it, if you can compromise with the headphone jack (get a 3.5mm to c type cable and problem solved). Everything from the looks and feel to the performance of the phone is amazing. You'll feel that you're holding a flagship masterpiece every second you're holding this phone. It's easily the best phone in it's price range hands down.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Battery is a weak.. Needs to charge twice a dayAnd apps also keep crashing... In between...Thr is a bug in which lock screen ambient light won't work sumtimes\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Didn't received Bluetooth headphone and car charger with mobile. As it was told in the launch event that one plus seven will give both these products with package.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  SO this phone is probably the best Android phone till date and even better than ios ehen it comes to camera and speed‚ù§Ô∏èI HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST 2 DAYS FOLLOWING ARE THE PROS-1)NO LAG IN GAMING2) ULTIMATELY FAST CHARGING3) THE EDGES ON SCREEN GIVE PREMIUM FEELING4) DUAL SPEAKERS ARE SERIOUSLY USEFUL5) THE TOUCH AND DISPLAY IS VERY SMOOTH6) CAMERA IS A BEAST BOTH FRONT AND BACK CAMERAFOLLOWING ARE CONS-NONE XD AS A CONCLUSION--THE SPEED IS UNMATCHABLE-IN HAND FEEL IS VERY PREMIUM-CAMERA WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN-WARP CHARGING IS VERY QUICKHOPE THIS HELPSüôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Neither a flagship phone nor a flagship killer. It's an expensive joke..  Mi note 5 pro camera is far far better than this idot box.  48 MP camera is a joke.  The tech reviewers gave biased reviews. Don't even try to compare with MI note 7 pro 48MP setup.  Nothing in the product will amaze you,  you will end up with a huge disappointment... Ram management is pathetic,  battery is below average.  Go for google pixel rather than this.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I didn't believe the reviewers. I bought the phone. And now I don't like any other phones except OnePlus 7 Pro.90Hz - It's madness. Imagine this - Drinking alcohol is injurious to health, but if you drink it you'll feel good. Right? 90Hz would give you the best smartphone experience, but it drains some more battery compared to 60Hz. Moderate drinking is perfectly fine; charging the phone 2 times a day is fine too. (I'm a heavy user)Warp charger - Charges the phone at remarkable speeds. If you're a previous OnePlus user, you won't find much of a difference.Camera - Definitely the best, in accordance with pricing.Everything else - as accurate as in the product description.My favorite retarded reviews :*Someone was upset that he couldn't find a 'OnePlus backpack' and a 'OnePlus water bottle' in the package.*Someone was upset that he found an air bubble under the phone's screen guard.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I was a follower of OnePlus but after this phone I am not going to by OnePlus phones anymore. I got screen burning on multiple spots on this phone.Those people call it a gaming phone & when I play games for couple of hours a day it gets screen burning....so what kind of gaming phone is this.I bought Samsung Tab S6 for gaming....this phone just remain as yet another phone\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Big issue with touchscreen..when I try n write it starts video call on wattsapp.. I am trying to write a review the page is closing automatically. After spending 50k if you face such issues, it's disappointing.. I don't know if this issue is because I ordered from Amazon.. I will not recommend this phone to anyone.. I want to return this n want a good phone in working condition or else my refund.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Very disappointed with the product performance and battery life. It's taking more than an hour for full charge in switch off mode and also drains of in just 8 hours. The very new phone started hanging. Is this is what expected from one plus. I need a replace for this phone\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was waiting for this now when i have this in my hands it's just awesome, super design, perfect camera like all models of one plus.A phone from flagship killer to flagship.If anyone really looking to have feel of premium phone then go for it.It's been two days i am using this phone and all good till now, battery, display, speed, sound everything is perfect.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  OnePlus 7pro the best mobile iam using more than 20 mobiles but this mobile is great performance camera performance is the best screen quality is very impressive thanks OnePlus and Amazon ones again\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Touch is not working properly\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Bought on 17th May, worked well for a week, since last 2 days ph not functioning properly, getting hanged. irratic response at time. Can't pick up call , apps switching automatically.Never believe this can happen with  such a brand and such high end Mobile.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Camera quality is normal,Mobile is more weighted in hands,suddenly my call log didn't work properly,night mode does not looks best as well with slowmotion video in low light is worst.battery is better and also the wrap charger doesn't give us wow experience of we are already using dash chargers. Sound is awesome with dual output speakers top and bottom,Mobile finger print sensor is jaw dropping faster.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Upgraded from my OnePlus 6 just a few days back after using OnePlus 6 for about 10 months or so.Initial observation :1. QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. No notch whatsoever.3. Near Stock Android experience.4. OP is great in pushing updates regularly which is a rare thing even with Samsung\\'s flagship phones.Pro\\'s :1.  QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Near Stock Android experience with some very useful features like screen recorder, ability to switch between QHD & FHD+, etc3. Fast Charging (coutsey OPPO\\'s VOOC Charge 3).4. Good ROM options.5. ZEN mode to log you out of the smartphone for 20 minutes.6. Full screen without a notch makes video streaming a great experience.7. Apps open fast, really fast.8. Pop Up camera is really fast during face recognition. Many times you may not even notice that the POP UP camera really came out of the slot retracted. It\\'s that fast.CON\\'s :1. Battery drain gets hampered if you run it in QHD with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Camera is not up to the mark as compared to OnePlus 6 apart from the options of wide angle. (maybe software update will improve its usability, perticularly while shooting videos in wide angle).3 Camera clicks 12 MP shots in default mode. Night mode is so-so but don\\'t compare it with Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL or even with Pixel 3a XL. Pixel is way ahead in terms of resolution perticularly in night mode.4. Day time photos are much better when compared to OnePlus 6 perticularly where good light is not an issue. Photography during \"conference\" might be tricky. This is where Pixel will overshadow all other smartphones.5. This is a big phone in the territory of a tablet. Handling it might be a bit difficult for some. Single hand use is not advisable.Will update after a few more days of use.UPDATE AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF USAGE :Most of the users of OnePlus 7 Pro (as per the reviews) would be happy with budget handset like Redmi or Realme as they are either using OnePlus 7 Pro for the sake of it or to play games. Whether your handset has 2GB RAM free or not has nothing to do with the performance. What makes a difference is the availability of RAM for a perticular task. RAM management is very good like all the previous OnePlus devices.IPhone XS Max also doesn\\'t give a headset or even a dongle to use it with 3.5 mm headphone jack but people do buy iPhone without thinking twice. Iphone doesn\\'t even give fast charging brick in the box. When people can spend a lack of rupees for a brand why complain about OnePlus 7 Pro.Call quality of OP 7 Pro is good. Even video calling over Whatsapp and Skype is good.It\\'s a pleasure using OnePlus 7 Pro for creating Word documents, PPT\\'s, Excel Sheets on the go. These apps use a lot of battery and RAM. Adobe Reader is just fluid. RAM management while using these apps and switching between them is just beautiful and seamless.Will update after a few more days......As expected, OnePlus released an update on the general performance and camera issue.Camera quality is quite subjective and uncontrollable since everyone can capture an awful photo in a random scenario. Even though the photo is not quite bad technically, there is always someone giving negative opinion only for the reason that he likes more appealing photo style. Every time when there is a photo sent to us due to negative feedback, our engineers are requested to find the same light condition and object of same color and texture to simulate the photo in order to reproduce the same problem. You can imagine the time and workload needed for fixing every single problem, not to mention the dozens of photos we got from all over the world everyday. We hope you guys could understand and allow us more time keep working on the camera.ONEPLUS COMMUNITY LISTENS....\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Camera quality is awful. Not worth buying. Can't even return the product\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have tried twice to explain what issues I am facing with this phone but the Amazon call centre are not accepting it.

PEOPLE ARE YELLING ON THE APPLICATION WHICH IS BEING USED TO CHECK THE PHONE the BLANCCO. I am seriously not interested in using this phone. REFUND ME MY MONEY BACK OR ELSE SEND A NEW PHONE TO ME.

I AM WRITING THIS WITHIN THE PERIOD TO REPLACEMENT AND I HAVE TRIED THE CALL CENTRE TWICE. REPLACE ME THE PHONE WITH NEW ONE OR ELSE SEND ME MY MONEY BACK.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  OnePlus 6T was among the fastest Android ever and this time OnePlus has truly gone beyond speed to make one of the best phones of 2019.Pros-1. Display. The major pro is the damn smooth 90 Hz refresh rate along with QHD+ screen. It's as smooth as a butter!2. Ram Boost - The phone learns your behaviour like which apps you use most and accordingly allocates ram towards it making the phone even faster.3. Speed. Nothing to say about this. It's blazing fast.4. Warp charging. The phone gets charged upto 50% in about half an hour and completely in about 75 minutes.5. Completely stoked with the battery after a heavy usage of 9.5 hour screen time with playing games for 2 hours and using Netflix for 7 hours in a single charge.Cons-1. Including camera here for the time being until a major update comes our and improves the camera firmware. As of now, not a flagship camera by miles.2. Lack of IP rating, not that it matters to me. The phone's tested enough in water.3. Lack of wireless charging. Again, not felt as a con because of warp charging, but still.Conclusion: If you can wait for a while for the camera to be improved and don't mind the above cons, definitely go for it.

Is it good to take people hard earned money and become rich with all this schemes , before amazon was never like this . You can check call records even I have contacted your company executives not once but twice. Days passed and it the 16th day of this phone the phone has an issue as when I using an app like watsapp while texting it opens the profile of the person whom I am texting , plus it opens up the the other app . I don't know what problem is this . I urged your executive even that mamm I don't require the money , I would be ordering iPhone XR but then also she said a clear no . Experience WD one plus flagship phone is getting pathetic with every passing day.Regards,A genuine customer who has been using Amazon to buy online product always but this experience made me felt disgusted and pathetic.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have received a handset with a faulty mic, as soon as i m on call the person on the other hand seems to have disturbance in the voice call this happen when i m on mic as soonnas i switch to speakers it vanishes and everything works fine but the thing is i have purcahsed a phone to make a normal call not speaker call. I have been to the service store they said take the back up of the phone and hand over to us. It means that ordering the device early is stupidity. Now it can happen they will open the phone and the water proof pressure will be damaged, not happy at all.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Got my hands on the first prime day sale and arrived two days later.This phone is a fresh breath of air the. The OS is silky smooth  and no lag whatsoever . One plus did an excellent job with their oxygen OS with great optimization . The 90 Hz display makes the experience much more better . You can change it to typical 60 Hz for a long lasting battery hours but who cares when you have a 90hz display. Browsing and scrolling is super smooth and playing games is a bliss thanks to the snapdragon 855 SoC . Been using it for the past two days and the battery life is good . Gets you throughout the day without excessive game play sessions and the latest UFS 3.0 provides blazing fast data transfer.  I get an average of 8 hr of screen on time with full charge and speaking of charging the latest warp charge charges the device from 40 to 100 in around 25 minutes which is fast. I am happy with the device as it is my first one plus device . Looking forward to using it for more than 2 years.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is my first ever Android phone, after being an iPhone user for over a decade. The device is superb and fast. Apps work like breeze and overall, Oxygen OS feels clean and fast like iOS. There are several stability issues that I've seen. Most notably, things like the fingerprint scanner do not always work as expected, the double tap feature doesn't always work and the curvature of the screen leads to unwanted taps. The 48Mp camera is pretty good indeed however, I've noticed an occasional focusing issue that prevents the camera from focussing correctly under certain conditions.But I guess Android phones are never perfect simply because their software is not particularly built for the hardware. So, I'm pretty cool with these issues so far, unless something escalates further. Overall, I'm very impressed by the device. Its well built, charges quickly, takes good photos, sounds well and performs well.What I'm more interested in seeing are these minor glitches go away with OTA updates as is popular in the OnePlus community. Apple has never been very responsive to minor complaints and their updates take ages to appear. OnePlus, from what I've heard is very responsive to customer complaints and I'm hoping things become better with upcoming updates.Till then I'm finding 1 - 2 star reviews on Amazon really amusing with people reporting things like a missing screen cleaning cloth, wireless headphones. Get a life people, and buy these on your own.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Great choice over S10 Plus.Amazing display and smooth experience with 90Hz refresh rate, which can only be experience while using.Battery gives more than 4 Hours of screen time with 90Hz.Superfast charging with WARP charger.Extremely fast and no log switching between apps and playing games.Outstanding camera which clicks quite decent pics in both day and night.Overall best phone from OnePlus till now. Worth purchase with no cons.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  One plus 7 pro is an awesome phone no doubts.I am a very strong Apple fan, still i used 99% apple products.I have iphone too, but openly say compare to one plus 7 pro, i phone is nothing.Superb camera,superb perfomance.8 gb ram and 256 gb storage capacity around 52, 000/-.Both front and back cameras are awesome.Good phone for gaming people also.Good wide display.Good sound quality.Superb design.No doubts this is best phone in market now.One plus have good brand name too.What I dislike is 1.) Little over weight. 2.)Battery life not that much better.(One day average)3)No headphone Jacket or head phone with this phone.All other features are superb, inbuilt call record, app lock etc etc.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Loved itI liked everything in this mobileIt is smooth, fast, powerfulThe latest Oxygen OS.ALL ARE SUPERI liked very much is it's PREMIUM DISPLAY.....You feel yourself as superior.1+ is a brand that no one can beat or at least touch.Some rival companies are saying that flagship killer is coming but I would say you can never beat a Oxygen OS......If you are affordable for this just blindly go for the pro .......Even if you feel it as expensive, gather money & definitely go for this.There are some minor quality issues with cameraBut surely by the time you read this review 1+ would have definitely posted an update and fixed those small thingsüôÇ.........Never compare 1+ with other brands they are not even worth to sit beside 1+.........You definitely get these thoughts like me after having this phone in your hands............Feel free to ask your queries .......\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I felt bad only on one thing regarding the delivery of the product..I ordered the product on 16th May in early sale for prime members and it was supposed to be deliver on next day 17th May 2019 before 9 pm. But I recieved the product in Monday 20th May only..it was such a very bad experience with Amazon Becz even though I was a prime customer I recieved the product very late.. I raised many issues and complaints within that date to get the product on time. I felt very bad about the delivery service of Amazon team..Note regarding the beast and flagship of 2K19.. we happy to buy one plus product again. I was already using one plus 6 for the last 8 months. Always the one plus is so fast and good in performance and built quality. The same and with more performance and balanced Battery back up in the new one plus 7 pro. The box itself was awesome. The phone build quality is remarkable. The display is the main highlight of the product such an awesome clarity and movie experience on the phone. The fast movement with 90hz is really awesome. Felt like new whenever I use the phone. Camera quality has been improved a lot. Day time the photos are awesome and the new nightscape is also good .. The front camera is better and fast. Overall I can give 8.5/10 for camera Becz there is still some lag in picture quality and the contrast of colours while taking a picture when compared to other flagship mobiles. Next the most fastest indisplay finger print is speechless.. no lag or no delay even in extreme dark.. happy that the one plus products are always awesome and they are continuously improving the products. The battery was little bit okay for me im getting just 5 hours of screen time only. But I Hope that the upcoming updates will improve the battery life. So I can give 8/10 for battery and 10/10 for performance. The animation is also awesome whenever we open the phone through finger print the live wallpaper is remarkable. Overall I'm very much happy to buy this awesome product only I felt little bad about the price and there was no connector for earphones. The price is not too high but I expected little less. Anyways this is the new beast of 2K19. Since I won't be playing that much games so I bought 6gb variant Becz last time I bought 8gb variant it will be even more faster but drains the battery fastly. So I decided to go on with 6gb. I recommend everyone to buy this flagship killer and those who will use the phone for more personal and normal use they can easily go with 6gb variant\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  A great premium flagship smartphone.Pros:üëâThe DisplayüëâSnappy UI InterfaceüëâOxygen OS (FASTER UPDATES)üëâAn above average camera( can be better with G-cam mod and future updates )üëâVibration hapitc motor feels more premiumConsüëâA bit pricy , but that display !üëâProne to damages can be solved by buying a caseüëâNo wireless charging but you do get a 30W chargerüëâNo ip water resistant although it is water proof check YouTube videos for water tests Op7pro.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Fastest Android phone on Earth!Samsung, Redmi, Apple, etc etc...

Camera in portrait mode isn't that sharp.2. I am not exactly aware of how the liquid cooling system works. Phone got hot a couple of times. But bearable heating.3. The curved screen isn't of any use. So no idea why OP has done this. Though the phone looks premium with it.4. No 3.5 jack. The only genuine complaint I have. I tried hard to find a good quality type c-3.5 mm connector. Otherwise one will always rely on Bluetooth headphones.Overall, a phone worthy of praise and purchase.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Highly over priced\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's a great device I have been using it for a month now... believe me it's completely value for money...it's super snappy buttery smooth...yes it's a little heavier than usual...and battery life is not that good but why complain when u have warp charge it charges you device hell fast...and honestly u will get 24 hours of average battery life...it's great for gaming no heating issue pubg runs at highest graphics...and believe me 90hz refresh rate makes the gaming scrolling supper smooth...the display is great I'd say it's one of the best in the business üòÅ...AND PEOPLE U WON'T GET EARPHONES AND CAR WARP CHARGER WITH THIS AS SHOWN IN YOUTUBE THOSE ARE CREATOR'S BOX THEY ARE ONLY SENT TO BIG CONTENT CREATORS...yes they should have provided a 3.5mm to USB c connector but I bought a OnePlus bullet wired and it's fine u can also buy 3.5mm to USB c convertor from OnePlus official site it costs around 400rs...the fingerprint reader works great..THE CAMERA QUALITY WAS NOT GOOD AT 1ST BUT AFTER 2 UPDATES ITS GREAT...ITS ALSO SPLASH RESISTANT... maximum people are reviewing this after 2-3 days of use but the phone deserves 4 stars....watch YouTube reviewers like MKBHD, Dev2d, unbox therepy...AND OXYGEN OS IS CLOSE TO STOCK ANDROID AND NO BLOATWARE IS LOADED IT WILL WORKTHE SAME SNAPPY AND SMOOTH EVEN AFTER 2-5 YEARS...the pop up camera has free fall detection which is great it closes once the phone slips from your hand...it's has UFS 3.0 storage the first in the world which makes it faster than all the phones and games also load super fast...it also contains first FLUID AMOLED DISPLAY...JUST BUY IT... IT'S GREAT PHONE.. THANK YOU\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I'm using this phone since past 3 days. So, here goes:1. Great display. The curved edges and no-notch display is a great head turner. The large screen makes browsing a great experience.2. Smooth UI. No bloatware whatsoever. No nagging notifications. Very smooth and highly customizable UI.3. Decent Camera. I am not much of a shutterbug. But the snaps I clicked were fantastic. Maybe photography enthusiasts will be able to give a better review on this aspect.4. Nice battery life. Easily lasted 1 and a half day with full charge. And the warp charge is a beaut.5. A little heavy. But we can get used to it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I just upgraded from OnePlus 5tDisplay- the best display on any smartphone!I saw the good reviews on this mobile's display but damn! I didn't expect it to be this good!, I have a S10 in my home for comparison and I can surely say this is as good as Samsung'sBuild- I waited for nebula blue and it's worth the wait! It looks awesome, build quality is excellent but a bit hefty but manageable and u will get used to it in one dayCamera- this is the main part, I don't know whether it's due to my low expectations on camera due to all the negativity but I'm genuinely surprised with the camera, even for this I compared it with S10 and it's pretty close to S10, low light photography is a major improvement and it's on par with S10 which is considered as best in low light other than HuaweiSo don't believe all the negativity, I wonder people who are putting negative review are using DSLR for their daily photo needs.. the only negative would be the wide angle lens is not upto the mark and the one on S10 is way betterVery happy with the camera..Battery- way better than my 5t and easily getting upto 7hrs of screen on time with moderate to heavy usage and warp charge is the best!Performance- no need to say specially about performance coz it's OnePlus!855 with 90hz display, the fastest phone in the world!Others- call quality excellent, sound output via Bluetooth excellent, fingerprint sensor excellent, vibration feedback excellent, no ip rating but totally waterproof.Overall an excellent package and it's worth the premium price!Important note: 3x telephoto lens will not be active if the object is at less than 50cm distance from the lens and in very low light scenarios in such cases the main sensor is used for zoom for better quality...\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am writing the review after using the product for one week.1. Display & Hardware : That's probably the first thing you'll notice about the phone. There is a massive 6.67-inch screen. (too much for me). The design is rich and lusturous.There is an anti-glare coating at the back which gives a matte-like finish. The all-screen design makes the display amazing. Also, it is the first phone of the brand to offer Quad HD+ Fluid AMOLED panel. And most importantly, the screen is curved on both edges (like recent Samsung flagships).What makes the phone truly stand out is the 90Hz refresh rate. The display is also rated for HDR10+2. Camera : There's a primary 48MP f/1.6 camera backed by an 8MP telephoto lens and 16MP wide-angle shooter.The wide-angle lens offers a 117-degree field of view, and the 8MP telephoto delivers 3x optical zoom. And it is just amazing!! The camera is works amazing in daylight conditions. The night-mode is also good, but don't expect it to compete the Pixel 3 and galaxy S10s. Also, the pop up camera is an amazing addon!!3. Software : You really don't need the review for that.But few good things are- native screen recorder, OxygenOS 9.5, Fnatic Mode and Sen mode.4. Processing : The device is fast, really fast. From face recognition to 90Hz display to OxygenOS' clean interface. It is the fastest device I've ever used. (8/256 Version)5. Battery Life : The OnePlus 7 Pro has a 4000mAh battery, but because of the 90Hz display, I struggled to last it for a day. also, the  Warp Charge delivers a 30W charge. You'll be able to charge from 0-50% in just over 20 minutes, and up to 50% in 30 minutes while gaming.6. Weight : The large screen and the 4000 mAh battery leads to 206g weight. The OnePlus 7 Pro feels too top-heavy, and that makes the device unwieldy.7. Major Cons- too heavy, massive screen, no earphones included (paying 53k, I expected earphones), night mode camera is fairly average, no wireless charging, No IP rating , No 3.5 mm jack.Final verdict - I am postively biased for OnePlus always. But yes, since the price range has moved significantly, the expectations from the device have been significantly increased as well. Still this is one of the most ambitious phones, I've ever used. So, please go and buy it!.P.S. Personal review!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Awesome premium end deviceNot for everyoneProsDisplay is the standout feature,better than my ipad2018, better than s10 plus at affordable pricePhone is sleekTriple camera just take beautiful picturesFront pop is the next gen camera for full screenCharging is faster than dash charging omgLooks 100/100Must buy good cover phone is slipperyPop camera has free fall detection n works excellentIts a big 6.67 phone not for small hand usersIts touch ,day to day use  is so fast,smooth and responsive thank you once again for your new deviceTrue oneplus fan ,and proud owner of OnePlusCons :Nothing much as of now will update review after monthPhone has outplayed samsung and close to apple but half the price of apple\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  1st biggest problem- FINGER PRINT SCANNER - my friend can open this phone by using his finger print with registering his fingerprint in this phone ...not even one time..more than 10 times he opened infornt of me...which is unexpected...we are using our finger print for all type of transaction....this type of security glith is not acceptable from oneplus(flagship killer).2nd issue- 90HZ DISPLAY- not worth...display flickers sometime after changing to 90hz...in this 8 days more than 15 times i faced hanging/lagging  issue.3rd issue- AUTO BRIGHTNESS  is not at all working properly.4th issue- this type of CAMERA u can get in 15k phones.5th issue- SCRREN GUARD- After paying 53k ,i didnt expect this type of screen guard...in 2 days,it came out.PHONE IS SO BIG AND HEAVY....53K Iz too much for this type of family.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Amazing phone with lots of improvement over 6t.. definitely a worthy purchase.. also i loved the wide angle camera a lot,although camera needs an improvement..amazing display and 90hz refresh rate is so damn smooth and screen quality is so damn good easily comparable with Samsung s10..overall i loved that feel and smoothness..I Love you one plus.. üíì\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  24x7 mobile is very hot.cant even hold in handAlso battery dries very fast\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The purchase and delivery was excellentNow about product, the camera is awesome, the performance is great..I haven't used any other night end phone like Samsung and iphone to compare this with those. But I like the OnePlus phone so far\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  \\xa0From day one it gives problems.Hang, from last 3 hours it's showing restarting.Many basic apps crash like google chrome and WhatsApp. even its own camera hangs many timevoice problem during loudspeaker.  10k to 12k phone is much better than this oneI am suggesting you don't buy this product. its wastage of money\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have been an Iphone user ever since Iphone was launched, i tried phones but could not even hold on to anyother for more than 3-4 days.With op7pro has done an awesome work.Camera, screen and typing is as good as iphone even better in camera.5 star.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Point1.Fast and buttery smoot- its so fast and smooth that you can hardly tell its opening the simple application or resuming it from ram.2.Display - 90hz display with FHD+ resolution will spoil you, it will literally make u swipe up n down without any reason.3.Speaker - Good stereo speakers will enhance your media consumption experience.4.Battery - Getting good battery life , on an avg 7 hrs SOT with gaming abt 3hrs.5.Weight n size - Size doesn't bother me n yeah its lil heavy however i guess i ll get use to it.- one downside it that if u drop it prone to break due to its heavness.6.IP rating - Not n issue, its tested by manu YouTuber ,i.e it can survive lil water and anyway no company gives you warranty against water damage.7.WI-fi - Geting the speed ISP provide. So no issue.8. Wireless charging - Fast charging is enough.9.Camera - Decent not as good as pixel. Can improve with gcam .This is the area one plus needs to improve.10.No headphone jack- really missing that , i hv Bluetooth earphone but in gameplay u need wired headset or else it gt lilbit delay via Bluetooth so bought a dongle n getting use to it.11.Anything extra will incurred the cost also so at this price point all acceptable.All points are mentioned are according to personal my experience n views.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I received a faulty phone, network and WiFi connection goes on and off automatically. And When I called Amazon they said first their technician will check in next 3 days and after that replacement process will go on till that I have to wait, don't knw how long it going to take üò†üò†üò†I used it for two days and noticably Battery and camera performance is poor not a flagship level of course.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have been using this phone for last 2 days and must say that it is the beast (not just best) among the premium phones.The speed with which the page opens with your fingerprint and apps switches happen, the clarity and quality of the videos and the ultra loud but crystal clear speaker sound can beat many phones of better range any day. You can bet on it. The Samsung S series like curves at vertical edges of 6.67\" large screen and no bezels gives the phone very rich looks. By far the best OnePlus till date.The 4000 mAH battery lasts throughout the day with more than average screen time but the charging is again super quick (30 to 100% in less than 20 mins)Using gestures feels awesome and gives more screen space on already a very large screen.Camera is still under testing so no comments, however initial pictures looks very good.So for a new phone I rate it 5. Let\\'s see & review it\\'s performance after 3-4 months into use\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I received a new OnePlus 7 Pro just yesterday, and when I tried to add both my sim cards in it, I found out the second sim slot was too small to add even a nano SIM card.After spending a day going from one shop to another to have my sim cut and everyone saying it was too small already, I found someone with the same phone, and they opened their sim card tray and said mine was defective.What kind of pathetic service is this?!This has not only made me not want to shop for anything on Amazon, but also has made me hate the brand OnePlus.OnePlus's call centers are also not customer friendly.I recommend people not to buy this or any OnePlus device, because in such a situation you'll eaither be phoneless (during the period Amazon replaces it) or you'll have wasted such a huge amount on a defective phone, with no help from OnePlus.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  \\xa0I got this phone on 3rd June and just within a week's time I am facing battery related issues.Do not rush into buying this phone, wait for a while more and ask other OnePlus users if they are facing the same issues.  Maybe I got a defected piece . They even refused for a replacement. All they did was a 5 minute video check where in if the phone battery drops then 5% they replace else they dont.Just go through the video and you shall understand the entire scenario.Feel as if 50k wasted.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Time for a 7 pro review, I have used for 14 days now, so after using this giving review. Let me tell you one plus 7 pro is the worlds first fastest phone. 7 pro gives you premium feel, display is unbeatable, look wise this is the most beautiful, sexiest beast till date. There are many Indian you tuber spreading negative reviews of this phone but I tell you if you really wanna decide by review then watch out side Indian you tuber videoes. Yes price of this on high side as compared to oppo Reno, redmi k20 pro but you have to decide if you want to save extra 6k to 8k or you want a premium feel of a smartphone. If yes this phone is for you, if you really want to save money then you can go for 6gb variant also comes with same features, but nebula blue is still sexiest colour. Camera is also damm good, battery life is also good, performance is best. I was one plus 5t user before having this phone so performance wise one plus is best, just go for 7 pro rather than oppo Reno or redmi k20 pro, I bet you 7 pro is the worth buy. You won't regret after buying this beast. This is the world's first fastest, sexiest phone. Just go for it....\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  No doubt regarding the phone's performance. However, the pre-applied screen protector is filled with bubbles and dust particles and seems like someone unprofessional has been applying these! I request you to please look into it and provide me with a possible solution as it has totally ruined the experience of owning a flagship and getting this kind of service!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  For one I really do like the phone...coming to details the fingerprint reader is a tiny bit slow...but it has numerous unlocking options that work simultaneously...facelock is good...zone / location based is a good feature(though it's not new) overall fingerprint does not make that much an impact.Speed is good.For screen it's very good but for a gamer the buttons on the boundaries do make it a bit difficult to operate but once you get used to it it's ok.Rear camera is very good can't say it's excellent. Front camera should have had more resolution and lighting option.Battery is good for a workhorse like this if you are a gamer expect 40% remaining battery by 3 pm. But the charger is way damn good in 20 min you are back to 90%...Headphones should have been provided, but I use wireless anyways...Tempered Screen protector should have come preapplied instead of the plastic one. mine is developing wrinkles because of gaming...OnePlus phones offer lots of customisation option if one needs and knows how....have seen lots of people not using customisation at all.Overall it's a good phone and a welcome change.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Powerfully conceived and surely is a great upgrade for those replacing a phone after 2+ years. Processor is great, audio is loud and clear. Price is on the higher end but a worthy deal for people intense on email, social media and fast communication. Miss the 3.5mm jack or the in case wired headset but battery and display makes it up. Had it been, wireless charging could have taken this far further but love the warp charging. Fast fingerprint recognition and selfie camera allows decent face recognition. Oneplus has greatly enhanced the Android underneath. Worthy call if you need speed & quality.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Owesome sound by Dolby Atmos üëå, fingerprint sensor is super,fuild amyloid display is mind blowing,back cover perfectly fits.colourful theme is added including black and white themes which is superb.In built screen recorder in good.90hz refresh rate is smooth and fast.coming to draw backs there is no slot for ear phones we have to buy c type cable which connects earphones.and the screen guard doesn't stick at ends were phone curves not a big problem and the price 53k think if your phone is lost then you will be heartbroken I lost my one plus 3t which costs 30k.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  nothing special except screen\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  First of All Amazon You might have became the worlds best company but Kindly Focus on your customer service or you will lose thousands of customers just because of your service. Come To mObile.You can see that i have 3 one plus device. I bought One plus 7 pro mirror black 6+128 model.With The use of 10 days.2-3 days normal working i am not a Big fan of Games or Hd videos or like this i just put 30-40 normal productivity apps in the mobile.After 3 days Battery starts drainning i thought with update this issue will be solved but inwas wrong With in 10 days my fingerprint was not working, And On 10 Thday my Phone Was dead. Its not even power on guys ya I said it right.Is this we got in 49000 rupees. This should not be done. Mobile Phone is very overpriced it should have At ‚Çπ40000.Now come to Customer service part,I am calling from Last 10 days to amazon Customer Care they make false promises and just do formality Which they did with me.Finally i sent my mobile on my own courier expemse to company.Thats it kindly save your money And put it on right place\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  When there is a video call camera pops up while it is ringing, it should have been camera popping up when I accept the call. This put the selfie camera on risk if the phone is in your pocket n it starts ringingCalled up one plus service centre the answer that I got was this would get resolve when there would be a software update but by that time your camera could get affected\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This is what I am upset for Amazon product I am very irritating about this product what the hell YouTube also not working well\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Awesome phone... I m giving this feedback after using it 4 days...Pros: Camera quality is awesome... It's rear camera is better than iphone x (I am also using iphone x)...No lag... It's as fast as iPhone x...Battery back up is awesome...Display quality is awesome...Lighting fast charging...Cons: No led notification...No separate headphone jack... Because of it's c type charging point I hv 2 purchase c type port for using any 3.5 mm jack headphone...For this reason I give 4 out of 5...\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am a oneplus fan (previously owned oneplus 2, 5t than 7pro) but this time I must say that OnePlus misguided about the camera, the S10's 16 MP camera produces far more better pictures than 7pro's 48 MP camera in every scenario, really disappointed with this purchase, I should have gone for the S10 instead.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  'One plus 7 pro fast, smooth and effortlessly powerful' as mentioned, or did the phone failed to live the hype. I am among those first mortals who got a chance to laid hands on this beautiful peice of technology and below are my findings after a week of use.Pros:1: Display- One of the bet that really paid off is the new edge to edge display in this phone, no bezels, no notch on the screen mean more screen to body ratio which looks quite stunning. However I am not facinated about the full screen display, I mean, yeah it's great but you can find this kinda tech in many sub premium phones available out there. The big surprise this time is the bump in resolution, the phone now sports a  6.67 Inch, 2K+ resolution OLED Display which was long needed since screen to body ratio has increased reasonably since One plus 3t and given the price tag. Another +ve side is fluid AMOLED with 90hz refresh rate, it's not cosmetic and I can say that because I am using a oneplus 3t along side this phone and I can easily see the difference in the screen response in 7pro, the animations are silky smooth, fast and flawless. Also another unique trait is this screen has got side edge display as like Samsung's edge series. All in all the display ticks all the boxes, no questions.2- Memory and storage: I am using a 12 GB ram n 256 GB rom version, given the amount of ram multitasking glitches are the things of past. I tested it's performance by parallely running nfs, pubg, asphalt nitro, clash of clans without any hiccups where as 3t faces some issues, thus heavy performance apps can run smoothly as the phone can take that all easily. Also 256 GB storage is enough to store images, vedios and files etc, given that we are living in cloud era.3 Speed: Speed has always been a trump card for oneplus  phones, and it's the imperative reason of it's existence. Even my 2 years old oneplus 3t never showed any noticeable lagg and 7 pro is no exception. Also this time the company has introduced liquid cooling to address over heating issues faced by early oneplus phones, however I still found some heating issue while playing multiple performance games but in normal day to day use it's just ok. This beast takes all performance load with ease, so stay relaxed this phone won't let you down.Cons:1: Camera: There is marginal improvement in the camera department from 6t but I didn't found anything much as mentioned in ads, I compared the shots with my friend's shots takes by s10+ and the later one stands out in terms of quality and wide view angle. S10+ camera on paper is low on megapixels but does better justice than one plus. Night pics are a slight better I can say, else Samsung's done a good job here.2 - Pop up front camera: This point may not appease to all the readers but I am not a fan of machanized camera. Even oneplus suggest not to use face unlock much. There is also another clever peice of tech here by oneplus, if accidentally the phone drops out of your grip while the the front camera is still out, the phone will automatically detect the fall by using the inbuilt gyroscope and immediately pops the camera inside even before the phone touches the ground. However given all these corks and screwes, I still doubt the front camera may show signs of break downs in the long run.3- Missing headphone jack- While there are few people complaining about missing headphone jack, I personally don't feel it's a loss as I rarely use wired earphones and also I noticed most of my friends too use Bluetooth earphones. Wired earphones are the things of the past, get yourself a pair of good Bluetooth earphones and bingo! u won't miss the jack anymore.4- Finger print scanner- Strangely the inscreen finger print scanner some time fail to recognize if you fingers are slightly moist due to sweat.Summary- Bit pricey when compared to the recently launched oneplus 7, but in terms of features and looks it's leagues ahead not just from it's own siblings but with most of the competitions as well.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It's a oneplus phone and it gives more than what it has promised. The speed, options, video quality and ease of access all leaves you feeling royal.But in addition I loved Amazon service. I had exchanged my old phone for this and it was such a breeze. I faced no issues and was able to get the phone I wanted in record time. It's just 24 hrs since I first ordered the phone on Amazon and it's already set up and working as usual.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is the best phone from one plus ! For the price it checks all the boxes of flagship ! Been using for a week ! Everything flows and lovely to use it .if you are looking for a perfect phone with best display and good camera best software experience , I would recommend one plus 7 pro , as it's the best phone with reasonable price ! It's been a ride from one plus one to 7 pro and really happy one always pushes a step further ! You get none other than the best smartphone !Pros:Display the fluid display is awesome.Sound now you got that dual speaker set up , not so loud but clear and precise.Camera is goodBattery lasts more than a day with a normal usageGaming is awesome on the phoneHaptic feedback is much improved and much love for that.Last but not least a fast smooth software experience.Cons :Large phone it's about 7 inch phone very hard to use one handedly but I am willing to learn it.The curved edge corners are not perfectly rendering the data of 3rd party apps , hope this will be fixed in software updates.No headphones jack , I have so many headphones which are useless now .\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Very good and excellent using From past two days received on 17th of may , no issues with phone battery backup Good no heating, refresh rate too fastValue for MoneyPop up Selfie Camera is Great.Battery Life is Pretty Good.Music Sound System is Very Good.Inprint Finger sensor is Fast and good to unlock the phone\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I was so confused in between S10+ and OP7 Pro because i was worried about weight and camera but both are excellent. I am glad that i opted OnePlus7 Pro. The moment i turned on the display i was simply amazed by its quality, seriously it's just pleasure to eyes to watch and feel this display.Other than this performance, camera, OS, and premium look of Nebula blue all are just amazing.Go for it and trust me you not gonna regret it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The mobile received on 14th of August and the screen started flickering on 20th September. The service centers declared that liquid damage is the reason and the cost will be 17000.00. Now, how can a person prove that it was not dip on water and its already water splash proof as declared on amazon. Very poor service and will not recommend for one+ series.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have buy this phone on the first when it come on amazon for sale. but after comparing this oneplus 7 pro camera with old oneplus 6 and oneplus 6t they have much batter camera then this op7 pro. but they are avalabile in 32999/- and i have spent 53000/- almost 20000 for this phone but i am not happy with this phone camera.i cant return this product because i have purchase this phone on bajaj emi. but now i am feeling cheated by oneplus india.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Friends ordered this phone and received in just 2 days time. Very much happy with the purchase. Heard a lot of negative complaints like camera, phantom touch, slow fingerprint etc. Which phone haven't has that. But this one really lived up to my expectations. The issues with this phone will definitely go away with updates, I received the first update and there is development in camera quality. I haven't had any experience of phantom touch and poor fingerprint yet. The display is very punchy and accurate. OnePlus development team is very active and will provide all updates to optimise this phone..so go for it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  First of all i m using ONE PLUS for the first time. The phone performance is mind blowing, no lag nothing at all.üñ•Ô∏èThe Display is so awesome, u will fall in love with it. üòçüòçüì∑ Camera is gud bt still it requires improvement in my viewüîã Battery is Good, i think due to big screen it consume battery a little faster, bt after updates it will be fixed definitely..üéÆGame lover Go for it no doubt..And dont think for negative review. I dont knw why people are so stupid.. üòÇ\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Works like a charm little hefty but butter smooth.And for people talking about incomplete product delivery what you see on youtube is reviewers unit jot retail unit so stop with the dumb comments.My only complaint is that there is no headphone in the box and nor did the company provide the adaptor for the same\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's a beautiful beast. Screen is the best . No notch and no hole , the view is clear and you enjoy it. Oxygen Os is always like a stock android which is the best. Camera is okay. But yes I think they should have added type c 3.5 mm converter out of the box in such price segment.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The first thing firstThe design is awesome.Specs are awesomeAnd almost near to stock android is also awesome.This mobile is just super fast.I think spending 50k + on this is better than spending on Samsung items.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Overall Beast as everyone says!! but few things i have noticed after usage since a week..firstly i wud say RAM is being used drastically.. just for normal usage it wud consume approx 5 to 6 GB RAM without any reason.. i dunno how does that processing work at all...and battery is drastically draining since 2 days.. earlier 5 days were EPIC.. now i really do not understand what the problem is.. as the usage is same as before. planning to get it replaced but wat if it works the same!!!Camera app is not at all good. thy really need to upgrade their software to match the market level phones like pixel and nokia.Overall little disappointed with 12 GB Beast phone... Expectations were high but lets hope for the best for further usage..EDIT :  After 20plus days of usage and 2 updates working really fine and battery issue also resolved with some apps management. Now battery works upto 36 to 48 hrs for one single charge. Will update more once after i use it liitle extensively for few more days... Stay tuned!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I had been using my OnePlus 3T since December 2016. The device was still good enough for my daily necessities but the battery life dropped down to a considerable extent so I decided to get the OnePlus 7 Pro. My expectations were quite high, and guess what? This phone gracefully rose past all of them. Here is my review after three weeks of usage. Trust me, I've used the stuffing out of the device in these three weeks.Desirable features :1. Display : Arguably the phone's strongest selling point. My mind was shuttling between the 7T and 7 Pro and the display is what sold by. Beautiful Quad HD curved display with 90 Hz refresh rate. Curved displays may not be for everyone, but I've condoned them since the s6 edge and hence, I personally love it. Accidental touches are also very rare (I do have fat fingers). As for the refresh rate, it improves the overall user experience and if you don't believe me, keep a phone with a 60 Hz screen next to this and you will definitely observe the difference. The screen is pretty bright and has legit outdoor visibility as well. Night and reading modes also ensure you have a pleasant experience using it in the dark. Screen flickering is not noticeable for the average user but you have the DC dimming option as well if in case you do notice it.2. Software optimization : Oxygen OS is OnePlus' forte. Undisputedly the best OS available for android. It is buttery smooth and packed with just the right amount of features. I didn't feel the need for a third party launcher. Rest assured, you will definitely receive regular software updates for three years at least.3. Performance : Moving from the 3T, this felt like riding a H2R after owning a splendour all my life. I haven't noticed any lags or stutters no matter what task I threw at it. As for gaming, I've saved it for the end of the review. PUBG lovers do check out the bottom of the review for a detailed PUBG review. Spoiler alert : it outperforms even some of the gaming phones on the market today.4. Audio output : The dual stereo speakers are very loud. The clarity is excellent for listening to media and taking calls as well. Dolby Atmos is the cherry on top of the cake.5. Camera : Many reviews said that the camera was a disappointment. Well, OnePlus seems to have fixed it with numerous updates because when I got my device and installed all the updates, the camera performance was splendid. Pro mode allows you to tweak the settings considerably. Slow motion videos are good too, though not the best. Any normal user would be very happy with the camera as I had no complaints. it doesn't beauty or oversaturate images. Initially, when I opened slow motion at night in indoor lighting, the screen was flickering and so did the resulting video. But it turns out it is not a manufacturing defect. The sensor cannot shoot slow motion videos on certain lighting conditions. But it works well in outdoor lighting. So if you try it for the first time indoors, do not freak out if this happens. Video recording at 4k;60fps is awesome too.TIP : Use Pro mode to click RAW images and then edit them on Snapseed. RAW files produce excellent details but also range from 20-30 MB per image. They are a little soft but Snapseed is all you need to edit the images.6. Network reception : Network reception and Wi-Fi speed is also much better. Internet speed is much better on this phone as compared to my older devices (3T and Mi A2 lite).7. Warp charging : It charges from 0 to 100 in just about an hour's time. And the best part is, the phone doesn't heat up at all. Only the adapter gets warm, but the phone doesn't heat up despite the charging speed.8. Design - The phone looks beautiful and feels premium. The notchless display is a treat to the eyes. I have the nebula blue variant and the frosted glass back looks magnificent. It feels great to hold and even better to behold.Well, this phone does everything you expect from a phone perfectly. So the pros list would go on and on.Could be better :Battery life - OnePlus packs a 4000 maH battery. It will easily last you through the day even if you are a heavy user. I get 6-7 hours of screen on time normally and a little over 5 hours if I do a lot of gaming and YouTube. I have my display set at 9 Hz and 1440p resolution so this does pull a lot off the battery. But considering the size and weight of this phone, OnePlus could have provided us with a battery. I did try setting the screen to 60 Hz and 1080p and it improved the battery life by roughly 15-20%, but what's the point of having such a powerful display and not being able to exploit it to the fullest?Liabilities :1. No headphone jack - When I buy a premium phone, I expect the company to at least pack a type C to 3.5mm adapter, if not a type C headphones. Come on, even apple gives you compatible earphones in the box. I spent an extra 390 bucks for the adapter. It works fine but would have been better if it came in the box.2. Tempered glass - OnePlus gives you an applied screen protector with the phone and it is good, but it is not shatterproof. When you have an expensive display, it is always better to secure it with a good tempered glass. But finding a good one is a pain. Either it has black edges, doesn't cover the screen completely, or the application process is a hassle and error prone. And they cost at least four times the amount for flat screen phones. Have ordered one from glazedinc, let's hope it fits the bill.A few perks :To make the phone look better, I downloaded wallpapers from unsplash. I also installed the flight icon pack (free version). You don't need a separate launcher for it, Oxygen OS allows you to use icon packs and it is quite simple. You can customize the icons and even change the name of the apps(useful if you want to be shady).Also installed an edge screen app. Have attached a screenshot of my home screen. Also, enable dark mode. The display makes it beautiful.Set animation scale in developer options to 0.5x for an even snappier experience.I suggest you use the fingerprint scanner and avoid face unlock as the front camera has to pop up Everytime you need to unlock your phone. Besides it is very accurate and fast too. I've disabled finger unlock animation so make it seem faster (perception hack).Verdict :I have the 8GB RAM/256GB ROM version.  It is worth the 43 grand damage. Given a second chance, I'd still pick the same phone again and I am sure you would too. After all, it won the MVP award in MKBHD's smartphone awards 2019. :)PUBG Mobile review :This is an absolute beast of a phone for PUBGM. Default settings itself was set to HDR + Extreme and it handled it very well. Constant 60 fps was achieved with minor drops to 58 and never below that. I personally prefer to play at Smooth + Extreme as bullets register the fastest in these settings (as said by professional players). I'm a four finger claw + full gyroscope player. I picked up full gyro practicing for just two weeks in this phone. Touch response is super quick and there are no multi touch issues. Gyro response is also perfect and I play with the same sensitivity as Snax. My gameplay has improved a lot with this phone. Curved display wasn't an issue for me at all. You also have an in built screen recorder that records both internal and external audio. Recording your gameplay doesn't affect the performance at all. Minor heating is noticeable after two classic matches if you're recording. 5 minutes of recording at 60fps will consume close to 1GB of your storage. I can game for around 4-4.5 hours when the phone is fully charged. There is no thermal throttling and phone's performance does not drop at all. Besides, the notchless screen improves.yoir gaming experience and haptic feedback is excellent too. If you're looking for an amazing gaming performance as a bonus, this is the phone for you. The frame rate is even more consistent than ROG phone 2, second maybe only to iPhones.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Honest Review for One Plus 7 Pro :It's my first one plus phone(12GB RAM, 256GB ROM) which I bought 4 months back and I am quite happy with the design and performance of it. I will try to cover most of the positive and negative aspects of the phone.Pros :1. Speed - I have used mobile phone of every company and I must say it has the best performance ever. Apps opened in just fraction of seconds.2. Display - It has been a wonderful experience of using 90 hertz display which makes it more superior than other mobile phone displays.3. Camera - Stability of the camera is very good even you are recording video in moving vechicle.4. Notchless display - One of the coolest feature of this phone is it's full screen display without any notch which gives user an amazing experience.5. Battery - Currently, this phone has a battery back up of one and a half day. Will update it after completing 1 year.6. Fast Charging - It will take your phone to get full charge from 0 to 100 percent in just 1 hour 20 minutes. And in half an hour, it will charge your phone above 50 percent.Cons :1. Quite Heavy - As I have used number of phones I personally find it quite heavy which is due to hardware they have provided. But now I am habitual to it.2. Auto Brightness - Sometimes I feel the auto brightness feature doesn't works well. So in that case I have to manually adjust the brightness. May be oneplus can fix this issue in the upcoming software updates.3. Night mode in camera - Night mode of the camera is not that good as compared to other phones. It could be more better. May be this can also be fixed in next software update.4. Price - Upto OnePlus 6T the price of the phones were nearly 35k. This is the first phone which costs nearly 50k. Quite overpriced but value for money.5. No IP rating - Although company claims that it is water resistant but ip rating must be given by company for such a flagship phone.6. Glass panel - The phone is very slippery if you are using it without cover and back panel can easily break. Therefore, I suggest to have a good case to protect.7. No 3.5 mm jack - You have to compromise with the 3.5 mm audio jack if you want to purchase this phone. I sometimes feel there must be 3.5mm jack but then I use bluetooth earphones.To sum up, although there are number of disadvantages but still this phone is value for money. I hope this review will be helpful.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Good points:1) quality feels premium while holding it in hand2) Superb sound quality and clarity3) Awesome display to look at4) Warp charging is much more faster than Dash charging  + battery retention time is average5) 90Hz barely makes a difference as compared to OnePlus 3 I used before this. But yes, Its indeed much more refined and smooth(still doesn't justify the price tag)Bad Points:1) The camera although takes awesome pictures, but it does get blurred while zooming and viewing the pic from gallery2) The pop up mechanism makes mechanical sound while switching on/off. At this price, it bothered me. It could have been seamless.3) Bit heavy and huge. Gives a feeling of nervousness while holding it without any case(as its made of glass body)4) front camera is average. Similar to OnePlus 5T I would say(not much difference)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Never purchase from amazon, mostly products are defective and mostly there is no refund/exchange also. Instead purchase from one plus store. Be cautioud, i'm the victim, i don't others to be.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Bought this device a month ago and during first couple of days the phone was overheating while charging. Within a few days, one plus rolled out an update and after that the issue was resolved. Speaking about the pros I would say the phone justifies its price. The look and feel of the phone is truly elegant and no words for its sleekness. Some people may find it a bit bigger, but when you are in love with tech and ready to shell out 50k on a phone, these issues are negligible.Secondly, the display is sheer beauty. It's crisp and bright, and the difference is visible!I don't use the phone like a maniac, hence I get a full day backup on a single charge. And even if you are a heavy user, still a 15 minute charge is more than enough to keep you going for next couple of hours.The sound quality is also very good, thanks to Dolby Atmos.RAM management doesn't need any discussion. One plus phones are already prominent for their RAM management.Camera quality was initially on the lower side, but one plus has rolled out an update for that and, since, the camera quality has improved a lot.Lastly, the bigger screen paves way for a comfortable gaming experience.And now about the cons:The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow than the physical scanner, but the AI will get used to your fingerprints and overtime it will automatically improve. (Faced this issue was initially, but now it is quick as a Ferrari)Absence of headphone jack means shelling out extra cash for wireless headphones.No LED notification light. You have to check your phone so as to ensure you have not missed out on something.I am not a professional reviewer but I have tried my best to include my overall experience with the phone.Conclusion: One plus has, no doubt, used 'cream of the crop' ingredients to make this beautiful piece of tech. I don't have any regrets for upgrading from OnePlus 6. After all, you have to loose certain things to gain a better one!Peace.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Overall nice phone.I bought it because I wanted a notch less and fully bazelless phone so I am happy with it though it slightly big.I personally recommend OnePlus 7 because of these reasons:-1. You can save 20 thousand rupees for same features.2. Size of the phone is more suitable and handy. OnePlus 7 pro has awkward and uncomfortable size.3. Its too heavy your wrist starts to fall when continuous usage.4.Pop up camera seems good but not reliable for long run.5. Warp charging is just a hype It takes more than 2 hours to fully charge.Some good things because of them I bought it.1. Best display with 90 Hz frame rate.2. Curved display.3. No notch.4. So basically I gave 20 thousand more for the sake of better or say best display in market right now.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The display is amazing and it just grows on you. You can never use any other handset after using this display.Battery is good for 1 and half day usage but the wrap charge is dope.Weight is a bit heavy and big screen but big phones are the call of the day so can't complain much.Design is so attractive and feels can never be backdated even after using this for 2 years.Camera specs are awesome and software is good bit with time it will improve more I am sure. Don't get me wrong it gets decent pictures and great selfies.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  OnePlus 7 Pro is a mammoth.The closest competition - the dilemma was should I go for the pro and pay 53k or the standard version and be done within 35k or so. Both have the same heart and soul. However, a waterdrop camera is a weird prospect. That, and only that made me choose the Pro. But when I got the Pro, I realised that the screen that came with it was just fabulous. I have never seen something like this and I will not see this in any other phone this year.The real flagship - Now that I am ready to shell 53k, it made sense to rather weigh the alternatives. S10 is the obvious answer but that punch hole is a turnoff for me. And again of all the features that S10 has that the OnePlus 7 Pro lacks, headphone jack is the only one I miss. Oh, and did I tell you about the screen on the Pro.... It's gorgeous!The backroom - I have always believed that a product is a reflection of how the company thinks. Behind every great product is a group with high standard of ethics, skills and the never settle attitude. Beside Apple, I have found that in this time (June 2019) companies like OnePlus and Honor (Huawei) are frontrunners in their products as well as their vision. So go for their products. Honor does have better camera.The new OnePlus 7 Pro lacks in camera. It's the only area it lacks in. But I see promise in the brand and future updates will make it better. I believe it. The battery drains faster when you play video games or watch videos. I found my screen on time to be close to 5.5 hrs with 16% battery remaining. 20% of the time was spent on PUBG, 15% on Google Play services and a combined 20%+ on videos. I found it quite underwhelming. However, once you take a break from your phone and go for lunch or a bath, you will be surprised to see how fact it charges. 0-100 in an hour. In fact plug it in for 15mins and you will see a 30% increase in charge.Everything else works like a charm. The fingerprint sensor is great. The first few times will be erratic but then it gets accustomed to the user. Works fine from there.The sound quality is almost great. It is loud but I wished that it was a tad bit better.The Oxygen OS is doing its job as we speak. It is so natural that you might not just feel that it's not stock Android. It's very close it the stock. And it's nothing extravagant. Oxygen OS is just right...Overall, rating hereBuild 9/10 just for the lack of official IP rating.Camera 7/10 I have taken better pics from phones that cost half. Pop up camera is good.Display 10/10 can't explain why. You need to see for yourself.Charging 9/10 This thing is a monster with Warp charger. And I don't need the wireless charging.Processor 9/10 Blazing fast. Took away a point because there is always room for improvement.Value for money 8/10 the phone is great but the camera could be better. As a user, I am very satisfied. I would rather hold OnePlus 7 Pro than the Samsung S10+.Nominating the Pro for the best smartphone of 2019.Enjoy your shopping!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It's okay okay Phone nothing so much extra ordinary about op7pro in 50 k plus budget. For me i have used Lg v30 plus . I find v30 plus had better features and technologies than this one. V30 plus comes with Wireless charging  ,IP68 rating, quadack headphone jack. In 4gb ram it runs fine i have played PUBG in it for year long and never ever it said restarted . I found divice is beat underrated. If you are planning for same features go for it. Now LG v30 plus comes in 25 k . May be you can plan buy LG V40 plus in latest in OP7PRO budget with better features .Phone start working on itself.Finger sensor works only if you press rightly and tightly fingerprint sensor sucks compare to other flagship phone I will not recommend OP7 Pro.Wasted 50k.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Seriously i bought this phone because i thought one plus is a true premium phone and one plus 7 pro would be a new flagship killer. Its been 2 weeks i have been this phone and started having problem with this.After the os update which one plus suggested 2 days back i have started having problems with this phone.During voice call other person voice is not clear always.Screen started hanging and many such small problems.Being such a premium smart phone manufacturer company i did not expect this issues from one plus.They always talk about the specifications and features but not about efficiency and reliability.Why such issues after every update.And i can not even see any difference after os update and update affected my phone's primary features.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  1. ScreenOMG. Use this Hulk once and you see all the other devices as tiny toddlers. Screen is the next Generation feature and it's absolute delight to watch youtube on this.2. Oxygen OSConfigurable. Sleek. Ease of use. It's addictive3. Top notch configWeather it's 12 GB RAM, 256 GB ROM or 30 htz Warm charging. It's top notch industry leading configuration. What more you will ask for?No wireless charging. No IP certification. Not required and no body cares.OnePlus becomes a market leader with this dream phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is my personal experience I am sharing. After 10days of purchase,  the phone got hanged during call, and the system didn't work for half an hour,not even power and reboot button. The problem recurred after 1 week.  After investing this big amount for a phone,  this kind of experience really gets you into trouble.Also,  would advice Amazon to extend return timeline and should give 1 month for these kind of products, as these are big investment for the user.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Works like charm..... #oneplus Never makes their customer down...... But shows lill bit of sadism in releasing colours.... Overall im very satisfied wid CAMERA:- not soo wide angled but its great nd no additional things added jst like oneplus 6 nd 6 and front popup camera works fine and crystal clear images can be takenBATTERY:-works great whole day and heres a tip use fhd+ and 60hz refresh rate for better battery backup when u needy.....PERFORMANCE:- ONEPLUS never settles as it says..... Even i use 6gb ram not even small lag detectedStereo speakers and dolby atmos... Even there is no overhead speakers they managed well to cover it... Wat ever its a small defect but it works wellOverall it's great product from oneplus and  #NEVERSETTLE\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Worst camera quality...... I thought I m getting the best phone but it's the worst one.... Plz do go for this mobile. With the amount of hype they made in media it's just a wastage of money. This is not a trusted brand to go for. Even I don't like to one star rest of the phone in the market will give the best phone with lots of features like vivo, oppo or Samsung. I raised a compliant with the tech team and will take it media for cheating us. I suggest all who are having the same problem take this to media in all forum, so that this company oneplus will understand and will do the needful. If not we have lots of ways to make them understand and return our money.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've been an iPhone user for more than a decade and this is my secondary phone. I'm writing this review after having used the One plus 7 pro for over 2 months. This is possibly the best overall phone available in the market if the price is taken into consideration.Pro:Good camera for recreational use. (Not for photography enthusiasts).One of the best refresh rates. Makes the entire experience of using the phone seamless.The screen quality is amazing.The phone feels well built and almost premium quality.No NOTCHThe OS is one of the best I've used. Closer to the original android.Curved screen and 90 GHz refresh rate make it the best phone around for video viewing.Unbelievably Fast ChargingCons:The camera is not at the level of other flagships. It tends to correct photographs too much. If you're looking to click accurate pictures its not the best one out there.The phone is quite heavy.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  1.) CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD BUT VIDEO RECORDING CONTINUES NOT WORKING PROPERLY WITHIN 25 SECOND RECORDING ONLY.2.) MOVIE SEE IN MOBILE NOT PROPERLY BECAUSE MOBILE SCREEN AGAIN AND AGAIN SMALL SCREEN DIVERT.3.) MOBILE TOUCH WORKING MISSING.4.) YOUTUBE SHOW WIRELESS HEADPHONE AND 2 EXTRA COVER WITH PHONE BUT NOT RECEIVED WITHTHIS PHONE.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I brought it 5 days ago and lots of thinking between S10 then gone for this one. Sinse last 6 years I am using Samsung S series and still have my S8 as my secondary backup phone. No doubt the phone is good, fast, speedy, great display. I am not regret as its best value for money when hardware, performance and price considered. All these below points are just I dont like, there are lots of other things which I like as well.1. The phone is heavy and big. 207gram feels like a brick. If you fill-up a phone with features but still form factor is not practical use then this is a fail. UFS 3.0 storage only have write speed of 229MB/S, this is lower than some phones with UFS2.1 example: S10. The phone design is common and looks just like other Mi, Vivo Oppo phones. No X factor. In my view its a premium Chinese phone.2. Camera is a myth. Sony IMX586 is a failed and over hiped sensor in its era. Now a days used in mid range Chinese phones. I wish OnePlus should have skipped this one. If camera in a phone is your primary requirement then keep away from this. I love photography and have my DSLR for that so I dont trust any phone camera or that was not a concern for me. I have tested in all conditions and sorry to say this is a bad camera for a flagship. Front camera is good enough and I like it including its design. I recommed that please turn of scene recognition, auto HDR in camera settings menu to click at least some good pictures in day light. For night or dark light camara is good I believe. I assumed that the developer team put their entire efforts to bring a camera which can provide good photos in night and forget that we take most of the photos in day light. So those night calibrated auto settings will ruin your daylight photos. But still even if you try to get best shots, its far behind Apple and Samsung Cameras.3. Oxygen OS is good and fast I am using 1st time, but it doesn't have native apps like Email Client, Music Player, Payment App, Security App, Calendar, Contact, Phone Call and so many others. For all these it's depending on stock Android. Now you say whats a big deal? Apps are available in playstore for free to download. But I think those free application are comes with lots of advertisements, notification and even Google native apps track you for their add selling. I use yahoo mail, why I will pay yahoo 350 rupees monthly to use their email client. Another thing I noticed that Home bar doesn't auto hide during keyboard popup so I accidentally click the home key many times during type and suddenly go to home screen. That is a big drawback. The home bar should be hide during type. OnePlus please look that simple but very useful stuff.Rest assured, I also agree with others that its an insanely fast phone. Battery is best in class as per my use. This is a good phone and would be best if Oneplus taken care of some useful requirements. A great Display and good hardware will not certify a phone as a flagship. There are lots of other aspects need to be considered. This phone doesn't fulfilled my criteria of a flagship however personal choices may be different by individuals.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is my first phone in the premium category and I'm glad I went ahead with investing those extra 20000 rupees for a phone. 12 GB of RAM will look after every thing that you can ever ask of a phone. I had no idea of what difference a screen of 90Hz refresh rate or 60Hz meant. But after using this phone and having seen my friend's 6T I can say that a 90 Hz screen is so buttery smooth that it spoils you. Fingerprint scanner has gotten better with every touch. Battery performance isn't too great but it does charge lighting quick. The curved screen and the Fluid Amoled Display just packs that final punch.It's not always we think of going for a 50k+ phone and if you're thinking of upgrading your phone and have the budget, go for OP7Pro without any apprehensions.Edit: I'm no pro photograper but the camera seems to be better with additional features after the Android 10 update.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Good phone. - Review after usage for a week.Best Full screen display i have used till now. Soo smooth(90hz refresh rate is a killer one).Camera is pretty good than the other mid-range phones (15 to 25k).Battery performance is nice. got full day(morning 9am to night 11pm) battery with single charge. (Since it is a new phone im spending more time with it, still battery is preforming nicely. im getting up to 7 hrs for screen usage time, with regular usage of whatsapp, instagram, facebook, insthorts, camera, photos, google news, Pubg(2 rounds), youtube (up to 30 mins), phones call of upto 20 mins) - Refresh rate - 90hz.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's a beast.Exceeding all your expectations.Worth every penny.Jus hooe you may secure the phone.There's a pre installed screen guard tepered glass.Such a goot battery backup with the best charging speed.I recoreded on my watvh it have 38 mins for full charge frome 20%Camera is just worth it better than googlepixel just a bit down in protrait.Only drawback is you don't get earphones. Which OnePlus should have given in this pricerange.Hiving 5 stars on the basis of using ohone for 3 days.Worth it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This was a great deal offered by Amazon. The phone quality is top notch. 90hz screen refresh rate gives a buttery smooth experience while using the apps which support it. In-display fingerprint reader is relatively fast and accurate. Haptics is improved and precise but not as good as iPhone which is a lot more expensive.Battery life is not awesome but decent as it drains out faster when the phone is used heavily while playing games. Although the warp charging does really help out here. The phone charges upto 50% in under 20 mins. This 50% lasts quite a while when used judiciously.Camera quality is decent again. Photos come out crystal clear and sharp in good lighting. Night photos are not very clear and have a lot of grain. Inbuilt night mode provides a brighter image but still there's grain visible in the photos. Selfie camera is also good. There is the motor noise when the selfie camera pops up and down. I dont recommend using the pop up camera for unlocking the phone.Considering the price, I would recommend this phone to anyone with this budget. This is 2019's best phone afterall.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This phone is awesome, but I can't really use my headphones right now because I didn't get a 3.5mm to USB Type C cable. I tried buying it on the OnePlus official website but it is out of stock.The 90Hz refresh rate and everything else about this phone is fantastic.I bought the 12GB variant and I guess it is completely worth, since it gives a tough competition to premium flagships of Samsung and Apple.I play a lot of video games and I find this phone perfect for a person like me.While playing heavy-duty games like PUBG or Fortnite, the battery drains a bit fast but you can charge it from 0-100 in an hour.The screen is really huge, and because of its features I guess the phone weighs a bit more than other phones do.I would definitely recommend buying this phone to my friends or colleagues.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is my biggest mistake to buy Chinese Mobile phone.In future I will avoid to buy any Item which is belong to China as China has attacked on my nation and my countrymen and brave soldiers are martyred for the pride of my nation.I would request Amazon to avoid selling of chinese product in India to respect our National emotions.Request to all other Indians not to Buy Chinese Products.Nothing is important than National Pride.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The phone is absolutely FANTASTIC! Works like a charm. The best thing is the display! Nothing comes close to this!A few cons I noticed are:1. The phone is kinda long from the usual ones.2. It's heavy (especially since I jumped from Oneplus 3 - 150g to oneplus 7 pro - 200g)4. The case that comes with this is slippery so better to buy a new one. I'm looking for one now too.5. The battery seems to go down a little faster to my liking with the 90Hz on. I haven't tried 60Hz yet thanks to the WARP charger.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Just one word . Amazing.  The speed is terrific and the response from the insane machine is mind boggling . It switches from tab to tab like lightning . Front camera is a pop but have no fear.  It's well designed and has fall prevention sensor . Phone doesn't have headphones slot and hence need to use wireless . Sound and video clarity is beautiful . I would suggest this phone to people like me who still believes in Android and for the love of Goodies it offers .\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am very happy with the product. But what's the meaning of phone without headphone jack or connector. If we are buying the phone of 50000, the company cant even provide us the connector for earphone? I would suggest not to go for this phone until and unless they have a solution for this. Before buying this phone just think why didn't they provide Type C earphone or connector. If we are spending more than 30K on any phone. We expect all accessories for the same.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It is my costliest ever phone and while reading couple of reviews, I was a bit sceptical on ordering.But finally ordered and a big surprise. I live in tier 3 city and the phone was scheduled to be delivered the very next day. Such super fast delivery has never been heard. I was able to reschedule the delivery date easily on chat with customer care executive. Excellent.. Pros .1. Outstanding display. The quality of the display can not be told in words . It has to be experienced to feel.2. Camera quality. The default 12MP pics are sharp and feel life like. The 48MP in Pro mode is somey out of this world.3. Battery. The 4000 mAh battery is more than enough for a normal user ever at QHD and 90 refresh rate. If you need to last longer, just reduce the screen resolution. The battery was 67% when I received the phone. Even after 1 system update install, 20 app updates from playstore, and setting up the entire phone, the battery stands at 31% after 17 hrs of starting the phone for first time. Great.4. Hardware. The SD855 is more than sufficient for most users while perfect suited for a heavy user.5. Warp charger supplied with phone.6. Thick transparent cover supplied and has cuts at right places which don't obstruct the moving front camera.Cons1. Pricey.2. The pre applied screen protector is good for nothing. It already had bubbles in it and within 6hrs of receiving, it had worked loose from all 4 corners. It won't last long and will surely peel off soon.3. Nothing supplied. At 53k, leave a wireless headphone, it doesn't ships with even a wired headphone.4. Packaging could've been better while shipping a 53k phone. Even a 200 Rs phone cover has better packing. No bubble wrap to prevent jerks and shocks. Just a Amazon branded cardboard and nothing else.Desired.1. Wish it had shipped with a wireless headphone.2. A pre applied 3d tempered glass for better protection.Update. All this is rubbish. The phone has developed a fine green line at the edge of display and within 4 months of purchase, the display nuas to be changed. And as always, service center terms this as physical damage and refuses to honor warranty.Never ever buying OnePlus. Even a phone worth 4000 doesn't has problems in 4 months.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Feels very premium to hold and the 90 hz refresh rate is just too good.. feel like its a bit over priced.. and for those who expected 2 cases and wireless earphones, its a special review package which is clearly told by the presenter.. there is no earphone or even 3.5 mm earphone adapter which should be bought from after market.. All the functions of the phone works like a breeze.. no issues so far.. overall its a good phone..\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The OnePlus 7 pro is a large phone at 6.7 inches. It is heavier than you'd expect and is a little difficult to use single handedly. The bezel less screen sometimes makes it hard to use gesture navigation. Besides this there is literally nothing to complain about. The phone is incredibly fast, the display is incredibly satisfying, the camera is great even if it isn't the absolute best, and the UI is brilliant.Recommend to anyone looking for a phone in this price range if one handed use is not a big concern.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I ordered my OnePlus 7 Pro with lot of doubts in mind specially it not being water resistant and camera quality in previous versions.I highly recommend the OnePlus 7pro and writing this review so it might help others .Pro-1) Screen - Best Screen so far on any phone and with 90Hz refresh rate it is best mobile to play games with . I love playing PUBG and Asphalt 9 on Top setting and Result are terrific.2) Portrait Mode - OnePlus has never been the Best Camera device in market but OnePlus7pro has one top notch portrait mode. You will love taking Portrait in this device.3) Speed - With Latest 855 Snapdragon , I never laid hands on such smooth Android device . I can directly compare smoothness to IphoneX on this device.4) Built Quality - OnePlus 7 Pro has very strong built quality which I found very impressive. I did checked out YouTube videos to found its durability and was impressed.5) OxygenOS: With OxygenOS the experience of Android is smooth as silk.Cons :Water Proof : Only reason to not buy this mammoth phone . I was planning Huawei P30 Pro but then we have water proof cases for that purpose.Fingerprint Sensor : It does seems temperamental at times .Headphones : No Headphone Provided with devices and No Headphone Jack . Seriously heavy disappointment.Wireless Charging : Wireless Charging is a show off feature. We all know it's very slow but it does look good to flaunt.Weight : If you don't prefer Heavy phones , let this go . ONEPLUS 7pro is 200 gms and definitely feels heavy . Though I found  myself attracted to heavy phones .Review : If Best camera is priority  and you do tend to take underwater photography seriously, Spend 20K Extra for Huawei P30 Pro.OnePlus 7pro has a great camera , it's 3x zoom and bokeh is awesome . And is a great device , if you are looking for Good Camera , Super Cool Build and Best Performance.Speed is what OnePlus were really always selling here. This time they really went Beyond Speed.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The phone is worth of money .I have seen on youtube they provide headphones and car dash charger with two extra cover.But i didn't get any of them totally disappointed with one plus team.If they are not giving such things then they should not show such things in their videos along with box .\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  One of the beast in this price rangeEven in mid 2020 this is the best choice for the price1. Oxygen OS is so fluid and blazing fast.2. No lags at all and butterly smooth.3. Aggressive RAM Management4. Display is outstanding, Colors are best , Viewing angles are great.5. Processor is Blazing fast.6. Battery is Amazing Screen on time is almost about of 6 hrs with 1.5 hr gaming , Switching between mobile data and wifi , Streaming OTT , Watching YouTube .7. very well optimised software.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  PRO's1.Display- Stunning it is the Best Display Today2.Design and Build Quality- It will blow u out3.Perforamce- The Fastest Android Phone no need to say Snap 855 with Oxygen OS Deadly Combination Absolutely Beast4.Camera- It is the Only department Where it is behind Pixel or Galaxy Note or Apple or Huawei Flagships Still it is not deal Breaker5.Audio-Stereo Speakers Damn Loud6.Vibration-Just Amazing Haptic feedback7.Connections-Call Quality brilliant Tested with Airtel and Idea networks8.Battery- Will get uu 1 day mostly and Warp Charging it will take 0-100 percent for about 80 mins initial 80% will be charged in 50 mins but last 20% takes 30 minsCON's-1.Biggest Con is No 3.5 headphone jack nor type C earphones in box2.No Wireless Charging not usefull though3.No official IP rating could have given by them4.Bit on a Expensive Side by OnePlus5.No Gorilla Glass 6 Which is Shocking\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have been using OP7 Pro for last 7 days and I found performance of the phone, camera, battery live up to OP expectations until 7th days.  I witnessed a song app is playing music even after I killed all the process. As last step, I restarted the phone and to my surprise phone got stuck at restart for a minute or so without doing anything. After couple of minutes, I see screen going blank and photo just died. It won't start whatever you do. I finally found that this is a happening to many OP7 Pro phones and way to recover is pressing Power and Volume up key.Overall very disappointed . This has made me think if we should even trust and buy any more OP phone at all.I also found that once you purchase a phone through Amazon, it is not easy to return a defective phone. Even if you are still within 10 day return window, you cannot just ask for a replacement for defective phone. You have to spend good amount of time with Amazon customer service who will get a technician to visit you and find all ways not to accept the return which is very disappointing.So, firstly it is good to avoid this model till OP fixes this issue. If you still want to buy it, better buy it from retain stores and not online because you will be stuck with this product even if you don't want to.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is my personal review after 2 days of usage and one thing is for sure , that this is the BEST DISPLAY ever, just like said at the event \"FAST AND SMOOTH\". Watching series/movies is a pleasing experience and hands on to One plus for that.The performance is smooth and amazingly fast as always with OP. They are Masters in this segment.I saw many comments on social media regarding the average battery backup, yes it is true but with WARP CHARGING it doesn\\'t really matters. It is more than a balance to me. I won\\'t mind burning more battery for a smoother experience which is new and missing with other brands.The biggest drawback I felt is the Camera. The pop up camera has got too much crop and if you open the video then you might end up shooting yourself only. The Rear camera too needs some optimisation which I am sure we will see soon.One thing which I want to bring in notice is the \"NIGHTSCAPE\" mode in Rear camera, it was working good before the first update and as soon I updated it , the quality went down. Same is with the normal one as well.One thing I felt which should have been given is the Type-C to 3.5mm jack cable, that was indeed missing. Rest everything is just perfect.Overall I will give it \"4 stars out of 5\". Deducted one because of the camera, was expecting a better one with OP7 pro atleast. I am optimistic that OP will come up with a strong solution soon. üññüññ\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is my first One Plus phone hence I don't  have a baseline to judge against.Pros:1. Excellent camera quality.2. It's a beauty to look at( P.S: I bought the Nebulae Blue).3. Display is just superb.(The resolution even when set to FHD+ and refresh rate of 60Hz is class leading).4. Snapdragon 855 is the fastest Qualcomm processor as of now so no knit picking in the speed and performance aspect.5. Price is perfect for all that you are getting.6. Selfie cam is better than I expected.Cons:1. The wide angle camera is a huge let down.(I have tried the S10+ wide angle lens setup and it's not comparable with this lens).2. No USB type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter.( Another huge let down if you are used to getting earphones out of the box.)3. The QHD+ and 90Hz refresh rate drains charge fast and it's pretty obvious.4. At least a splash proof body could have been given at this price ( This is because splash proof displays and IP rated Samsung phones start around the 10 - 20K price range).\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Almost a week of use now and I'm loving it from every aspect. It's a flagship phone at a much lesser price than the other brands. Camera quality is superb and even night mode is great (only on the primary cam though, night mode doesn't work well in zoom/tele). It looks stunning, performance is superb and battery life is great even for a heavy user.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Better than Samsung M30,A30,A50,A70,mi note 7pro, poco f1, vivo v15, oppo f11 pro, one plus 6t and all other middle(under INR 30000).Also better than iPhone 7, 7plus, 8, 8 plus, xr and upper middle priced phone(up to INR 60000).Also ignore all other brand phones.Points:1. Camera is excellent, night mode is brilliant2. No lagging at all3. No heating issue4. Comes with warp charger in box, super fast charging5. Front screen is the curved and totally premium look. 6.67in Fluid Amoled Display (2340 x 1440 pixels, HDR10+).6. No bending issue. Solid body.7. Sceen is not bleeding. No problem at all.8. Android pie (v9) with one of the most lightest skin Oxygen OS 9.5.3GM21AA (lots of customizations possible)9. No network issue (mobile network, wifi, screen casting)10. Little bit Slippery back side due to glass body. You can buy back cover for that. Also Silicon cover is come within box, if you like it.11. Popup camera is automatically lowered during free fall. ie. If you are using your phone with front camera poped up, and accidentally you drop you phone, front camera will be automatically goes back inside.12. No bloatwares (only Google apps(can not uninstal), one plus' 3-4apps(some of them can be uninstall) and Netflix(can not uninstall) are pre-Installed.I bought one plus 1 back in 2014. After that no phone attract me to buy it. But finally made my mind to buy this phone. And so far, no regrets at all.Jumping 6 generation(from one plus 1 to one plus 7pro) is fun.Hope you also like this phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I bought this phone only for snapdragon 855 processor and all new 90hz display. I am satisfied with the display and the performance it provides. I don't use camera of any phone so my review will not tell about camera. But as I've seen with this phone camera quality is little bit average I'll say. This phone have some serious issues about the weight balance and absence of 3.5mm jack (adapter is not available also inbox ofcourse they want customers to spend valuable money on there brand). And non availability of 3.5mm adapter on official site is also a problem. Stereo speakers are also soo average.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have been using this for quite few months and first look is very impressive. The curved edge to edge display gives very premium feel. Here is how it goes for performance-1. Display is bright and no problem in reading even in outdoors. Scratch resistance is impressive. I am not using any tempered glass or screenguard and I don't find any scratches till now.2. Battery is impressive and quick charge is really quick about 40-45 mins for full charge.3. Processor is best, no lag ,no hanging and no heating isuues even with heavy use.4. Audio is decently loud and clear.5. Camera is the best part of this phone. Back and front both cameras give awesome clear pictures. I will try to add few samples here and you can judge by yourself.6. Just one issue with fingerprint sensor in display and I found that on screen sensor is not as sensitive as sensors on back.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Review after 6months:Not preferable,1. when try to put face unlock that will the most weird thing you'll see, coz the cam should pop out and detect you and which will take time to complete this process.2. Major drawback is NFC(tap & pay) is disabled/not working, why would you put more money when this are not working?3. Lots and lots of bugs like when you swipe for menu most of the times you will observe the apps invisible.4. Phone gets heated alot and lot when you play pubg/games.5. As per the company this phone should hardly get warmer when you use for a long time, but the AMOLED this is pure nonsense.6. You'd feel it very slippery without having a cover.7. Battery backup is not that great, it will make you to charge twice in a day.8. Accessories are touching sky with their price.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have bought this phone 10 days back. While the phone was in my pocket with some keys the back panel got cracked .Poor plastic quality is being used. And for the repairs if you will go to their so called EXCLUSIVE service centres you'll hardly find air to breathe. They just have 1 repair engineer who looks after all the devices .If you are spending half a lac rupees on such a gadget then it just feel as if I have thrown my money in the garbage.They dont have adequate staff to manage their repairs even.Finally i have spent another 4k on getting the new back panel which they are again claiming can break any time.GREAT SERVICE HATSS OFF!!!DONT BUY!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Just an amazing phone... I upgraded from Redmi Y2 and trust me guys...if you are upgrading from some 10-15k phone to this one... you'll surely love this device. The display is the best thing here, 90Hz refresh rate makes it so smooth to swipe... The phone no doubt is blazing fast..no lags or whatever seen till now. Some people were complaining about Ghost Touch or Pop up camera coming out while calling, we'll I haven't seen anything like that till now. These issues are present only on a very small no. of devices, so most probably you won't get a defective one...Warp charging is brilliant. Overall I think you should go for it. Don't see those camera reviews and all....OnePlus is improving them constantly...even I got a camera improvement update too...Soo I think it's the perfect phone under 50k\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is beautiful gem. I ordered it even after knowing of all the issues people are facing on it, I was little afraid but thank God I am not facing any such issues, no ghost touch, no battery drain etc. Camera might not be good for people who regularly use high end devices, but it's not bad. The overall experience is just amazing be it sound from speakers, the beautiful display and the smoothness of OS' transition animations, and ofcourse the new haptic feedback motor is amazing, it makes the overall experience even better. If you have money to spend, don't hesitate and go for it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  There is a black spot on the screen. First i thought it is a dust particle under the screen protector. But after i removed the protector after 2 weeks, i knew the pixels are not working. I cannot attach screen shot because it wont show up on it since its the hardware problem. It is really annoying. I am not getting any help too. Worst mobile and service. PLEASE DO NOT BUY ONEPLUS.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  \\xa0I know this time people might feel this mobile is over priced by oneplus, but the features this mobile has, other companies like samsung or huawei might have priced it over 80k.Fingerprint reader is definitely faster that the 1st gen used in oneplus 6t. It is much quicker now.And quick pay is nor quich launch and we can set a no. of apps from which we can choose what to open which long pressing fingerprint rrader which unlocking and swiping to select app after unlock like paytm scan, phonepe scan etcCamera is another plus.The quality is great and telephoto is cool but needs improvement thought which is easily possible via software updates.Battery life what is get is arount 6 or 6 and a half hrs screen on time with quad hd resolution with 90hz. Yes both this settings will take a lot of battery but 6 6 and a half hrs for this setting is not bad. If we turn doen to 60 hz we might net few extra hrs but believe me one you are in 90hz it doesn't feel like going back to that laggy experienceOverall a totally worth mobile for the pricetag given by oneplus is is still a lot cheaper that what other companis might have offered.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Not value for money .

On comparing specs in gsmarena with 7 pro and 7t pro , it's observed , 8 series is wayblow in specs. I suppose the high rate is because of its IP rating .To the product review it's simply the best feel you have while using this. Cameras offer crisp and natural colours, sensons are too good. Fingerprint response , gesture controls are well justified.I definitely recommend this if you are buying a phone for min 3 years use.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Super display quality, great touch feel,best in camera phone, battery life is ok,rest super mobile overall .But theres only one big caution the discount which Amazon mentioned in terms of (no cost EMI discount) is totally rubbish the cost of mobile is 50999/- we have to pay to them if we choose 6months EMI option we have to pay 8499.93√ó6=50999.58.Then why mentioned no cost EMI discount and all  it shows the value of one plus 7pro is RS 48979.64 in order summary.who will give this discount of RS 2019,Which Amazon mentioned in order summary.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Oh my God awesome product!The screen is freaking smooth and nice build quality.

Speed has always been the forte of One plus and Kudos to the team you wont even find one slightest of a glitch while using this device. Allso dont worry if you hate waiting for long hours to get your battery charged, the new 30W Warp charger does its job for you in no time. The camera quality is also decent and fulfills all your daily requirements. Overall the experience has been very good and trust me you wont be regretting your purchase, So if you are planning of buying one simply go for it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The display is just too good. I was unsure about the battery life because of mkbhd. But in my use I'm getting around 7 hours of SOT with 90hz and 2k resolution.Post camera update, the hdr issues have been almost solved.In my opinion the higher price is worth it, the other flagships at least in India are way too overpriced\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  *Fingerprint Reader : Very fast and excellent*Camera : Nightscape shines the brightest, overall camera quality has improved drastically with recent updates*Battery life : More than enough for a day of heavy to moderate usage*Os : Oxygen Os with Android 10 gives excellent user-friendly performance*Display : 90hz packed with QHD display gives amazing visual and ultra smooth touch experience**With MKBHD\\'s \"Phone of the year Award\" Overall  performance of this phone is excellent and one should definitely go for it for complete user-friendly and buttery smooth experience **\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Writing review after exact one month of usage.Pros:1. 90hz display: Full screen 90hz display will make you want to go back to your phone again and again. It's smooth, it's amazing in a layman's term. If you're a gamer, prefer watching movies on your phone you'll definitely love it.2. Camera: Camera quality is superb and I personally feel is at par with iPhone XI and outdoes iPhone in several conditions3. Battery: It offers a superb battery back-up lasting whole day without heavy usage. Even with the heavy usage the battery drain is quite slowCons: None so far.I know One Plus 8 is around the corner but if you're a fan of full screen display then One Plus 7 Pro is a go to phone, because speculations are rife that One Plus 8 will feature a punch hole display which I personally feel is a step back.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  An amazing phone with everything you need.It provides an ultimate user experience with 90hz display everything is so smooth never experienced lag yet.Fingerprint reader is fast but 1 in 10 times it might not recognize your fingerprint and that's okay one can settle with that.It is much better than the gaming phones out there with fnatic mode and the display it is just perfect.The camera was good with some minor issues when i received the phone but after the update the camera experience has been alot better.It provides me a screen on time of around 5-6 hours  which is quite good because i am a heavy user.*All in all this phone justifies it's pricing*\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I read more reviews on this phone and saw many videos of reviews and tech experts many of them say that it's the best phone in Android. As they mentioned seriously it's the really the best phone. Best features. I took 8gb ram 7 pro.1. Display, 2. Touch, 3. Camera, 4. Speed, 5. Design, 6. Battery life, 7. Fast charge.Drawbacks1. No headset jack.2. Portrait mode is only for limited distance.3. Memory card slot.As it is the premium phone and paying 53k we expect basic things like headset jack or the headset. But didn't even give the music jack connector.All the premium phones have wireless features but we miss in this phone. Hope it comes in next version.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I bought a oneplus 7pro and i was happy but oneplus doesnt provide type c to 3.5 mm jack.. i have managed by not having audio jack in phone but why didnt u give the connector in the box content.. I was vry disappointed with oneplus... I have paid 49k for a phone and i didnt get a type c to 3.5 mm jack connector!! This is vry disappointing..\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Everything is great about the phone except for a few things.1. Due to curved edged screen, touching at undesired points becomes eminent, which leads to opening apps randomly which I don't want to.2. Adobe Acrobat Reader Pro gets stuck if the file size is beyond 2 MB, even with 8 MB RAM!3. Screen guard which comes with the phone by default, is of quite poor quality. Mine got worn and torn within first 3 weeks.But apart from the above, the phone's performance, battery, camera, sound, speed - everything is just great! Despite the minor flaws, I am loving this one!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Ok first let me tell you something. All the negative reviews are before the OTA update. So if you are wondering whether to buy it or not, don't think again. This mobile is a beast.Pro'sTop class displayNo notchesVery Good battery. Getting 7.5 hrs SOT with 90hz+ QHDStereo Speakerssplash resistantOxygen OS (I am sure it will go till Android 12)Super fast indisplay Finger print scannerCon'sNo headphone jack. Not even converter provided. I thought there will be one.Pretty Okish Camera. Hoping for some good OTA updates.No LED notification lightFinally Camera to Api is enabled. So install Gcam and it will do wonders.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  If there's one thing that caught my eye when my colleague bought this phone is the display. It was a stunning 2k+ Quad HD display after all. It then lead me to look for video reviews from the youtube experts. It turns out, they did appreciate the display and phone. It's amongst the best displays on a phone in recent times and it's a Samsung panel.Pros of this phone:1. Ultra smooth beautiful quad hd screen with a 90 Hertz display. It is 6.67 inches in size including the curved edges. It's great for social media,videos which can render in 1440p if available and for reading too. It also does not have a notch and you pretty much love it.2. Battery life with a 4000 MAH battery is great when you consider that you use a 90 Hz refresh vivid qhd screen. Your could switch to 60 Hz but nah. :)3. Back cameras do a good job in capturing pics. An yet to really test them. The front 16 mp pop up camera works well. It's a good camera setup.4. It's got the SD 855 processor and it's butter smooth and fast.5. With the oxygen OS, it delivers near stock Android experience. It will very soon be upgraded to 10.6. Warp charging: it's got crazy fast charging compared to op6 which I have before this and 90% will get your through the day and more.7. The on screen finger print sensor is great to use.Cons:1. It's a heavy phone at 200 grams. You will take a week to get used to it since we all are so adaptive.2. It's got a curved display with curved edges. Accidental Ghost touches do occur from time to time. Also, your need to be careful. If you drop it face down, it will fall on the screen side given its weight and with the curved edges, there is a chance to break.3. With the launch of the OP7t, One plus has diluted the significance of this phone. We Indians are price conscious and the OP 7t costs 7k lower than each of the OP 7 pro models even after prices dropped on the 7 plus pro (OP 7 pro costs 4k lesser than when launched 6 months ago).Update: just found that there's a One Plus 7t Pro launching on October 10th 2019. With it, this will be definitely be the undisputed OP Flagship.4. For the price, no type C to 3.5 mm jack connector in the box, no type C ear phones, no wireless charge, no waterproof certification but you do get a case.Verdict:If you want the great screen, FHD+ 2K+ display, 90 Hz refresh and notch less design, go for the one plus pro. If you want most of what pro has, a balanced phone, some additional features and are ok with the 2k display and notch screen design, go for One plus 7t which is a super budget flagship killer too.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Very bad service of amazon there is no content service .There is a option to call but no one call me .Sepaker hv problem sometimes . Suddenly Stop working.Ppl Complan that thr is some eco or damage voice and n mic .Please help\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  So I changed from iOS to Android ,previously used iPhone 8 what a great phone it was no complaints coming to one plus 7pro at first I was apprehensive about this phone whether to buy or not after thinking a lot finally bought this one , I don't use camera that much so issues there , finger print scanner has small issues but it's okay , coming to screen larity it is the best . Over all it's a good phone for one year use .. rest is best ..\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was skeptical on whether to buy it or not but ended up buying it. I was not expecting much but it surprised me because of it's blazing fast speed and excellent performance. I recommend you guys to buy it. You will not be disappointed\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Phone is simply Superb. Camera, screen, speed, quality and look and feel.Only area of improvement is battery. But yeah, with this performance you won't be disappointed with buying a power bank for this phone.And Warp charging is soooooper fast.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  i face many problems and getting frustrated because of  many issue likealthough big ram but still it hangs . touch pad working automatically even after screen lock...the screen lock is not working and you can unlock with only one up swap...and automatically dailed numbers....\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Starting with the camera quality, the phone takes gorgeous pictures. Within three weeks, OnePlus has send more than three updates centered on the camera and it gets better and better. Photos are sharp, colors a bit vibrant but I love it, video quality is better than any phone. Portraits are somewhat average, but that is true for any smartphone. Selfies too are of very good quality, and support nightscape.In very low light (almost pitch black with a few lights in the distance) the phone performed better than my expectations but I rarely use it for such situations. In normal low light (clubs, dimly lit rooms) it performs very well. I have attached a lot of camera samples. The best part about the OnePlus 7 Pro is the sharp quad HD display and with the 90Hz display, you can't stop just scrolling through your phone because it's so smooth and addictive. Everything from 4k videos to just the wallpapers look mesmerizing on this phone. The chin of the phone is also almost non existent, like the iPhone X.The fingerprint reader is very fast but takes more than one try with wet hands.The battery lasted much longer than the reviews said, easily finishing one day (and more than one with moderate usage and the battery saver turned on).The performance is just mind-numbingly fast. I realised its importance while opening PayTm which would always open slowly on my previous phone. No lag whatsoever.OxygenOS is a big reason to consider this phone because it is much better than the OneUI or Oppo/Vivo's wierd UIs.The only complaint I have is that OnePlus did not include a headphone jack converter in the box and the official converter on their website is out of stock. I tried a few cheap converters but sound quality was very bad. This is a trick for me to buy their new Bluetooth earphones WHICH I WILL NOT.Anyway the speaker quality is very very rich and good with Dolby Atmos so I can manage till I buy a pair of other Bluetooth earphones.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I would like to thanks One plus for launching this amazing mobile..camera is awesome , beyond expectation.. especially the night mode.. battery back is good..touch screen is like butter...overall I will suggest this is best smart phone I have ever seen around me..I am sharing this after using around 15 days...\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Dislay-Great 90hz QHD+ AMOLED display5/5Camera- It is good but struggles in tricky situation especially in low light but still its 4/5 on camera department.UI - 1000000/5Sound- Loud and clear but bass is little off 4.5/5Battery- It hogs a lot of battery. You need to carry that WARP Charger around if you want to last a day if you watch a lot of YouTube/Netflix or play games. Otherwise for a typical user it would last a day 3/5.Charging Speed - 10/5\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  3 things :-1 Camera - Camera is like 15000 phone Ka Ho, Camera is not What i expected after spending so much..2 - Fingerprint - Sometime it irritates!!  im like Bhai Bhool Gya kya mujhe..3 - Not Feature rich like Samsung s10plusNow If you like Speed then Go for it, But Camera is where 1+ has to do Something & i m shocked that this phone doesn't have 960fps slowmo!!!  Thats why im saying 30000 is okay for this phone.. & Guys It is Heavy Brick so be prepared.. Charging is Really fast, Screen is Awesome, 855 Dragon is Does the job.. But still i wont suggest this phone unless u get it below 30000..Thank you\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I got my first OnePlus 7 pro after a week it's launched but the Pop up camera not working properly... so I requested Amazon and theyvsent someone for inspection. After that when this defect is confirmed, I got my mobile on 2 nd day.. Thanks Amazon for responding so fast.After one successful replacement I finally got my phone. One plus 7 pro is one of it's kind. No comparison..... Video quality and stability mind blowing.... Camera quality decent... Touchscreen works like charm.... U will understand after using it.... Screen - OMG! really appreciate this approach.After having blazing fast processor and amazing fluid amoled screen i am pretty impressed that it stays long enogh ... Almost 18 to 20 hours... I playbpubg, watching videos on YouTube and Amazon prime.... Though its give very decent battery life....After 1 month of full usage I can say proudly that I am satisfied with this product. A bit disappointed on OnePlus for not adding the type C to 3.5 mm jack. But overall its a mobile worth of 50k....\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  One major drawback is that you cannot make folders inside the apps screen. Whats the point in spending 60k when you cannot even organise your work. Everytime you go to apps screen , just try finding the app you are looking for. Also amazon just replaces and doesnt allows us to return the phone. Never buy in my recommendation.......go for samsung note 10 instead......\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Mobile is awesome, Its very handy, beautiful in hand, superb in speed and best camera used so far. If you look for some smart device in your hand, fastest speed and you like quality photography. Oneplus 7pro is the device.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The best phone ever...videos in YouTube wit 1080 so real it can go beyond that...camera amazing shots... about camera shots it has every single bit of clearity when u capture...just need to dig into the settings part...I'm in love love love love love with my one plus 7pro nebula colour..it's amazing... performance n everything lots to say...but this is the best ever phone for next future...catch me if u can settle hahaha...cos m settled already..\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  1 star for Amazon not to phoneDon't buy on NO COST EMI else you will regret on your decision.

I believe this no much difference with OnePlus 7T either. I wanted to return it but the policy won't let me do that, not impressed Amazon, I regret not reading Amazon return policy before buying.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The phone has disappointed me on various fronts. I have 8Gb and 256 Gb variants. Despite being the higher end of it's offering, it doesn't perform up to its standard. It hangs very often even while single-tasking. It's a shame on One Plus that even their camera doesn't respond while clicking the pictures. Their customer support is neither responsive not agile. They still are very parochial in their approach and it's better to go for some brand that listens to their customers.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was using 1plus 3T from last 2.5 years and I was satisfied with it. I was happy that I am upgrading my phone with 1plus 7pro which I have heard about a lot but my expectations were shattered when I used its camera. The camera quality is very poor as compared to what has been shown in the launch event. I am very disappointed with it as my main purpose to buy this phone is because of its camera. It's battery life is also just OK as I have to charge it on frequently basis\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Fastest Android mobile in market..it has its own flaws however the positives covers them up..Pros:1.

No 3.5 mm headphone jack or adapter3. Finger print reader works 9/10 times but with wet fringers you simply cannot login4.

This is the worst phone I have ever bought. Even though there are few good things such as display, camera but bat things out number good things. I have been facing many problems after 3 weeks of the purchase of phone.Problems I have been facing:1. My phone gets switched off when I recieve a call.  I have never heard this problem and never faced this  problem before. Also worst thing is I won't know who  called me after I switch on my phone.2. Battery life:  When I recieved this phone, I was very happy with the  battery life. But after 6 weeks of usage, I have been  facing issues wirh the battery. For 2 hours usage of  Netflix, the battery consumption increased to 25-28  percent from 18-20 percent.3. Lagging:  I always keep my system up to date with system  updates. But sometimes my phone lags as if it has been  used for 2 years.4. OnePlus customer service:  I have contacted OnePlus customer service several  times, but none were able to solve my issues.At first I was very happy while I was using my phone, but now all I do is worry when I use my phone.I hope OnePlus will solve my phone problems. I would be very happy if OnePlus acknowledges my message.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Full 5 ‚ú≥Ô∏è.. also my 1st Oneplus...Touch sensibility 5/5Gaming 5/5Camera 4.5/5 (cartoon type pictures)Vibrator engine 5/5Screen ratio 5/5Battery backup 4/5 . (For 90hz refresh rate more power consumption)U have the bucks. Go for it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  One plus is nothing more than a social media hype, the phone are generally coming with minor defects. I first ordered this and fingerprint reader came with defect after which I followed with amazon badly but got poor response. The phone was replaced in close to 7 days of time, the second phone also came with defect and it is heating up even over 45 degree while in normal usage and now it is a pain. Moreover amazon have very bad support on this. Polishing used on phone is also bad, after 10 days of normal usage scatches have appeared on phone not on glass back but on metal side of phone.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The screen size and viewing has just spoiled me.The bezeless screen with curved display is really to die for. I don't know if I can ever go back from this screen to any other device now.The processing speed is really really good.It doesn't slow down when it is dying in battery or if 4-5 apps are running in parallel. Processing is just flawless.When I was buying this phone, I was continuously told that camera is something u won't like. However, to my surprise till now the images taken are just amazing.Really love the portrait mode and wide angle feature on this. So amazing.Overall mobile feels really premium in your hands.Must recommended buy if this comes under your budget.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I bought it for my friendCamera AwesomePerformance MindblowingLook ShinyPrice Not ok with thatFingerprint Very responsiveBattery life upto 8hrsBest in class camera\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have been using this phone for almost 7months now, I upgraded from Nexus 6P and this is my first oneplus phone.The screen is excellent and it is the biggest USP of this phone. It is a breeze to use this phone, UI is uncluttered and minimalist.However, the worst part of this phone is FINGERPRINT SCANNER which ruins the entire experience of using the phone. They snapped on a half baked technology called optical fingerprint scanner, more than 50% time it doesn't work. I tried multiple times deleting and enrolling again, it did not improve. It is not that it doesn't work but it is unpredictable when it won't work. Imagine you try to unlock the phone using finger and it doesn't work on repeated attempts and you have to finally enter the PIN to unlock the phone. Imagine having this repeat 15-20 times a day !! All this with a clean thumb, if you got wee bit of dust or dirt on your finger, just forget it !!. For example, after you open your car door and get in, I can guarantee that the phone unlock wont work, a little bit of dust on the door handle is enough to kill this. I am truly frustrated with this, my nexus 6P had physical scanner on the back and it never failed; instant unlock every single time, may be it didn't work once in a million attempts.To circumvent this problem, I can't use face unlock either! because this has got a pop up camera that needs to pop up do a face unlock, the phone throws a warning if you retract the pop up camera a few times. I originally intended to keep the phone for 3 years but now I am so frustrated that I am looking to move to a Samsung or something better.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  So been using it for a week and a half or so ,here's the layman review the kind I would've wanted to read here in the review sectionPro's-SCREEN- so good you'll find it hard to keep the phone away from you for even a little while .It's butter like crazy smooth.DISPLAY- be it qhd or fhd things are way above par a premium experience warm and subtle bright colors soothe your eyes enhanced by the resolution options offered by the phone . It's 'For your eyes only '.CHARGE- it's 'warping' fast I charge my phone at 5% mark and 30 minutes later it is 65 % so the One plus did good on the promise . The brick is beast of a charging plug.REFRESH RATE - ITS 90 Hz or nothing that's how fantastic that refresh is . 60Hz doesn't disappoint either  , the difference between the two is not too much but you definitely feel surfing a wave while sliding down and up it'll be a whole new time pass .lolCAMERA- nightscape mode and normal photo mode are super cool crisp and subtle pics to impress anyone . The pop up selfie camera gives a clean and cool selfie . So pop it like you work itOthers- no heating issues did play pubg on 90 Hz and qhd lasted me 3.5 hrs on what was the best pubg experience thus far . The only reason i reinstalled pubg after quitting it last year was to check the limits of the specs offered by the phone and it superceded it in everyway possibleCONS-BATTERY- 90 Hz and qhd will take a toll on your phone .battery life is disappointing kind of but given high end specs you get at this price plus the warp charge I think the company made its warp charging knowing that .With high end spec it lasts about 4-5 hrs extensive use like gamingWith 90hz and fhd about 5-6 he extensive to moderate use .60 hz and fhd -5-7.5 hrs with extensive to moderate useHANDLING-depends on your hands me being a 6'3 didn't find it difficult at all.CAMERA- even after the update the portrait mode is disappointing depth effect has played a spoil sport .NO DONGLE(SCREW YOU ONE PLIS FOR THAT ;). )NO HEADPHONE JACK (DOUBLE SCREW YOU)Overall go for it just the best experience this flagship has to offer in range of 49k to 53 k .NOTE - DO NOT REMOVE THE GLASS ON THE SCREEN THAT IS THERE BY DEFAULT IT IS THE BEST ONE YOU'VE GOT FOR A LONG WHILE WILL DO JUSTICE\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Do not peel off original screen protector that comes with phone.. reason is currently no screen guards are available and most of glass screen protectors dont work..Rest of the things as you already know.One less star because I received the piece with one noticeable scratch on the screen.Over all worth buying for sure.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Where do i start! Ok one week down the lane, this phone to begin with looks spectacular, atleast from the screen and display point of view i dont know what could better this now. Next up, The 90hz refresh rate makes your phone feel buttery and you will love it(comes at a negotiable cost of reduced battery life) . It\\'s alright though since it\\'s powered with a WARP charger that works like a charm. Talking about cameras now, pop-up camera adds to the elligence of this phone. The picture qulities are stunning at times. I have tried macro photo graphy with this one and the details it can catch are just terrific to believe. 4k recording is excellent, stability is alright!! At this price (42k) it\\'s almost unreal as to what this phone has to offer. Nebula blue color makes this gadget look like out of this planet. Let\\'s not even get into specification. Because it\\'s all just \"beyond the speed\". One amazing product!!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is my first OnePlus DeviceAnd I can say this is the best phone I have ever used .The 90hz display is amazingI can guarantee once you started using the phone on 90hz you can't go back to lower refresh rate.. you will feel and can see the other phones lagging..Camera is not up to the mark but the latest update improve a lot .. and can be better in next updates..Battery life is good ... Not the best due to higher refresh rate and quad hd resolution.. but if you want good battery life you can do so by changing the screen resolution to full HD+ and the refresh rate to 60hz..The fingerprint is super fast..And the WARP Charge , this is amazing..The phone charges very quickly..Oxygen Os is awsm.. (best os ever)Weight - the phone is a lit bit heavy.. but if you use the case you wont feel it heavy..\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Speakers are good. Screen is good.But performance is getting worse.. Multitasking is impossible, if i open a notification and go back to previous opened app it starts all over again. Mi phones have better multi tasking than this i felt.If i get a phone call, and go back to opened app same happens.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Pro & Cons for One Plus 7Pro:-Pros:1. I am a great fan of One Plus and i have been using one plus5 from last 2 year so there is no question of phone getting lagging issue or anything like that, but when i received my One Plus 7Pro lagging word is simply unavailable in my dictionary.2. About fingerprint scanner it is quiet good but just hopping to be little faster, (Personal opinion) may be it is because of on display scanner some micro seconds delayed would be there.3. Popup camera is best in class, face recognition is simply awesome.4. Battery backup is ok you get whole-day utilization time if you are a frequent user.5. Last thing the built quality & design is simply awesome. One has to be only careful for accidentally dropping on backside & on display corners because of it curve display.Cons:-1. No headphone jack 3.5mm one has to buy c-type converter or c-type headphone.2. Its very difficult to put tempered glass for curve screen mobiles i have tried twice perfect fitting is impossible.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Let's start with the first thing that you would notice - size.It's a big phone, yeah. But, after 2 weeks you won't notice. It will feel just perfect in hand (if you don't use a cover on this). With a cover, it's still alright. And yeah, I've been using Galaxy S7 and Lg G7, meaning small phones, always. So yeah, size won't bother you and it feels as premium as a phone can get.Next, Display - I compared the display to S10, S10 Plus, Note 9, Pixel, iPhone. I love this display in every aspect. Everything will always look better. Maybe because of the larger size or actual display quality, I don't know. It's the best I've had. Outdoor visibility is a little less (only when you compare with others), but it will get the job done easily.Battery - Do not go through online review. It'll last a full day easily on heavy use. I'm getting a day and a half - 4 hrs Sot with 32-38 hrs or 7+ hours sot on weekends with a 18-22 hrs standby. Even it doesn't; You won't ever feel it. Charges in no time, Doesn't heats up while charging (even when you're using it). It's getting better after each day.Camera - Again, getting better after each update. I'm on android 10 open beta preview and you get all the features that you want. Every function enabled on each sensor. Default setting is great, detailed images, perfect balance. And, when you want to tweak, Pro mode is there. You don't need anything else when it comes to cameras. Btw, when comparing the pictures between S10 and 7 Pro, you'll like the 7 pro just cause of the display.Performance - Do I really need to review this? Just cut the animation scale to 0.5x in developer mode and it feels crazy. Not a single hiccup so far. This is the best performer in the industry.You won't get better experience than this. You may buy other flagships because you though the camers might be better or battery or blah blah. This the best thing in the market right now. Or, just wait for the 7T pro. 1 months maybe. Best thing ever.But, get a framless cover for 500, it will maintain the sleek feel of the phone. Don't try any uv screenguards, they are horrible. Use the stock screenguard or simple protectors.Cheers!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The phone is super amazing.. It is a little heavy compared to other models from One Plus but that's not a complaint as the phone is real fast with great and simple features.. The finger print scanner is not that great as most of the times I have to input my password due to lockage from trying several times. I think they need to work a lot on this.. Camera quality is super good and even the night pictures turn out to be fabulous.Has a great battery life.. Based on my usage I'm getting around 12-15 hours.. But I need not to worry as the phone charges super quick.!Initially there were a few call drops but I think the issue is fine now..The best part about the phone is it's speakers! Dolby surround is just out of the World and you get a theater experience while watching videos or even music for that matter..OnePlus could have provided some basic headphones with this phone as it does not have a jack.. But i think you can get a good wireless headphone for around 2000 which will solve your problem..\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I was littlebit sceptical after reading some genera and negative reviews about it on the amazon as well as on YouTube...but after i used for 2 days ...i am loving it... camera has gone better after latest update ...and.....and this thing is pure Butter. Go for it....Best in its  class....not regretting a penny in 49k i spent....no issues yet\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Waited 5 year to buy new phone after using Samsung note 3.Can say it was worth waiting.With this price tag and feature I consider this as perfect purchase.Main feature.Screen A+Speed SD 855Looks..even mirror grey look perfect90hz refresh rateBatteryDisappointedCameraScreen is quiet large\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The worst experience. You can't play heavy games like PUBG and COD and even use Youtube for a long time because there comes over heating! They say there is a cooler inside.. But. I don't feel so. Screen keeps freezing while I play games due to this heating problem. Other apps keep closing automatically! I couldn't even share pics via WhatsApp cuz it started to load the pic forever! Still my hands are heating.. Never ever buy this crap.. go for a Samsung seriously.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Was waiting for a good deal on S10, meanwhile OP7Pro was launched so I bought it on the first day it started selling, Amazon delivered the same day. Great service. I received and installed 2 updates, and having used it for a week plus, I can say it's been a mixed experience. Some features work well, others dont. So here's my impression for you.Good:1. Large and sharp LED screen with good legibility. Watching videos is fun. The on screen FP sensor is fast and conveniently located, no delays or misses.2. Dual speakers with clear sound, though music quality through speakers is just about OK.3. Fast and zippy, be it apps, games or file transfers. Doesnt get hot while playing games or charging4. Really fast charging. Fully charged in an hour!5. Oxygen OS is minimal and easy to use. The popup selfie camera is quicker than I expected.6. Haptic feedback is very refined. I used to turn it off on phones. On this one, it's on.The bad:1. The curved edges make it more slippery and the image on the edges reflect and appear distorted, any element there is hard to touch. Collects fingerprint marks easily. I dont find the missing notch makes any huge difference in my usage.2. There is no headphone socket on the phone, no USB-C headphone or adapter in the box3. The selfie camera is average, The rear triple camera setup isnt great as advertised. The main camera is good but gives inconsistent results.The Ugly1. Handling the phone because of it's weight, size and top heaviness, slipperiness.2. Battery life is a shame for a 4000mAh. Bringing down refresh rate and screen resolution made it a bit better, but it's still a one day phone at best.3. Wide angle lens is low on detail, not too wide yet creates distortion4. Not VFM at this price. Its should have been 6-8k cheaper for that.My impression is, this is a phone that only huge screen lovers should go for. The rest should wait for OP7, check if its battery life isnt as bad as this, and go for 8/256 version, still saving 11k over oneplus 7 pro. Else wait for s10/s10+ discount sale. I regret I didnt wait for S10 to be discounted.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Bang for the buck, superb design, top quality speaker, fantastic camera, just one drawback no 3.5mm headphone jack, but expect that  FANTASTIC DEAL\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  With standard use the phone simply died within a month form purchase. Something that you don't expect with a 52k flagship. I have logged a ticket with support and only the resolution they provide may help change the rating..\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  though the phone is heavily loaded but there are certain things which it lacks and is required by most of the common users. having a high camera setup the phone still gives you an ok image which when compared to other flag ships is way less quality wise. i felt for such high end phones 4000mah battery is less, though 7 pro gives you decent 1 and half day back up on normal usage but same back gets reduced to a day or less on extensive usage. last but the most important is the head phone jack,  i was expecting one plus would provide c to 3mm jack connector like they did in case of one plus 6 and 6t. strange thing is they don't have enough inventory of the same.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The phone is a beast. I switched for iPhone to one plus. Not sure if you'll find a phone this fast and smooth. The 90hz is a treat to scroll through, you will feel the difference after using this phone and then switching to a different phone with a basic 60hz. The experience is just wonderful. The fingerprint even though is fast it's not necessarily consistent you'll sometimes need to keep trying to unlock the phone and the camera is decent at most, does the job most of the time. Video watching experience is absolutely wonderful, great battery life, you can expect a whole day even with considerable usage. Absolutely worth the money\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I got a faulty product delivered and it was promptly repalced by the service center, good people at Chennai (Masood) and Bangalore (Anirudh) Service Centre. Overall the Phone is performing as expected worth the money spent. I am happy that one plus is backed by good service center executives.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  \\xa0Display is just smooth and so captivating you can actually play videos of 60 fps & 120 fps on this on full screen mode and the Dolby digital sounds is just crystal clear and the fanatic mode i don't if it's available on lower variants but being the 12 gb variant I must say it is the most powerfull device for gaming, photography, videos , performance, you name it\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Product is awesome but delivery was delayed.the first thing you'll notice is that it is blazing fast. The camera pops up everytime for facial unlock which looks a little bothering somehow otherwise this phone is power packed. Battery life will go on for more than a day for me easily with daily chores on my phone as I am not a gamer.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  First of all, Let's talk about Negative FirstI should say that Oneplus Copied the Design from Samsung and This truly looks like S9 or something like that, its edge Display is the worst implementation, Overall Designiis good, but coming to Screen its really annoying why Oneplus opted for this. Who want a curved display..? If some one wants they will buy a Samsung.2. Weight if the product, it's really heavy this is also may be because if copying from Samsung.3. Warp Charger, it's to make us fools, really, when Charging Oneplus 6T and 7Pro, we surely notice that warp charger is another normal oneplus charger as both charges at same speed, what's the use of warp Circuit..? Still the speed is decent enough but not satisfactory for its name.4. Popup Camera, Of course Design wise it is an asset, but if Safety of Camera Considered then Popup camera takes out the points. If course they shown some circus tricks by weighing some stone to it, but they never shown how many times the motor can handle up and down of it..? If you use face unlock, that little thing pops up minimum 50 times a day and in long run.. Can it withstand..?Here Punch Hole Display is true Winner.Now coming to positives.1. Excellent Display, if we eliminate that edge Display fi a while and feel the 90hz Fluid AMOLED Display, then we really feel the smoothness of it, just like butter, and the Delivery of saturation, whites everything is natural and with vivid option it looks astonishing.2. Both Front and Rear Cameas work like pro, front camera gives pics with over Sharpness may be issue with resolution, but after processing they are good. Coming to Rear Camera, wide angle lens are not Doing its job perfectly, may be software issue, but still Potrait or normal works great, Quality is too good.3. In screen Fingerprint works really great, fast and no need to search for sensor.4. Battery Life, With Heavy Usage, 8hrs, with Moderate Usage,16hrs, with Normal Usage, 20+ hours and I got more than 48 hours of life with Light Usage. Battery backup is Decent when we combine all the draining factors like 6.6 inch Display, In Screen Finger Print, Quad HD Display, 90hz Refresh Rate and all.5. NO need to say about Performance, 855 processor says it all.Overall, It's a beast with some Drawbacks and I personally feel Oneplus crossed its limits by pushing its flagship killer mark to Flagship Competitor, Oneplus itself bought its destruction, sooner or later its greediness to takeover the market makes it vulnerable and make it extinct, I think this is my Last Oneplus Device as surely they will go beyond 60k from next mobile.They say some Quality Comes with a price to pay..My question is why can't this be applied to Samsung and Apple when Oneplus introduced Oneplus One..?Am writing This review after using the mobile for 4 days.Thank you.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I am a OnePlus device die hard fan. This is my 5th OP handset. OP 1,OP 2,OP 3, OP 5 and now the fully upgraded OP 7 Pro. The best part is OnePlus has at last listened to the customer demand and tried to fulfil almost every aspact except few which are not mandtory or deal breaker. OnePlus is OnePlus and no body can beat the performance, charging durability, updates etc.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Monster phone with build in powerhouse in this budget.Great flagship killer mobile with Awesome look in this price range, i will not explain more about the specification bcoz its already mentioned in descriptionbut as per my personal experience i love very much this mobile phone compare to other Android devices.In Term of Battery this is wonderful and with Dash charging this gives an extra advantage.In Term of Performance this is Beast\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Finally I could lay my hand on the Almost perfect high end smartphone,let me explain...Delivery-Superfast one day between the order and my possession, inference- I would suggest oneplus to be Amazon exclusive,they are doing their best for the buying experience of OnePlus products, actually I went to Reliance digital calicut they had no proper stock on the launch week and they were unware of any offers on OnePlus simply horrible experience.Unboxing-This is my first OnePlus phone my previous phone was Apple iPhone xs I was reluctant a bit before unboxing but boy I literally loved it when I laid my hands on this beast,few words from my initial experience,the tactile feel on the back of the phone is something which I have never experienced till date it's a sort of butterly silky matte gradient blue which you should experience to believe it,it's a hot looking phone specially in this nebula blue colour second only to oppo Reno ocean green which I feel is the hottest looking smartphone of this season,build quality is impeccable worthy of a flagship,few things about accessories Travel Adaptor is very huge will be a sore thing to carry around but charges at blazing speeds,Good quality flashy red data cable,an above average pausible soft back case which fits perfectly with some of not full protection,Some people had said in their review about airbubles under screen gaurd and poor application of the screen gaurd and all which had put worries in my mind but trust me guys it's so very professionally put which I would bet you can't get it done anywhere near it by a local screen gaurd vendor even upon microscopic examination I couldn't find any air bubbles or imperfections.User Experience-in just one word it's awesome,which none of the Android flagships could dare promising it to their fans at twice the cost of this phone,with just one update till date no issues at all, battery life is very good even after setting the display for 90hz,and boy 90hz display you should experience to believe it, scrolling,navigating everything is buttey smooth because of this 90hz,the fastest 256gb storage on any smartphone till date is blazing fast,Audio is good but not the best,Camera is again Good but not the best but livable,only one last and important thing I missed from OnePlus is the good quality type c earphone as I couldn't find a good qualityone on any online sites but no gripes,the pricing by OnePlus erases every little blemishes clearly to leave a Champion on this arena,thanks OnePlus and Amazon love you both.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have seen plenty of reviews with praises on the phone's hardware or the software. And both are awazing. An apple like integration of hardware and software. A beast at its heart. Enough RAM to handle multiple apps without a hiccup. No heating issues. Long battery life. Brilliant screen. What more do you need?My shout-out to the Oneplus team that is working non-stop on improving the user experience. In less than 2 month, I have received 4 updates that resolved a few initial bugs only cos they are listening to us and working on the feedback.Own one to see how they keep customers at the top of their priority list.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Of all the things on one plus, the fluidity of the display is a must mention. However from a software perspective, one must mention, the oxygen os tops everything I have used. Minimally intrusive, maximally productive. The touches are thoughtful and subtle. One plus adheres to the Android design philosophy and adds functionality that one needs. No unnecessary bloat from functionality that I would use an app for. The migrate app is awesome. The features one feels are the ones that Android would absorb in the future. Similar to what Motorola promised before Lenovo started killing it off.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  some people says camera is not good. But its camera is excellent even in low light.  It has too many pro setting, not for General public, its for professionals. performance is good, Giving 60mbps (Mega bit per second) speed on Airtel 4G. By speed test. Don't think much just go ahead and buy.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Display and battery is poor.no update is available for this device,still running on oxygen os 9 and Android 9.device is slow and overall performance is not good.This device is overpriced.oneplus customer care could not ensure about any software update but as per my knowledge this device should now run on Android 10.as per device last security update was received in April 2019 .\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Amazing screen best screen right now.Smoothness in every interaction.Very fast.Good haptic feedbackBest Android experience.simple and cleanAverage battery life.gets through the day with auto brightness ,always on 4g and 5:30 min screen on time.Too heavyToo bigNot suitable for small or one handed operation.Finally best multimedia consumption.If you want best experience in watching videos playing games.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This phone competes with the big flagships at the cost of their budget flagships. Pretty decent camera, super snappy and fluid user experience. Fast in display fingerprint scanner and the battery life takes a hit at 90 Hz refresh rate but is excellent at 60 Hz. Also the warp charge is excellent. Oxygen OS is again very smooth being close to vanilla Android. Excellent Display, great camera, fast charging, powerful chipset should do your bidding.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I tell u an honest review,This phone is not a phone,it's a luxury in ur hand,mind blowing performance,best in the segment, every photo wallpaper anything u see in this phone looks mesmerizing, wat else u ecxpect from a phone Yar,go for it blindly.This review  I'm posting after 20 days of using.Battery backup is superb,if u put the screen for 60hz.Display is best no cons in it.Processor...do I need to remind u it's one plus?No doubt the best speed and processor.Camera ..yes here it's ur personal choice I can't really say it does the best but yes for me ..it's more than enough yaar...I mean after Snapseed all photos are classic, don't expect to replace this camera from ur DSLR. üòÑüòÑBody...yes keep it secured back glass is delecate ,always prone for the scratched and even cracks.Charging ...wrap charger the best of all very quick speed ,no issues of heating till now.I'm not a game lover so...can't say much about it..Honestly if I say...then don't go for costly I phones and Samsung sets even not with Huawei, go for this cream yaar...u and yr generations will enjoy the class of one plus.Thanks all .\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have been a big fan of One plus phones as I have been using it for past many years but this new purchase has been quite shocking. On receiving the box we have the same excitement but this time the phone would not get 'on' and show a set up software problem as seen in the screen shot uploaded. This is really frustrating that a phone of this cost will even fail to start , what to say of other features. It seems that the quality of these phones have taken a serious beating. I have requested for replacement. The company must look into such problems as they are very irritating and will dent their image severely.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have some minor issue with this phone. Firstly the screen guard. The phone is 45K+ but the inbuilt screen guard was as cheap as hell plastic guard. Got so many scratches after 2-3 days of minimum usage to the point where it doesn't feels like it was bought a week ago. Don't bother selling a phone worth 45K and no proper screen guard.Secondly, the touch doesn't reponds sometimes. I have to close the apps and then it starts working again and it's really frustrating.Thirdly, the Bluetooth stops working sometimes too when you want to share some files.Fourthly, the camera. It's not as good as I expected it to be. 48MP but the quality is not there. Shouldn't the pictures be more defined and detailed.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Except for display there isn't any stand out feature. I was one among so called 'community' user who got fooled.The goodDisplay display displayThe badCamera ( blind while shooting in night)Microphone ( deaf)The UglyWorld heavyweight championPoor finger print reader ( not secure)Let's forget about waterproofing, fast charge gimmicks.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Love the phone.. Display is gorgeous. I am not very particular with the camera but still it's good in day light shots. Haptic feedback is very good. Easy to use the alert slider.While setting up the phone with data transfer from old phone felt the temperature was high even though there is liquid cooling system. But then it's only one time process and never felt the heat later.It's very huge and heavy. After using this phone and when used my old OnePlus 5T I could feel how thick and heavy this phone is compared to 5T which is so slim. I think OnePlus has to reduce the weight of the phone and also reduce the size to 5.5 inches fire another category of users.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  first time when i on this phone it show system not responding dialog and when i call amazon then send technician and technician do hard reset that phone then it is working but today(25 july 2020) exact after one month phone off automatically its not getting onSo i suggest don't buy one plus ever bcz they make fool to customers.#worst phone ever#not value for money\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was just as excited as anyone buying this model of Oneplus. It is very fluid but the screen difference is not that noticable. The system performs quite well and attention to small details make it feel nice. The OS as such doesn't have any new feature since android, i think is reaching its limit. So the performance tuning is wat is concentrated on and that has been adequately. Only major drawback i feel is in the department of the camera as it is not upto the mark. Initially at first glance it looks all nice and good, but the minute you start to zoom into it then it looks worthless. I wonder how DxO Mark rated it at 111??\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've spent the last 3 days using the 8GB variant OnePlus 7 Pro, and this is my favorite OnePlus phone to date.Pros‚Ä¢ Silky smooth and sharp AMOLED screen‚Ä¢ Powerful Performance‚Ä¢ Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos sound great‚Ä¢ Pop-up camera doesn't feel gimmicky‚Ä¢ Responsive in-display fingerprint scanner‚Ä¢ Curved edges doesn't distort content around the edges that much  unlike Samsung's‚Ä¢ Decent low-light photos‚Ä¢ Great design and build quality‚Ä¢ impressive fast-charging battery (WARP charge)Cons‚Ä¢ No headphone jack‚Ä¢ little bit on the heavier side‚Ä¢ not so good battery life (when using display at 90Hz refresh rate)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Seamless navigation, good low-light images and above all wonderful OS.

The camera quality does not match at all even with 6t. The touch and screen display cteates a lot of problem. On day two of using this phone, the screen suddenly turnee black. I was unable to unclock the phone or see any screen. All i could see was the clock display. And then the finger print sensors were displayed. I could not restart the phone as well for a long time. And i was traveling at that time which created a bigger problem for me. Compared to the price i paid, this phone is a big disappointment.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I had ordered a Nebula blue one plus 7 pro. Received the device on May 31st, delivery was done efficiently, Thank you Amazon.The Nebula blue device looks beautiful. Good work Oneplus.From two days of experience (will edit comment if anything new comes up):Pros:Everything in the news hold true -1. Good looking large screen - fun to use a truly full screen phone.2. Overall build of the phone is great - thought it would be too heavy (200gm) to use but it is not so.3. Battery does hold up for up to 1.5 days on a single charge (I'm a moderate user)4. Camera is decent. I currently switch between GCam and Default camera apps depending on what I'm shooting. Better to have both installed and available for your use.Cons:Again, the news holds true.1. Ghost touches: The issues reported on ghost touches does occur. But this happens only occasionally, does not bother you much.2: Weak speaker - when set to Max phone volume, it's feels less pleasant to hear. Must ensure that it is not set at full volume.3. Phone hangs/stutters when re-used after a long break. Not sure if this is android's fault or oneplus'Current verdict: This is one of the best phones out there, pricey but effective.

It remains to be seen if subsequent models will become serious competition while remaining at the same price point.As an avid fan of mobile photo/video, this phone is usable but still not quite where I would expect it to be at this price point.All in all, it\\'s an okay phone for the money, but if you\\'re concerned about having quality computational photography, noise-free/artifact-free video, etc, you\\'re better off going with the Pixel 4 (even my pixel 2 XL takes higher quality photo/video with far lower noise and artifacting) or spending a little more for the Galaxy.If having high quality photo or video doesn\\'t rank as high on your list of needs then you will very likely really enjoy this phone and for the price I would definitely recommend it.If high quality photo/video is high on your list of needs, I recommend taking a pass on this phone; It\\'s definitely not for the photo/video enthusiast.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Dear all. One plus is just a chiness product manufacturer by OPPO. Donor waste your money on this device.Go for iphon or samsung S20 or S20 pluse  wastage of money.

I was planning on purchasing the OnePlus 7T pro...  But I realized there is negligible difference in both the products... And this phone is alot cheaper than the other one...So I settled for OnePlus 7 ProA great phone.... Has tons of features... And if you're a OnePlus lover then you already know that it's worth every penny....Screen looks amazing... Pop up camera works great... onscreen Fingerprint is faster than previous OnePlus devices...

Definitely better than majority of Android smart phones.. a good quality product...That's the reason it's called Pro\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The main reason why i bought this phone is my old C9 Pro broke and i needed a phone with good Display which can support HDR 10,Then i gone with the hype and finally bought this phone.but i got the problem with the display itself üò™ I wanted a phone with a gud display when i didn\\'t get whta i want for so what do i do with the rest of the specs.After playing any 4K/HDR content ylloew color is appearing on the whole screen even when i put the screen calibration \"Cold\".And when i on the reading mode its worse ....all dispaly is seems like someone spreaded Turmeric Powder on it & its not bright as many samsung\\'s phones.i have been using my old samsung c9 pro for 3yeras and i knw it.Being a movie lover i luv watching movies in my phone. Totally disappointed with the display.OnePlus should update thier dispaly next time with more brighter screen.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The phone is just wonderful! Although the phone was released almost exactly a year ago, it shows no sign of slowing down. The screen is just wonderful, and at its current price point, it's a bargain. Flagship quality for half the price. It misses out on very few features (like wireless charging, but I wouldn't really have used it with Warp Charge, so no complaints from me here) and the camera isn't the best (much better from when it was initially released, the camera captures everything quite naturally, if you give it good lighting though. Low light photography isn't great (especially compared to the iPhone 11 Pro, although that costs over twice what this one costs.) The screen is absolutely mesmerizing! Gets quite bright, but not the brightest. Not overally saturated, color reproduction is quite accurate. In-display fingerprint scanner is as fast as any normal fingerprint scanner, which is great news. OxygenOS is clean and beautiful. An awesome wrapper over android. No bloatware (except a couple of Oneplus Apps which come pre-installed, which are usually deletable). Overall, the best value for money right now (and for the near future as well). Do buy this over the Oneplus 7t or the 8!Enough said about the phone, the delivery process was quite disappointing. Amazon delivery agents don't know how to handle the exchange process. They have no idea how to navigate through the process specified, and wasted almost half an hour of my time, just to give me my phone. I've faced a similar issue with another phone I got delivered recently, and the experience this time around was even worse. Hope they change it soon.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It's an amazing phone.

And it doesn't have earphone jack so it should provide some other thing so that we  can connect our normal earphones.battery drains very fast.the overcome this they have provided nice charger but it is of no use if we are out of the house we cannot charge it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have purchased this phone last week.Very fast in performance with no lags at all.Battery backup also good supported with ultra fast charging.Awesome camera and screen quality.Little big in size and heavy in weight, it will take around one week to get settle and use to it. So no worries for size and weight.Overall its a must buy phone if ur budget is around 50K. Apple and Samsung can't compete with one plus quality.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  forget about the teaser where oneplus7 is dropped in water. My oneplus7pro exposed to rain for 10 mins and it started flickering and screen damaged.Request all not to take that company video seriously and be careful in monsoon season avoid taking pics with such good camera\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Two of the reasons for buying OnePlus 7 Pro were battery life and space. Although Notes app is not pretty much impressive, I need this app to store my ideas and write-ups (I am into professional writing). Moreover, the phone offers 256GB space at a lower cost than any iPhone would provide. For the same storage space in any Apple device, I would have to spend more than 55K. OR I had to choose an older iPhone, which I never wanted to do. So OnePlus 7 Pro was my choice. I can store my data (documents, photos, and videos). Fingerprint, sometimes, needs two-three taps and sometimes, I have to use passcode to unlock the device. But this is OK as long as it is not a daily trouble. If you are into writing or any other creative field, wherein you have to store some data, go for it. And yes, the strong battery. Even if I use mobile data, the battery lasts pretty long...and with its warp charger, it charges quickly. Like the double-tap to wake screen feature...\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Over all it is a good phone. Upgrading from oneplus 3t to oneplus 7 Pro. Battery life is the best thing which I felt in this mobile. But there are a few problems with this phone which I encountered in nearly one month of usage.1) Fingerprint scanner not working sometimes :  I do not know whether it is happening to others as well, but when I try to unlock the phone, sometimes the fingerprint scanner is disabled and I have to use the pattern to unlock the screen. It happened a lot in this first one month of the usage.2) Camera is over beautifying the  pics taken. Most of the times when you click a photo, you looks over beautified than the actual person. The depth of the photo is getting compromised in this way. slightly dark colored people like me will get a shook  when you see the first photo of yourself. :D.  Also pics taken from the ultra wide lens are distorted when you zoom a little bit.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I bought this product because of series name 7 earlier I was using Oneplus 5 since last 2 n half year.After usage of one month .. here is my view.1. Camera is not good as they have done advertisement.2. Warp charging very fast.3. Heating hanging issue while you are using Facebook Live or Facebook Messenger.4. Selfie Camera is poor.5. Not value for money it should be around 42000 maximum  .6. Overall if you are one plus lover just wait for price drop in coming days because sale is not good of One plus 7 pro due to lots of issues and performance.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Screen is great & treat to watch movies & videos. Don't really feel difference of 90hz. Software has glitches & apps crash sometimes. Bought fone after seeing camera ratings on Dox, but to my surprise the quality is very very average & portrait mode struggle a lot with image quality under good artificial lighting. Overall unimpressed with the fone after paying 50k. Hoping software updates will solve the issue. If want oneplus Suggest to buy cheaper 7t else of budget is good go for Samsung s10.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  One of the best phone i have ever bought. In fact i have been a fan of Oneplus since 3 years. My first phone from Oneplus was Oneplus 3 which is still performing amazing though it has been 3 years. Good thing about Oneplus 7 pro is it has got everything you need unlike the other phones which is cheap but comes with bloatware, which literally sucks. My rates are below.Camera - 9/10Speed - 10/10Sound - 10/10Resolution - 10/10Fingerprint and Face recognize - 10/10Over all - 10/10Also, the best part is i bought it when there was better offer available from Amazon, which was like 12,000. On top of this i spent about 1,500 for the screen protection which keeps it safe from the damage. Protection Pro which is made from rubber material mostly used by 3M works really well on your phones.Overall i am happy customer of amazon as well as OnePlus.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  After using a month Not worth it 50k, user experience is smooth but battery life is really disappointed it only last up to 3 to 4 hour if gaming 2.3 hour very bad warp charge is fake it almost take 1.3 hour even real me 3 pro charge faster it heat up while charging. Camera are not that good redmi note 7pro take same quality of image something even take a better pic than a 50k cellphone what the fcck wrong with oneplus image processing and video recording are not good in low light. Now all my frnd are trolling me is this 52k flagship cellphone .Zen mode is FCKINNNG useless my frnd use this to troll me they put without my permission there üò° should be password. AND MOST INTERESTING FOR A MONTH I COULD NOT USE MY FCCKNG EARPHONES BECAUSE THEY REMOVE HEADPHONE JACK AND THEY DON'T PROVIDE CONVERTER DOONGLE INSIDE THE BOX ALOTS OF COST CUTTING ONEPLUS. Buy it it won't disappoint you.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Yes!!! After using this phone for around 2 months now, I have found it to be a pretty solid and a beast of a performer. The phone is snappy and pretty darn quick. The resolution is one of the best and the regular updates we get from OnePlus team is also admirable. Rest camera related opinions are always personal and not indicative of it's performance. Overall a pretty good option for those who want try out something new apart from the likes of The Samsungs, Huaweis..etc. No major or minor complaints.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I bought it few days ago and I am so impressed with it's performance.I am telling you all the things that I came across.Firstly I bought it at the price of 39999 rs.But I exchanged my old phone for which I got 4950 rs exchange .Thanks to OnePlus's 3000 extra cash back offer.I paid through sbi credit card and I received 2500 cash back instead of 2000.im surprised when I saw it.Firstly im talking about display.Display is so smooth and fluidy. 90 Hz refresh rate works amazing.I mostly life qhd instead fhz.Battery life is very good after update.Warp charger works very well.charges very quicky.Camera performance also great.Little bit improvement needed in front cam.Sliding mechanism also runs smoothly. detect fall very quickly.No lag issue found while playing heavy games.Little bit heating issue.but no worry about it.Curve glass looks premium.no disadvantages found.Oxygen os gives u such amazing experience that other os doesn't .So finally.My honest review.which I felt.{Display}  --  4.8/5{Camera}  --  4.5/5{Battery}.  --  4.5/5{Performance}  --  4.8/5{Looks}.  --  4.6/5{OS}.  --  4.9/5{Pubg}  --  4.8/5{Fin.scn}  --  4.8/5\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Op7 Pro Pros:OMG üòç DISPLAY (Esp 90Hz)Good Battery lifeSimple UIFINGERPRINT scannerRegular software tweaksCons: worst cameraNo headphone jackOverall Future smartphone in hand only downside Camera\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  One of the worst product received ever.....don't know wether is the fault of one plus or seller default ...have received defective peice one month back have received my 7Pro through amazon ...now day by day is showing so many hectics .. network is not at ol fetching the same SIM if I put in other phone is coming normaly with high speed only what is the problem with this set which I bought for 42K this shit not at ol worth even for 10k\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Overhyped phone. Only having good in specs doesn't make a phone good. It is also about software running phone. I had samsung galaxy s7 which was awesome phone and after reading reviews bought this phone instead of samsung note 10. Its all regret after that. App will refuse to open up many times. Fingerprint sensor will not work seamlessly if angle change slightly. Overall user experience is not like high end mobile.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  It feels super premium. Below are some of the points to consider before you go for this option.1. Look of the phone is just awesome. Feels like just keep staring at the screen.2. Best display i have seen till date( If you watch too many videos this is the one)3. Rear Camera is above average( not up to the mark which was claimed in launch ) Selfie camera is average4. Battery backup is good. You tube reviews say 6-7 hours screen on time. But in reality surprisingly I got more. May be because of my average using.5. Charging speed is super lightning. Delight to watch.6. Gaming experience is awesome.7. Performance. No other phone can match this performance till date.8. Near to stock android experience\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Wonderful phone got it for 36.5k with exchange HDFC discount and OnePlus referral for 8gb ram 256gb rom...front camera is average back is good..almond colour is very appealing with glass body it's fragile and dropping it would b a big mistake....screen is very prone to scratches still wondering what is Gorilla glass promoted for should sue the makers for misguiding...screen is excellent using it is a charm..battery drains fast on 90hz but 60hz is not bad atal....since all China phones come from same stable all companies differentiate their products this caters to premium n feel good factor..don't chase specs it's useless sheet...check it yourself and than buy..those reviews online r paid ones so chuck those bloggers aur apni akal algao\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I was planning to buy an iphoneX. And then the one plus 7 pro got launched, I was so impressed with configuration and the price that I ordered it the very next day without thinking much..Must say this is one of the best Android phones in market with top notch quality in every feature. No point in wasting money in iPhones..My only problem is the round edges, wish they were straight.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The SCREEN of this phone is magnificent.Probably it can be its best feature. HDR10 QHD+ display üôåThe CAMERA was not as expected at first, but due to OnePlus team's extra efforts the camera has significantly improved (3-4) since launch for the camera.The BATTERY is great for a day's usage but not at the level of the P30 Pro.The BUILD QUALITY is stupendous and is at par with the top players if not better. The phone is heavier than average, which has its own pros and cons.The BUTTONS and the VIBRATION motor give good feedback.The FINGERPRINT READER is fast and you won't notice the difference between the speed of a traditional and an on-screen one.I noticed that the phone was killing apps more than expected. It started killing apps after keeping 3-4 apps in the background (6GB version).Overall, very happy with this investment.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  One must must buy oneplus 7 pro to experience something new! Something great! Three good reason to buy it.1. Oneplus has the most active community and third party developers for support2. Best UI thats is the oxygen OS3. Best display QHD+ 6.67\" 90HZ CURVED FLUID AMOLED..Super happy thank you.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Got this beast the next day it was on sale.The delivery was super fast though the package was just a plastic bag not much protection. Coming to the phone this phone is absolutely beast.

I have used most of the oneplus phones before. but this is greatest of them all.  Great screen / Great Sound. Watch hi-resolution video and audio is a delight. and overall best experience.  I have been using it for more than a week now and impressed over the upgrade I found as compared to my Oneplus 5T.  I am satisfied with this phone so far. A little bit of a higher price for Oneplus phones but Ok if you compared with other Primum brands.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Well It's A Great Phone But Being 8 To 10 Months Old Feels Like A Bit High On Amount Also If I would Have Bought Through OnePlus Site would have Also Got Free Bullets Head Phone Though Have Raised The Complain With Both Amazon And OnePlus That Why U Give Free Bullets Ear Phones In OnePlus Site But Not In Amazon Site But Both Amazon And OnePlus Have Not Replied Yet.ReviewPhone Is ExcellentCamera A ClassPerformance Is Also GreatBuilt Quality Is SuperbNo One Can Beat Oxygen OSOnly Draw Back Battery It would Have Been 4500 or 5000 MAH I would Have Given 10 out of 10 90hrz refresh rate draws to much battery hardly works onefull day.My score 8.5 or 9 Out Of 10\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is an excellent product by one plus..

My views :Pros :- Display quality is amazing & enjoying it- Speed is extremely good- Camera is very good- Some of the features are good in this modelCons :- Battery life is not good. Need lot's of improvements in battery optimization- In adaptive brightness the screen brightness doesn't change automatically (even if you set it) many a time. You have to manually switch the adaptive brightness off & then on, then the screen will change the brightness. This might be a bug, which OnePlus needs to resolve- In the new pc received I found bubbles on screen guard provided- Weight of the product is highUsing it for more than 15 days now & I am loving it inspite of few negative points, being a OnePlus lover. But the company has to improve the product in many ways & we expect the updated in the near future.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Very smooth and buttery.....I am a big fan of OnePlus phones and the performance of this phone completely blown me off.....Good Job OnePlus team.....keep it up....üëç\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Simple good at these price segment i will be waiting so long to get it but whrn i get these phone in lockdown after 2 months the waiting worth these productsAbout phoneIt's all about display.... those who wnat best display must go for it... you definitely observed get different in between rog 2 and OP 7 pro ya  you sacrifices more battery and air trigger bt you got more in these phone water resistant and and camera get huge difference in both\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Writing review after a weekPros :- Worth buying it.- Premium look and design- Lightweight and fast Oxygen OS- Display quality is awesome specially one can feel difference of 90Hz refresh rate vs 60Hz- Best experience for playing games and videos on QHD+ fluid AMOLED- Sound quality is best with Dolby Atmos- Battery life is really good. With full battery it works for more than a day with moderate use of phone with gaming & watching videos- Camera quality is not up to a mark compared to other flagship phones but better than its previous version 6TCons :- No 3.5 mm headphone jack- No IP rating for water resistance- Slightly bigger in size- Slightly heavy in weight- Ghost touch on cornors.

But the fantastic screen makes u forget about that...And u need to use a case. As it is heavy if it falls accidentally there are more chances of getting damaged..Regarding charging 30w charger is superb..Battery draining is not so fast.. An average user can get a ful day charge easily...I don't use camera much... I used Asus zenfone 5z and LG v30 plus previously both are flagship phones at that time. But the camera quality is very nice here compared to both of them..Fingerprint reader is also fast and smooth.. I don't use face unlock bcoz it takes a little time and need to swipe to get the pop up camera open..Got a transparent case in the box.. It is of good quality but it doesn't give a good look to ur mobile. So better to buy a back cover online..Display is very smooth.. Watching movies and videos Is awesome... It's very bright and got no problems in watching under direct sunlight..Not too many customizations we can find here in oxygen os..Coming to stereo speakers, they are good and decent but not as loud as zenfone 5z..As there is no headphone jack I had ordered Bluetooth earphones.. They are on the way and had to use them to write review about sound quality..Played PUBG and other big games without any lag.. Runs very smooth.. As it is 12GB ram all the games and apps we use they Wil be in the ram without getting closed..The phone may gets heated up definitely if we use camera for more time or play non stop games.. That Wil be very common with any mobile..You need to be very careful as it is very heavy it is slippery too.. So u need to definitely use a case for that..My final verdict is if you don't have problem with it's weight then it is the best flagship phone right now in the market at this price.. Lack of wireless charging and headphone jack is not a problem to me.. It has the best screen till now..Am writing now after 20 days of use now.. I observed it's hanging sometimes when playing some small games which I did not get any prblm with big games. I don't know why.. Despite of having 12gb ram why it's hanging.. I hope it Wil be resolved in future updates..And one more thing is proximity sensor is not working properly a lot of times during calls leading to accidental touches which is irritating.. Hope everything Wil be solved in future updates..Thank you...\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  \\xa0Please see the attached video. This was my first oneplus purchase. I purchased it on 20th Oct in sale and prepaid 42000. Got it on 24th and as you see it had faulty Android and hanging issue. I was unable to do even initial setup. NOW AMAZON REMOVED THEIR RETURN POLICY. so you can not directly return it, one TAPORI technician will come and he will check whether mobile is really having any issue or not. Trust me he was one of the most unprofessional person I met in my life. But some how he understood my problem and forwarded the issue to Amazon team. So now my replacement will come in next week.CONCLUSION: I paid 42000 on 20th Oct and I got working mobile on 4th of Nov. This is worst service by Amazon and worst product of Oneplus. Never gone buy any oneplus product again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Thank you Amazon for the fast delivery, before ordering oneplus7 pro I had read comments, mostly negative comments but still ordered it, I got phone next day and when opened it start the screen I fall in love withs phone, great affort put by OnePlus company for making such beautiful mobile phone, it's fast, charging is super fast, graphics is excellent, all set phone, guys you all must buy this phone and get fabulous experience.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  awesome product,really beyond the speed...clone my old one plus phone with nebula blue.. with in 15 min..all data transfer.. by one plus switch..stylish star... macho look.... brilliant..for one plus.. in bocca al lupo for future endeavours...\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Everything is perfect except for the fact that the shipped phone was having a scratch.

Infact i have replaced my previous one plus seven pro and the one which i got and using now has the same problem of heating. You can't use it continuously as it gets heated so much. Charging is fast.

Thanks.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Battery back up is not up to the mark, i am using this phone since 4 months, in early days phone's battery back up was too good, now its battery drains too fast. If u are a heavy gamer, i will suggest u to not to buy this phone, u will really disappoint. Today if i charge 100 percent, i can play only 2 to 2.30 hours maximum(PUBG). Although Charging speed is good, in 1 hour u can charge more than 90 percent. Except battery i do not have any bigger problem ever since face in this phone, one whtspp issue was there, the phone hangs when u send or upload the photo, but later on they fix that problem.

Have been using it for almost 4+ months. 90Hz display is amazing and smooth (one of my favourite these days). On screen fingerprint is fast enough for unlocking the phone. Unfortunately, i didn't used face unlock and i didn't use front camera often. So no comments on that.With 30W Warp Charge, the 4000mAh battery can be recharged pretty fast as well (as per the company's claim and its working excellent so far).Camera is working as expected and also tried few nightmode shots and it is also satisfying.No troublesome heating issues found so far.There is no headphone jack, but i don't have any problem with that as I am using OnePlus Bullet Wireless 2 (Excellent choice for OnePlus7Pro).Ps:- This is my first OnePlus company's product and I simply loved everything about it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I got this for 46k after offer also got 1 year screen replacement guaranty free, so accordingly, this phone is value for money.Pros -1 Looks are great2 Camera provide enough details as needed3 Fingerprint sensor is damn fast as  compared to samsung ultrasonic fp reader.4 popup camera motor is fast and i sometime miss to see popup while it unlocks phone with face unlock.5 battery at Qhd resolution 90 htz display provide 4.5 hours screen on time (a day usage including standby), Qhd 60 htz provide 5.5 hours and Full Hd 60 htz provide 6 hours Screen on Time. On an average i get a full day usage easily.6 weight distrubution is excellent that phones doesn't feel heavy in hand.Cons:low light camera performance is ok ok.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have been using 8GB variant for 3 months.Before this one  , i had OP 5t. 5t never had heating issues whereas this phone gets heated with continuous use.The only pros of upgrading to 7pro from 5t is quality of display , bezel less display , screen size. But 7 pro is not up to the mark in terms of camera performance. Below average camera. It sometimes clicks good picture under good light conditionsMost of the times i use FHD+ display to save battery and i hardly switch to QHD+ which doesn't really make much difference.Finger print reader is fine. Not as fast as 5t that may be because of in display finger print reader.Overall this mobile is okay if you are not a camera enthusiastic.But personally i don't find it to be a worthy upgrade from op5t.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Interested in returning and getting a refundA lot of issues with One plus 7 Pro...1) Ghost touches- the touch screen acts wierd sometimes and apps open up and closes automatically.2) Delayed Response- while making calls, there is quite a long delay one I click call option. Sometime feels like the touch is not working and suddenly after 10-15 sec or more, the phone goes into calling mode.3) Voice disturbances-many instances, when the call is made, voice is not transmitted.4) CAMERA- even after the update the back camera is still blurred. Indoors it take decent photography but not up to the mark of a flagship killer (as these are called). The focus is bad. In potrait (depth) mode background is not blurred.I have been following OnePlus community forums and these problems are common all across. Also different people are getting different issues.Would really like to get money back. But the option for refund or replacement wasn't available initially and now it shows refund period closed on 30th may. Looks like a cheap stunt to force the products on the consumers.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  1. Sometimes touch donot work properly. I need to reopen the app to do so.2. I cannot put conference call.. if I try to do call with the person will get disconnected.3. Camera will pop up automatically during the phone call4. Google assistance starts automatically without any instructionsStill there are lots of issues in this mobile and I m seriously fed up of this..\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Phone is excellent. Front screen is not scratch proof at all. So put a screen guard. After one and half months I can't make or recieve calls.

The phone is super fast and the display is amazing. Love the reading mode. The battery life isn't too great however the charging speed compensates. Overall awesome phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was a little skeptical about switching to android from Apple but when I bought this phone I was convinced that I've made the right decision.Camera, battery, display and sound are top notch. I know people that are using OnePlus 3/5/6 for years without any complaints. So I'm sure about its durability.I think this is the best option in android now and will remain that way for sometime. So go for it!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've had this phone for 4 months now. I'll just get down to what I feel about it so far.Personally, this phone was way out of my budget, so I used the HDFC debit card (zero payment) EMI. I still have 2 months left on it, but I don't regret this decision one bit.The phone is built really well and the pop-up camera has an incredible 'reflexes'. Meaning if you accidentally drop your phone while the pop cup camera is open, the phone detects this and immediately shuts it before the phone drops to the ground.The camera is superb- both video and still. The landscape wide-angle lens is almost at par with the iPhone 11 (I did a comparison with my friend's). The slo-mo video camera is pretty good too. The phone also has an inbuilt video stabilizer. The quality of the video deteriorates in this mode, but in a well-lit environment it's still great!The phone charges really quickly, from nothing to full in about 2 hours.Two downsides to this phone are that the finger print recognition can be a little annoying. It doesn't always recognise the fingerprint instantly. And the other is the mic for capturing audio. I'm a musician and sound designer and I thought that this phone would give me almost iPhone like audio recording, but it's way off. It's a long time before this phone can reach to where the iPhone is in terms of audio recording.All in all, a great phone. Super fast, can play any game, run any app and stream any video smoothly.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Mobile is good. After 4months usage I am giving this review. I received good product without any problem and damage. Mobile function is good till now. But only problem is with screen guard. There is offline screen guard available for this screen. And no mobile service shops are putting screen guard.If possible include screen guard along with mobile.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Before purchasing OnePlus 7pro..asked my friend about OnePlus they has given good review for one plus...now i bought OnePlus 7pro camera quality is good but my mobile is hanging a lot while checking photos on gallery suddenly it will come out from the gallery and phone wallpaper get changed like default wallpaper will appear..while using insta or watsup not able to share pics it's taking too much time to loading..one plus disappointed me a lot..i am thinking why i bought this mobile i spent 50k on this phone instead i hv to purchase iphone.. if is there any chance to return i will definitely return this phone...\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Been almost 4 months upgrading to the pro version of OnePlus , camera could have been better ,missed out on the most important feature the phone not being IP rated. Even than lots of reviewer have tested in water so did I & product seems to work fine without any issues .Despite of having such a beautiful display & 90hrz power pack performance there isn't any tempered glass for same which I can protect it with .Upgrades & updates have been consistently improving without any delay or lags.Pop up camera seems to work perfectly great knowing the fact about limited numbers of move ,insipite of same there have been lot of safety measures for force movement incase occured at time in pocket . I wouldn't suggest to use face unlock more often as the under display scanner is the best in it's class & most freakingly smooth.Glass back is litle bit scary at times as now we have to protect the front as well back of the phone ,for which I use the default case provided by OnePlus themself .Shipping this phone has been a night Mayer for me as amazon weren't efficient enough to deliver the product to me on time ,as sum issue with there shipper & loss of good .which was a surprise to go through .Overall it's a good experience on the handset side ,since there's nothing better than having a 90hz refresh rate & such a powerful performance.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Shifted to this phone from Samsung Galaxy note 8. Display is as good as Samsung and camera is much better. Fingerprint sensor is not up to the mark, it struggles most of the time. Battery is just average, but charging speed is amazing. Phone is little bulky and heavy. Note 8 was far sleeker. But comparing to note 10 plus, which I was considering, this phone is value for money due to 26k price difference.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Too good this phone is amazing, 90 Hz refresh rate combined with fluid display and super performance by SD855, camera bundle is well integrated in its OS, Telephoto is icing on cake along with its mineral glass in aluminum casing giving it a feel of premium phone this device in whole is a complete package\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Display is so delicate my frnds display broken cost 17000, frnds if you purchase, take one assist insurance or use templered glass and screen guard on it, and a good quality backcover, since it is a curved display more chances of braking if front glass also breaks then also full scrren to be replaced\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's been 3 days that I got my hands on this beast.

It's still the best mobile out there in this price segment. Phone is buttery smooth except for the buggy updates. It can handle all from 2120p video to a high end graphic game with real processing speed. For those who are into cameras, I would suggest to look for other options as OnePlus still has to do lot of improvement on camera.Apart from that it rules in every other section like Gaming, Bluetooth connectivity, antennas reception etc.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Using this phone for more than 7 moths now but this one still feels the same in terms of smoothness as day one.

Waste of money to purchase this product I guess‚òùÔ∏è\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  PHONE APPEARANCE LOOKS GOOD, BUT SO MANY DISADVANTAGES LIES WITH PHONE. FOREMOST THING IS THAT ITS HANGING, WHEN IT COMES TO DATA USAGE WIFI IS RUNNING GOOD BUT MOBILE DATA IS NOT WORKING SO FAST, AND ITS HEAVY WEIGHT AND THIS PRICE IS ALSO SO HIGH THOUGH ITS NOT HAVING GREAT FEATURES. WITH SO MUCH EXPECTATIONS I PURCHASED BUT I AM TOTALLY DISSATISFIED. REQUESTING PLEASE DON'T PROMOTE THESE KIND OF PRODUCTS.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It is an excellent phone to use and didn't find any issues in the last 2 weeks. I like curved screens after using Samsung S9+ and this one didn't disappoint me. The audio isn't as much loud like S9+ but it's fine.  OnePlus has to work on image quality, probably thru software update. Always on display isn't that pleasing, even OPPO has made hugh step in coming up with always on display themes; time for OnePlus to step up.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have used OnePlus 2 in the past, I like the near stock android  experience with the oxygen OS. The speed of carrying any task is the main attraction of this device.Though the camera is average , it actually takes good shots at times.If you are looking for that curved screens like samsung, this is a wonderful phone, but with more of accidental touches on the edges while viewing content.Charging speed is very helpful at all times.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  One plus is moving towards premium segment pricing. But gone all those days were Oneplus was flagship killer. I thing instead of investing on Oneplus 7 Pro, we can go to Samsung S10 which has more premium look & feel plus you get all top premium feature like Samsung Pay, Wireless charging, head phone Jack, IP rating, better camera & etc, because here ur not only getting best hardware but best propitiatory software/services to which all come very handy.

Camera quality is not that great as per its price but beauty is they are continuously pushing updates to make it even better. It's smooth. I don't play games at all so gamer u have no idea wabiut would you look in a phone. Battery backup is awesome. Just one concern, OnePlus needs to push security updates on time. Like it was already end of June when we got May 1st security patch. Gcam works perfect without doing any alteration in the system. Nughtscape is kind of ok till this update when I'm writing it. What else left? Yeah just one more thing, it feels little costly, but would give you great feeling of not owning that cheap version of crap which would merely last an year.

Triple Camera beyond words and sounds are like the real Dolby. Warp is faster than 6T charger. All the other specs are the usuals.Cons :Heavy built - weights more than 6TNo jack given - headset\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Overall phone is good but at this range the camera quality should have been better, battery life is also decent and it would go upto full 1 day use with above average usage as it's a wrap charging technology so battery won't be an issue for that, I realised finger print really is not upto the Mark as it's fast reader but sometimes it lag in reading finger. Display of this phone is absolutely amazing but sound quality the output would have been better,its ok though.

Blurs out all the features and smoothens the pictures.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I was super excited for this phone. It's the second day today and it just died and wouldn't start. I had about 80% battery left. I had to literally Google to check if there are other folks facing the similar issues and to my surprise there were plenty. I have used 5T and 6T both and I never faced this issue but it's completely annoying and disappointing that a phone would die like this on just the second day. Additionally I didn't quite like the battery life, even when I am not using it, the phone seems to be losing a lot of charge. The other issue I faced was I tried the smart Lock feature and used my finger print lock and also the pattern lock. The fone would automatically lock itself even when I am watching you tube or using the fone. This was like annoying to the heights. I had selected the screen time for 5 mints but still the fone would auto lock within seconds. I was so annoyed so I removed all the lock system off\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Using this device since July. Build quality is awesome. Dolby Sound and 90hz display are the two main stand out features and they are incredible. Camera is not the best but post update its performing quite good in my opinion.In my case Battery-powered backup is almost 20-22hrs with resolution set to 2K and refresh rate set to 90hz(with screen on time of almost 6:30hrs).Overall the phone and UI is insanely fast and responsive. No lags what so ever.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Its superb in all fields the only thing you will listen about the phone is camera is not that good but its not true it is doing great job yeah in some condition there was issue but almot fixed with ota update night mode is excellent i think remaining small issues will be fixed by ota like sometimes images are not that sharp but overall this device is excellent\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Display is the best in the marketright now, fingerprint reader is as fast as you can imagine, games like pubg are extremely smooth and graphics are absolutely amzing. Oxygen os is just so amazing and easy to use and it's extremely fluid. Battery life depends on how much you use the phone really , if you use camera a lot or play lot of pubg then it won't last for a day otherwise you're good to go for one day. My only complain is the camera. In this price of phone you expect really good camera. Unfortunately that's not the case. Camera is just average. Selfie pop up camera looks really cool and catches some attention and its better than the main camera. Nightscape is just a gimmick. So other than the camera , everything else is just perfect.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Awesome cell phone must buy, best in Android, best in a market right now, best from all cell phones, value for money.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's a beauty & the beast...

Worst service by op service\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The display is the key point which outrage this phone. I just brought this phone for it's display. It feels too smooth & the 90Hz display is way better than u think. Since it's a curved display & huge display with no notches on it you have to be a bit careful in handling it.

Superfast.. amazing look... Best design.. super cool features..Its 90 hz display is love.. i was confused between one plus 8 and one plus 7pro.. but I am very happy that i made the right decision to buy one plus 7 pro.  Its is also depend on your taste.. i wanted the curve display.. minimum 256 gb storage and HD+ screen... Wsap charging.. good brand value and that too below 45000..That is what, one plus 7 pro all about...\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I ordered as soon as was available. The phone looks beautiful, feels premium. The letdown begins when u start using it for a while. The fingerprint reader was easy enough to setup. But upon usage had issues. it didn't work all the time. Lots of time the phone would just keep saying too many attempts & keep asking for pin. The pop up camera started having weird rubbing noise Everytime it was used.the phone calls had weird static distortion in them while they were quite clear on my iphone. I think they will release an update to fix it. The edges of the screen with the curve e resistance to touch and since the corners of the screen r more rounded than others, lots of time functionality was cut off. Like the voice message button in WhatsApp. The screen looked great with the 90hz display but unresponsiveness killed all the fun. It dosent matter if the screen is good . It might have a higher refresh rate but will still feel slow if the responsiveness is low. The camera quality was the most dissapointing aspect. Coming from iPhone the difference was quite apparent. The images seemed more granier and more saturated. The 3x zoom is underwhelming. Will probably install the pixel camera software as the stock software just dosent match up. But then the pixel phones have the best camera processing in the smartphone world.The battery is fine not great, but that was to be expected with the quad hd 90hz display. Roughly lasts 8to 9 hrs on average usage for me. Warp charge is a boon.Overall the price increase for the pro version does not seem to be justified. Too many trade-off. The one plus 7 which is not getting as much attention is a much better phone and more value for money. The difference in value proposition seems negilible between the two.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Screen : It's really awesome.. 90Hz is silky smooth..Charging Speed : It does charge 50% inside 20 mins..Battery Life : 1.5 - 2 Days battery life for my usage..

They are loud but not clear(Maybe it can be improved by changing the some setting or solve it in the next updates)My review : Overall i loved the phone.. If you are a normal usage phone person, then you will definitely love the phone b'coz of its 90Hz screen.. Some user will change the display setting to 60Hz, but if you start using it on 90Hz then there no way you will go back to 60Hz..Pros : As per my usage..#1 - If you use it for 30 mins and then take some another phone, you will not like the other phone.. You will fall in love with the display and once you start using it daily, you will not touch any other phone..#2 - Phone has a 1440 x 3120 pixels resolution and huge screen size, so if you watch a lot of content on your phone, You will love it..#3 - Performance is really fast..#4 - Definitely whole day battery life.. (1.5 day for me)Cons : As per my usage..#1 - As the screen size is huge, it is very difficult to use the phone in one hand.. You cannot type while chatting with one hand..#2 - Finger print sensor - I keep my phone inside my bag while driving, the screen wakes up so many times.. Accidental screens wakes up a lot..(Hope they solve this issue in next updates)#3 - Sometimes some apps do crash..

I'm charging twice daily.I felt bad for no earphone and no premium hard back cover were provided in the box although transparent cover was givenBut in the end it's nice to have oneplus latest mobile phone\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Took for battery, but my OPPO f3 plus had a better battery life than this. No sensor on front of camera so when I try to talk while holding mobile, screen remains awake and calls get hold, record, mute automatically. Not worth of 43000 rs.. Camera quality is not good compared to its price. OPPO f3 plus has better image quality. OPPO f3 plus I took for 23000 rs.Extremely slow, takes minutes to load flipkart, Gmail, Amazon. Not worth for 15000 rs also. Looks like real China mobile, not tikau\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The one plus 7 pro series has serious issue where the application gets stuck very frequently . Within the very first day of purchase I started facing issue with the performance . Moreover the Amazon return/replace policy is not transparant. The Amazon will not agree to replace / return the product even after providing several proofs.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  My primary purpose of buying this phone was to buy a phone with premium finish and a good battery. I dont use the camera much, neither I play games.battery charges really fast, but this monster also guzzles it fast, so not able to hold the battery life longer.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I am reviewing this smartphone after 1 month of usage. Battery standby is my only concern rest are all awesome.Pros:1) Display2) Stereo Speakers3) In-display fingerprint4) WARP ChargeCons:1) Battery stand-by could be improved2) Camera not up to the mark(but OnePlus is doing their best)\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Don't believe negative reviews  every thing is superb this is my 4th mobile from 1+.... Only one thing is little bit heavyweight\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This phone is over hyped. I had lots of expectations. I ordered twice. But not happy using this product. OnePlus is not able to meet the expectations of mine. I am trying to refund or replace with Samsung S10\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  First thing first, this is a Supreme Phone.I got this 8Gb/256Gb version for 40999 ( there were some other offers also - SmartBuy By HDFC made it even a better deal - 2000 worth vouchers more) . This phone justifies the price of 40K. It beats the Samsung and iPhone hands down in Display and aesthetics. Camera is tad bit inferior to Iphone Pro Max and Note 10 but the difference is marginal. Normal user will find it hard to notice the difference. Night Mode has been great with the latest software on.And yes, the User experience is better than Iphone. It took all these years for and Android phone to trump Apple in that regard. 90Hz refresh rate is not a gimmick, it makes every other mobile phone 'feel' slow.Battery life is great, lasts a full day with moderate to heavy usage , even with that 4k (90Hz)  screen on. Lord knows how much it will last if it is turned down to 60hz FHD.Software is on par with iOS as far as usability and touch/feel is concerned. There is no news in  saying that  it is the fastest phone around.After the price cut it is the most affordable premium phone in the market today. Close your eyes, and go for it - you will not go wrong.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Fingerprint scanner is slower than previously used capacitive sensor. Picture quality is underachieved by oneplus. Battery drains fast even in this brand new phone. Elegance is super hot. Screen is a flagship and performs well up to the point. Changing takes more time then it was claimed , ufs3. 0 storage increases a bit of speed of data transactions. Nebula blue colour is innovative. Heptic vibration engine will feel just like an apple phone .\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  One Plus 7 Pro has brilliant specifications. Camera zooms upto 10x. Took a photo of the moon not a single pixelation in image when zoomed at 100%.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  It is an average phone with a good display. Sound is good. Phone is very slippery and camera quality is poor with lacking clarity. Battery back up is average and worse than oneplus 6t. Buy op6t or op7. Do not buy op 7 pro.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Must buy this phone if you have a budget of 50K around- Camera excellent- Performance in gaming- Haptick feedback while gaming- Large 4K screen with 4k recordingJust the battery is a problem a big battery is ultimately used bu big display, but WRAP charging comes to rescue here.Ever thought your phone is watching you, not with this one as it has hidden front camera üòÇüòÇüòÇ\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  'nuff said. If you still have doubts, check the hundred or so review videos praising how good this device really is. If you are in the market for a premium phone but don't want to pay the Apple Tax or Samsung Tax, just got with this phone.Note: if waterproofing is not important for you, consider Asus 6Z as well for a much lower price.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  PROS:Great Displayprocessor SD 855Oxygen OSNice duel speakersGood cameraLower sar value (head:1.187w/kg, body:0.606 w/kg)HIgh amount of ram for great gaming experienceGood screen on time without using higher refresh rate or higher resolution.Wrap charger support for fast chargingUFS 3.0 Supports for faster file transfersCONS:No 3.5 mm headphone jack supportBattery capacity is low for max resolution and 90 hz displaySignal reception is not good like oneplus 6T\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  After rebooting first time battery goes down extremely fast. 40% in 35 min. After new update (2 GB) n battery saving on mode it works far better. I m little bit disappointed in camera section. Look wise its very good.Edit:- Battery life is one day. (Previously I owned Honor play which had 3750mah, but bttry life was 2 day)Selfie is very good.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  You cant take your eyes off the screen. It gorgeous. And the selfi camera is a cool new trick. Over all a great phone\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Let me start my review with cons first as most of pros are know:Cons in this phone are mostly subjective1.No wireless charging ( who cares).2.No 3.5 mm Jack ,well that can effect a few and can be a deal breaker.3.Its massive .. and may be very uncomfortable for people coming from 5inch screen.4.Camera of this phone is it's probably as well as con.Image quality as told in YouTube reviews were completely true.Wide-angle photos are pretty crisp and contains enough detail48 mp camera is true gem and caputurs some stunning photos.Zoom lens is good as well.Issue is it's potrait mode which I personally didn't like as it takes pic in 2.2x zoom so you have to shift for taking potrait shots.and that's a pain but as OnePlus added feature knowingly don't think this will be fixed.Pros:1.its super fast and fluid.2.feels gem in hands.3.Camera quality is good under most situations.4.Beast in performance.5.Screen is something you will fall for immediately you look at it.YouTuber have there say...so use it to experience it yourself.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  7pro is very good..1) sounds amazing üòçüòç2) display so sweet..3) game experience very good4) battery life very good5) world No1 speed phone üòòüòòProblem is headset no slot 3.mm\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Phone is super smooth like described by company. Fingerprint reader is so fast but it can not detect your finger if finger is not properly on the sensor.camera quality is superb,you can zoom in and out using ultra wide camera and battery life is good but i expect charging speed much more faster because it is warp charger. It will take 1 hours and 30 minutes for complete charge. Besides that one con is also here which is 3.5 mm audio jack. People who use wired earphone need to buy addition connecter which is 3.5 mm to type c converter.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I got the device on 17th may and already i can see dust in my rear camera lens .They have taken my device and told will replace it in a week ,online it shows they carrying repair work .Its really not good product .\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's been just 4days I have buyed this mobile via Amazon & it's having some problems like device getting restarted by its own sometimes takes mobile to boot menu applications doesn't work properly I need an urgent replacement of device\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I was so thrilled when i order and got this in hand. But after 2 weeks of full fledged use, this is my verdict. Overall usage of phone is good. Its smooth in operation, fast in processing. But i did not get the feel of the Pricetag it had..Camera: After using the Samsung Note series for almost  6 years, i was very dissapointed in the Camera.. Though they claim a higher PPi, the clarity of the photos are that pathetic for a long distance shoot as compared to a lower version of a Galaxy phone..Battery is not that great but better than Samsung. But still need to see how long that goes. maybe i will have to review again after 3-5 months of use on the battery part..As a brand i feel that Oneplus is too confident now that they have acquired a steady market now and they feel that now they can start cheating the customers.. For this hefty price - there is not even a headphone, the 6+T atleast came with a supporting cable for the Aux, 7+pro didnt even have that.. I still wonder whats the reason for this price tag..I Should have gone for the Iphone XR..This is my biggest mistake i have ever done in purchasing a phone over the years..  NOT WORT THE PRICETAG\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Everything is good as expected. Upgraded from my 5T.The display and the haptics just blew my mind.Battery is also good. Giving 8.5 hours of screen on time on heavy use.Had an option of either this or the s10. I bought this and I'm very happy with my choice.Oneplus never disappoints!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The details of the design are absolutely amazing. Screen, camera and speed are key features of this phone. The speakers have a clean stereo sound. The transition between applications is very smooth. Overall a very good phone to have. One drawback, if you are looking for a handy set then you can opt out of purchasing this.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Still awesome products range by one plus..I am using one plus phone from last 4 year..but they never dispointed me..go for it..great quality,camera, battery backup all are Best\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  After nearly two months of usage I got a fair idea now the performance is avarage. Battery dries out very fast. If you are typing in anything in a app. Suddenly the app closes automatically. Finger readers sometimes need 2 to 3 touches to work. Camera is excellent as expected. Much more was expected as this was a pro model. But every avarage performance. Fixes should be provided to overcome issues.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I cant tell you how amazing this phone is! I have been using this phone since one month.I would just say, go for this phone and you will never regret buying this!My mind was flipping between k20 pro and oneplus 7 pro, review in various websites says that both the phones are almost same in every aspect except the range,my sister bought k20 and i got a chance to test the camera on both the phones with my own naked eyes, and what i found is the quality of pictures on oneplus 7 pro is something i have never ever seen on any smartphone, not even iphones.Apart from the amazing camera, there are alot other features that i wished to be present in my phone. The gestures work perfectly, touch works as smooth as butter.No phone heating even while playing games in highest quality graphics. Yes, it heats little bit when you play and charge ur phone at the same time, but that is acceptable as it does not happen in every scenario and little bit is fine considering the processor.If you have proper knowledge of how to capture a photo by setting uo the focus and other stuffs, trust me you will end up taking a photo just like a dslr camera.Haptic feedback is another amazing feature on this phone, it really takes the gaming to another level, it vibrates when there is a beat/bass in the sound effect, wow so amazing man!Dolby speakers is another legendary feature that will blow your mind! Two speakers are always better than one!The flexibility to change the screen resolution just like in pcs is another feature. If you are worried that 90hz refresh rate would consume more battery, oneplus proved it wrong! I have not noticed any unnecessary battery consumption by the screen! The android version 10 has given this phone amazing utilization of resources, intellegent analysis by android tells me if any website or app is consuming battery higher than expected, this is a much needed feature on a smartphone with tons of apps loaded in it just like mine.To be really very frank, i have used this phone vigorously since i bought it just to check the benchmark of this phone and has not yet disappointed me. The only cool stuff from oneplus i miss on this phone is the notification led, coz there is no hardware support for it, although oneplus has tried to use the screen as the notification led, but it needs improvement and development and i am expecting oneplus team to arrange something cooler for the led.I am fully satisfied with this phone and i am hoping oneplus would not discontinue this product or pushing the android upgrades else it would be a huge disappointment.Great job Oneplus team!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Android Setup keeps stopping. Error occurring everytime I try to start. It is highly disappointing to you know order the phone, wait for it to get it delivered and end up having it not even starting. All the hype that is created by marketing about One Plus seems to be absolutely fake. Very bad indeed.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I am using this device from last 2 months and it's seems good time to right my personal opinion about this device.Display is osm no doubt about it, and phone feel very premium in hand, but it's very slippery so impossible to use without Case.Battery charging speed is osm but battery backup is not that impressive. I am a normal user just check my email and business messages and youtube nothing else.I bought this device around 44k and now price drop to 39999 in 2 months.THE BIGGEST ISSUE WHICH I AM FACING WITH THIS DEVIVE IS THAT IT SUDNELY STOP WORKING AND THEN WORK FINE AFTER 2 OR 3 MINUTE LATER. I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ISSUE WHY SO MANY OTHER USER ARE GETTING THIS AS WELL.Hope this review will be helpfull for other buys are well.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  12 GB ram, the hell !! It's a lot of speed. Amazing display, with 90 Hz refresh rate, that's what a beast is.Love This phone, it's performance is TOP NOTCH. But still needs some camera Improvements specifically  in low light conditions. In camera section it is still under my SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 9.Go for it guys if you are too a hardcore gamer like me.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is my wife‚Äôs second oneplus and she is switching to this from an Oneplus 6. I would say this is the best flagship you would get at this price point.There are no second thoughts about it.The 90HZ display is probably the best in any smartphone right now.The camera is much improved than the older versions , battery life is good and the performance is top notch as usual.It still has a few cons though with not having wireless charging , a slightly sub par camera compared to the other higher end flagships and the lack of a pure ip rating.But at this price point you simply can‚Äôt complain.I would say if you are looking for the best bang for your buck smartphone this is the one you should go with without a doubt..\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  \\xa0Pros:Performance is extraordinary, awesome camera and feel of touch screen is superb. Ergonomic 6is a plus.Cons:Delivered with bubbles between the screen and screen guard.Charger is very bad, looks like it is a used one. I've attached the video.Battery drains quickly even if it is used with single SIM and without gaming.Charging is expected to be quick as it has wrap charge, but in actual it is at par with normal type C.I don't see pocket mode in this phone. My old phone 3T has this feature\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Before i was using oneplus 6 that was also a great phone but after this I'm in love with it's curved display.. Now my old oneplus 6 looks me dull as compared to this beauty.. Apart form display the camera quality also good. extra Wide angle sensor gives more area to captured, indisplay fp is very accurate & fast, powerful sd855 processor gives awesome performance, New 30 watt warp charger(faster than dash charger) took around 1hr to get device full charge(4030mhz) and last easily full day(6-7hrs sot).\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Switching from OP3 to OP7 Pro. Handsdown Best display for the price, fantastic interface, moderate fingerprint reader and camera which i guess will improve with software upgrades( i am comparing the camera with pixel and s10+). Sound quality is awesome both on speaker and headphones as well. Built quality is awesome, no hassle with popup camera. Got 8gb+256gb variant. Battery is also good and wrap charger is saviour. Best phone at 52k.. cheers OnePlus. Never ever settle for less.Ram management is superb. HDR10+ is just fantastic for viewing contents on mobile( Amazon Prime, netflix etc).Delivery was as always awesome. Thank u Amazon for that. Keep up the good work.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  pros:93% screen to body ratio :ofluid amoled 90hz displayoxygen osbeast in gamingwarp charging(55+ mins for full charge 0 to 100) and (30 mins for 0 to 70).cons:battery life ( if u use in qhd+ and 90hz, 4 hours 30 mins screen on time) or ( if u use fhd+ and 60hz, 7 hours screen on time). but then , this warp charging makes it a NEGLIGIBLE issue.fingerprint scanner is not so fast and accurate.......(well cant expect much from a optical fingerprint scanner.slightly heavier than a normal smartphone (well its huge.....)\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Loved everything but one plus should increase battery backup. It i charged till 90% at morning and internet is on for day and just using normal whatsapp instagram then also it will drain and till 8o clock it will be 25%. But other MI mobile with same battery backup will last long for 1 and half day with same usage. Having speaker issue in less that 7 days..upset..\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This product is a beast....with all the features and the 6.7\" screen with the 90hz makes it a perfect match for movies and video.....with the latest snapdragon 855 the phn is lighting fast......But not having a earphone or at least a type C to 3.5mm converter in the package was a bit of disappointment.Though the phn is not officially certified waterproof but from my previous one plus experience I could tell u it\\'s not much of an issue....the device is water resistant to a good extentLastly the camera .....the portrait mode is legit....it has an amazing field of view.....the primary lenses also does a pretty decent job.....but the ultrawide lens is not up to the mark.....the dynamic range is not good and the photo also looks a bit noisy.....so some research is required on that part...The front facing selfie camera also does a good job....my best SELFIE CAMERA by farOverall if u ask me it\\'s a pretty decent device to go with your daily activities and gaming; editing and other stuff like thatU won\\'t regret buying this..üòÑüòÑ\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Finger print is very goodCamera good qualityBattery backup good\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It has an amazing display and it's buttery smooth with the 90hz refresh rate! The camera is a beast tho. Battery is decent. 6hrs sot once fully charged. And while gaming I get around 3-3.5hrs sot in fanatic mode while playing pubg! But people who are looking for more performance and better battery backup and smoothness, I would recommend them to go with Asus Rog Phone 2. By the way this review is from a long time OnePlus user and also Rog user! Peace. Have a good day! :)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is hands down the fastest phone out right now and will be for the rest of 2019 and 2020 until Oneplus 8 comes out. Oneplus tinkers with Android OS to prioritise on speed. This phone would easily last someone 3+ years. The screen is absolutely stunning and the 90hz motion on the screen makes it one of the best screens out. Camera is also brilliant and takes amazing pictures. It's got wide angle lens which I absolutely love. Similar to go pro. It's also got standard lens which takes great photos on day and at night too. And a zoom lens. Battery life is also very good and would easily last a day. I never have to worry about storage since it has enough to store for over 2 years for me. Google photos backs up unlimited photos and videos for free so I don't have to always keep photos in my device. So 256gb storage is an overkill and I love it. The price of this phone is a few hundred pound cheaper than others and is better to me! You would absolutely love the warp charger. It will charge your phone to around 50% in 20 minutes. It is a lot faster than Samsungs fast charge. The best part is that it will still charge fast even if you're using the phone where as other chargers will slow it down a lot. I have zero regrets from getting this phone! Thank you Oneplus for making an amazing phone.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I don‚Äôt how they are charging so premium without quality,1+6t camera was so good so I thought of going for 1+7 pro but it‚Äôs not at all worth it I was using VIVO V15pro camera was much better simply I ve sold it for this worst phone\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Pros:Kickass DisplayRegular Updates/patchesCons:Average camera. What's the point of having a triple camera if apart from the main cam, the other two are below par.Battery life is very average given the size and price. Getting a screen on time of 4-6 hrs.Too heavy and bulky.My indian sim card had no signal in Europe for the whole trip while my wife's OnePlus 5 with indian sim was able to latch on to networks in europe. Both of us use Jio.In display Finger scanner is a pain in the assFor the price I expected a better phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am using one plus 7 pro since the day it was launched in India. I am using the Mirror Grey version.I was waiting to complete at least 2 months before I post a review here.It is worth the money. So many people told me that the phone is looking great and asked me which brand it is.You will never go back to 60Hz refresh rate phones once you start using this 90Hz version.I admit that the phone is a bit heavier than the one which I was using before (Xperia Z5 premium), however, it doesn't matter.4 K videos are just awesome, the camera quality is very nice.The Dolby Atmos feature and the dual speaker combo is my favorite.All these are the Pros of PRO.Now, I have the habit of finding the wrong things when I find something too good :D-  No headphones jack, they don't provide the C-type headphones connector-  One plus wireless bullet earphones are always out of stock- Little heavier- Not that pocket-friendly\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  It is a complete package the only flaw is the 3.5mm jack but u should also consider the power this product packs so not getting a jack is understandable. Awesome camera quality and good battery life lasts me the whole day on only one charge the 90Hz display is the best thing in this device. I just love it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The One Plus 7 Pro exceeds expectations. Excellent seamless transitioning between apps and very good camera. Definitely worth it !\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  bang for buck... the hardware, the craftsmanship.. what a marvel this machine is...high speed surf-boarding is what comes to my mind every time I operate it...runs like the wind... this is truly the 'master of all'... the cosmetic appeal, the functionality and the bumper cameras are drool worthy...All of it, packaged into a mirror grey body that u would yearn to hold in ur hand and grin at. üòÅ\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Presenting the best phone is the budget presented the 90hz is a visual delight, no doubt the in screen fingerprint reader is a bit slower than the conventional methods, camera add an extra dimension to the photography it's not just good it's really good. Nightsight could be a bit better but still it has come leaps and bounds since the 'dark ages' the battery life leaves more to be desired for but warp charge is the best thing to be adapted with in half an hour i can go from nay to gaming without thinking will the charge last or not.... It's just the best...\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It is worth it. Camera was not upto the mark before update, but it has improved a lot recently. And future updates will definitely make it a great shooter.Other than that you'll love 90hz display, Fast, clean and uncluttered UI, and overall premium feel.Only issue is it is hard to find good cheap tempered glass atm and there is no official tempered glass from oneplus available yet.Overall, it is worth the money.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Awesome phone. To start with pros, amazing design and the color nebula blue is nice. Camera quality is good for the price, never settle with the speed. Face unlock is slow as the pop up camera needs to open up and read the face and unlock also fingerprint is slow compared with OP6. Great phone for reasonable price.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I am using this phone from 1 months must say this is the best smooth and fast phone i have ever used till datei think every one knows about its specs and looks so i dont need to tell about that allI just tell you about its brief battery lifeSo if you are going to use this phone for calls whatsapp and media consumption you will get 5 or 5 n half hrs of screen on time or you can increase a bit by lower the screen refresh rate and resolutionBut If you play PUBG in this mobile then it will give you max 4:30 mins SOT and if you use its fanatic mode then you will get 4 hrs of SOT if you lower its resolution and screen referesh rate then it increase a bit by 15 min or half an hours of timeYou will get Warp charger in the box which is 30w charger so you can full charge your device 1:30 hrsOve all its a gud purchase and after purchase i got 3 to 4 OTA updates and oneplus rectify its bugs and camera issues and lots of minor improvementsAlao if you are planning to buy this phone then buy one armoured case for the phone security aa phone is very slim and you can not handle without caseif budget is not your concern you can definitely go for it or else you can look for op 7ConsThe cons i have noticed is its weight,no ip rating and average battery life rest all looks perfect to me\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Great product ... ultra smooth .. great build quality ... best smartphone in premium segment :)\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Pros:1.

Nebula blue is my new favorite color.The camera is the best compared to previous OnePlus products.The battery life is short but saved by the Warp Charge.All in all , an great smartphone.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Loved this phone. The features included translate into a real world excellent experience. The 8GB RAM is more than enough. Using GCam with this improves photo quality, but one plus is also putting software updates. A solid phone that's worth the money we're investing in it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Just buy it if your budget allows. Everything is premium in this phone. Display, Camera, performance everything is great. I saw few reviews, people comparing camera with low end phones. The difference is the new AI feature with mid range phone which is just a software upgrade. AI camera images looks great but are automatically editing when clicked. This is the reason people feel some mid ranged phone phones camera are good but actually that's not. That's just a software they use.Taking that into consideration each and every thing is worth.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have been using this device for the past 20 daysand I\\'m totally impressed with it.Onepluss 7pro is the fastest and smoothest android phone i have ever used. It really impressed me how smooth it is.In performance department it was the best and no doubt in it.I am not actually a camera guy but photos which i am getting are pretty decent.Coming to the battery life, it\\'s not so good. Decent battery life which can last a day for normal usage. Charging speed is really excellent.Display is one of the best but not \"the best\". Color accuracy is not on par with s10 plus but close to it. Though i would prefer oneplus 7 pro\\'s display since it has no notch and 90hz refresh rate.Sound quality and haptic feedback is greatly improved compared to it\\'s predecessor and on par with the flagship devices.Overall its an ultimate performer with best display and sound.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I am using this phone from last  2.5 months.Likes:Oxygen OS from Oneplus is big plus for this phone. It is very stable varient of android available in the market.Fingerprint Scanner is very fast.Camera quality is decent.Battery life is also good that it last about a day with average screen on time of about 7 hours.Thanks to 30W charger which comes with it in the box.Phone is performing very good. I have used this phone for 800 hrs up time. But found nothing serious.Dislikes:Brand: OnePlus is giving awesome phone each time but within 6 months it comes with OnePlus 7T with better performance and features than OnePlus 7 Pro at lower price. They are not maintaining the value of their flagships. I have spent 58k for this phone and now I feels like I have paid for wrong device.I advice all to go for Samsung or Apple iPhones because they are maintaining value of their flagships for at least a year.Camera: It will miss some frames when recording in slow motion. Also there are many flaws in camera system which may be resolved with software updates.At last I will say that Amazon service was very poor. When I ordered this phone from Amazon, It was reached at Amazon's local facility whithin two days. But As I am a non prime member, they took 2 more days for delivery. They were able to deliver the phone within 2 days but they didn't.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Waited a long for it.. Been in love with the OP every since I got the OP 2..

I just charge it once and use it for the rest of the day.. Charges fasttttt.. The finger print sensor is not that great.. take multiple tries to read your thumb impression at times.. Video and music experience on the phone is astonishing.. stopped using my laptop for movies every since I got this.. the Dolby Atmos is a stunning.. However the camera, which was the main reasons for opting for this.. Turned out disappointing to a limited extent.. The rear camera does take beautiful images.. it does take a bit long to click..

Very fast charger indeed) but i last about 15-20% everyday by the end, PLEASE DO NOTE THAT I USE MY PHONE A LOT THOUGH, üòÇüòÖ SO IF YOU ARE A LIGHT USER, WHO CASUALLY USES YOUR PHONE, YOU CAN EASILY LAST A DAY EVERYDAY ON THIS PHONE, I USE ABOUT 6-7 HOURS EVERYDAY, SO THERE'S THAT...If u still want a better battery life, you can always turn the screen to 60Hz or maybe even lower the resolution from the settings to get better battery life...Also the screen is just amazing on this phoneüòçüòçüòç it's just mesmerizing to look at!!!ü•∞ü•∞The performance also is amazing, haven't noticed even a single hiccup in between using apps or anything like that..!!Overall, just close your eyes, and book it!!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am giving 1 star for poor camera quality .The camera is too bad. My previous mobile LG G4 has excellent camera quality even though it is a 16 megapixels and 3 years old.How OnePlus can fix such a worst camera in their flagship mobile which are over priced at above 49k and they say it's best camera.Its 48 megapixels camera not able to focus anything and the final image is blurry.Oneplus should fix this issue.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I buy this phone for it's curved & full view display but there is other department also which should be considered.‚Ä¢Okay,battery life is average,not long lasting as mi or realme 3 smartphone (reason is 6.67 inch large & amoled display).‚Ä¢Run high graphic games smoothly with some heating but getting heated if you play pubg at ultra hd & extreme frame rates.‚Ä¢well camera pictures quality is average,not like in youtube videos sample but this should be okey because other than youtuber videos sample there is not so much difference b/wsamsung,oneplus,oppo,apple camera,But 4k video & normal video recording is very good.‚Ä¢Important thing is it's oxygen os - it is good but not a hyped which many youtuber spread & there is no inovation in it.‚Ä¢Other cons is its lacking(absence) of inbult app locker because you can apply a password with screen lock but also use same password to lock your app which is not good for privacy point of view..So, this is my conclusion after using this for around one month._________________________________For display 5/5Back camera 4/5Front camera 3/5Gaming 5/5Sound 5/5Fingerprint reader 4/5\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Undoubtedly this beauty deserves 5 stars without any doubt..!

Processor ...Actually very fast and with any lagging .In short I m very much satisfied with this phone after using approx one month.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The phone definitely looks great due to its big screen, 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. But it sincerely lags in Camera department even after updates. Video Recording, Voice Recording are great but i am not sure for some reason pics from its front camera just looks average and lacks true colors. Infact, my previous phone Redmi Note5 Pro used to click better selfies. Battery drains quickly if you use 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. Luckily, it has a warp charging adapter with it. Although, the phones gives you premium feel at a premium price but One Plus should look into the Camera Software updates. It's no where near to that of Pixel, Note series or Huwaei premium phones in terms of camera. Except for camera, this phone is a rockstar.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It's extraordinary, only thing which is lagging when compared to Apple and pixel phones is camera. Nonetheless camera are also really good. Not to mention batter life is also good but not spectacular. Major pros of this phone are Display, performance, software, build quality and charging speed which is on another level. Over all very satisfying experience with this product. Well done OnePlus !

I opted for the 256 GB + 8 GB RAM option. With an uncommon screen refresh rate of 90 Hz ,scrolling through applications and switching between them is fast and buttery smooth. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is very fast and rarely misses on the first try. The edge to edge screen is huge and very emersive; being a class leading Samsung AMOLED screen colors are rich and vibrant. Using the pop-up selfie camera is both clever and fast. The camera quickly emerges from it's cubby hole and quickly returns. The phone can instantly detect when it's in free fall and will quickly and automatically retract the camera to avoid damage. A lot of reviewers lamented this phone's lack of official water resistance rating. The phone is definitely water proof. I have had it exposed to pouring rain and placed it on wet surfaces without any issues.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Writing this review after 1.5 monthSo guys the 90hz screen the best part you will definitely call in love with it from the day one it's buttery smooth with sd 855 man it's a beast playing HD games feels great on this phone.Charging is also fast ever morning I plug my device and I get my device all juiced up before leaving office in about an hour.Although it has no 3.5 mm headphone jack but you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy the c type bullets available at OnePlus website (they are awesome) or but the connector available at OnePlus website, so stop making a fuss about 3.5 mm jack (u are spending around 50k here, go buy a decent headphone too).Camera after the updates improved a lot and now pictures are quite good, still there are some issues with lowlight photos but in proper light the photos are good. Front camera selfie is also good no issues with that.Overall a nice phone, a bit overpriced (after looking at the price of k20 pro üòõ) but yes it's still the flagship killer and way better than many of it's competitors.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I am using this device for around a week. These are the things I came across:1.) Display is very big. It is okay for me but single hand operation will be difficult if you havent got big enough hands.2.) This device is heavy. Again for me the weight was okay but it might not be for u.3.) Low light camera performance not amazing.4.) Otherwise camera performance is very good.5.) RAM management is excellent .. didnt come across any lag issues or frame drops while playing.6.) Charges really fact and have a good enough screen on time(for me).There are minor issues which i believe they will fix with upcoming updates and YES they either should have provided a headphone jack or some connector for my wired headphones. This is expected as u are pricing something around 50k and also not proving wireless charging and waterproof certifications......this is kinda upsetting.But yes it is a good device. It will give you the best performance and yea looks amazing. Except that jack issue I dont have any other complains.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Everything will fine.But it was left from my hand and it‚Äôs curve display will broke. I was disappointed by its quality company says it has gorilla glass but it did not protect your phone it is just for marketing.I am unhappy by it‚Äôs screen built quality.I am going to service center to repair it and this product has very expensive display around 16500.So guys it‚Äôs true if you purchase go for it but take care of your phone.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Wireless bullets can give for 12gb ram 58,000/- paying customers. You are simply avoiding...\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Everything is Soo good.. and trust me this is exceptional display.. blew my mind.. feels super premium.. still needs optimizations in camera and fingerprint and some bugs.. but good hardware and super fluid.. just eliminate some bugs to make this perfect...\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Got phone with exchange of my OnePlus 5T in 30KLoved the phone overall.Case provided with is not so good,kill the look of phone .No type c to audio jack converter in box (received with6t)The phone slipsssss.it just slip no matter where u kept it in ur hand, table or sofa. If u kept ur phone on slopping surface,u will found ur phone on ground.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Really one of the best phone available in market. I was bit confused b/w XR and 7 pro..and i feel that i made a correct decision by opting this blue beauty. Phone looks are stunning...fingerprint is awesome..rear camera is good and front is average...90hz screen refresh rate make its usage flawless...No need to spend heavy money on iphones..simply go with this and make your self owning a ultra premium beautifull phone..\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  There is nothing to dislike about this product. I'm in love with it. The colour, the haptic feedback, the feel, the screen, the software, they blend together to give that smooth experience that I was expecting. Never doubted it and never settle.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  1, Display is excellent2. Battery pretty average, drains very fast.3. Camera - you cant compare with Apple and Samsung. Low quality lenses used.

Since price is not cheap anymoreDesign : 4/5Battery : 2/5Build  : 4/5Performance : 4/5Camera : 2/5You need to carry power bank with you or wrap charger.

Pictures in night are much better than any other phone. Fingerprint read is also good just the thing that sometimes it does not detect may be due to lots of fingerprints on screen cover. Battery life is really great. Once charged you can use it throughout the day.Display is really awesome specially the infinity display. All things look much beautiful in one plus 7 Pro becz of such good display.I think one plus should have provided headphone jack connectors, as there is slot for it and we are able to use one plus 6t's connector, so there's no use of not providing the connector, or else they should provide free Bluetooth earphones.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I bought OnePlus 7 Pro(6GB, Mirror Gray)  from Amazon on 4 October 2019 in \\'Amazon Great Indian Sale.Seller Name - Rocket Kommerce LLPOn 9 Oct, my Phone delivered and I was doing the initial setup.Suddenly an error occurred that showing \"Android Setup Keeps Stopping\" and Nothing happens.

Very smooth with super screen and good camera.But this is not what one plus is. It's over prised.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Nothing like this. My priority was performance and this has met above expectations with Snapdragon 855. It's been almost a month using OP 7 Pro and it's working like a charm, you will fall in love for its speedy in-display finger print scanner, multi-tasking and last but not th leat the 90 Hz butter üòä screen. A bit improvement in camera is needed for photos and even slowmos in artificial light. Finally it's a masterpiece!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The phone is hands down great... Don't just fall for youtuber's saying camera softens pics or there is oversaturation or speaker isn't good enough or the fact that fingerprint sensor isn't fast because it is fast...Everything in this phone is straight up great the display, speaker, camera, speed everything except for the wide angle camera.. which is good at best because when you switch cameras from main to wide the saturation brightness contrast changes  with the later being a bit washed out... While takin wide angle pics of a building and scenery is just great.. the wide angle picture of a person withe the scene in background is just pathetic...there are distortions like the limbs of the person become longer (yes you read that right) the skin tone is straight up washed out... Updates haven't been able to fix this yet but apart from wide angle camera this is worth the extra bucks\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Happy to have this phone. .. tried for 12+256 got this. ..

After returning that I got a another now should see how this device perform in day to day life. I hope it would not perform well. 1st impression on oneplus only got disappointed.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  One plus is milking Indian consumers by offering step by step variants.This phone is poor in battery and attract scratch very eaisly.Due to curves , it's not easy to apply tempered glass on phone and most of the shopkeepers struggle on this.Overall expectations are not met.Better you buy 1 plus 7t because 12 GB Ram is not actually active 12 GB Ram which we have tested.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Overall..I would rate it a 4 star phone which has offered a lot however price is bit on a higher side. Would have been a great deal to cap at under 40k.Front pop up camera needs improvement10x Zoom is a superstar. You could see an image which was zoomed and clicked. To your surprise this shiv-linga was 500 meters away from where I clicked this image.Rear camera sometime does wonderful job but still needs better quality as you would be spending approx 50kAnother pic of Lord Hanuman is a proof that rear camera is good but needs improvement\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Best in class than compared to other brands for the same specs, many bugs are solved on frequent updates and hope camera quality also improves with future update.Finger print reader is fast and simply amazing.Battery life is good, the best thing is warp charge. So any where you are get it charged within 20min and more than 80% of your battery gets ready, for safety purpose get yourself screen protector for the phone first, since the display is one which gets affected in case of any physical damage. Hope the after sale service is also good by oneplus.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Best phone I've ever used.I had been using OnePlus 5 before this and that was what made me a fan of that company. Seamless experience with a superb camera. Helped me a lot on my trip to the US. Check out a few shots.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Camera quality is very poor. Being a premium phone, the One Plus brand did not pay much attention on primary camera. The primary camera comes with 16MP, but the resolution is not as expected. The selfies taken by MI is far better then the one captured by this phone. The One Plus brand should take this feedback very seriously and try to fix it up by providing some updated camera software updates.Very much disappointed as far as camera is concerned.The package lacks the Type C USB to audio jack converter. The One Plus should take up this feedback and include the one in the pack.As far as battery back up is concerned, it is very good. Luckily I did not get carried away by other reviews on Amazon :).\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Camera quality has been improved drastically over the last few updates.The device feels premium.The indisplay fingerprint is preety fast.The warp charge is very quick and oxygen is feels smooth as butter.Preety good deal for the price if comes to S10+ which cost around 70k mark.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  A killer flagship !!Display is out of the world with this 90hz panel. It feels buttery smooth.The warp charge is mind-blowing. It could get me to a full charge in an hour.Finger print reader is pretty accurate and also the pop up face unlock is a head turner.Audio quality,Call quality,Video quality,Ram management,Network Coverage all are as expected and is perfect.The camera is kind of good, I mean the primary 48mp and the 16 mp pop up camera are great to use, but the wide angle and telephoto do need a lot of improvements. The portrait mode could also be a bit improved.The battery is not terrible, but should carry around the charger if travelling for a day.The phone is pretty huge and heavy, but don't know if that's much of a big deal.Overall a futuristic smartphone with pretty descent value for money. I definitely bought this device over the regular one plus 7 for the screen and it's obviously worth it. Add a warp charge that can give a full charge in about an hour, a very satisfying haptic feedback, a definite head turner popup cam, triple cam setup and it's very much a value for money flagship !!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have got 2 OnePlus 7 Pro in my family right now.One in Mirror Black and another in Nebula Blue (Both are 8gb/256gb models). As far as looks are concerned, both the colors look fabulous. Nebula Blue looks strikingly beautiful.Specs sheet can be obtained from the description box, so I ain't gonna discuss about it. Review will be purely based on the user experience.Things I like:1) Looks- I'm gonna say it again and again, this phone looks stunning. As soon as you take this phone in your hand, you will feel that you didn't dump your money in garbage. This sure looks and feels premium.2) Software- Oxygen OS works like a charm on this phone. No lags, nothing. It's super clean and useful and highly customisable. You'll get regular updates (august security patch was delivered to this phone even before pixel phones which is mind blowing) with a promise of 3 years of future updates.3) Camera- I'm currently on the Oxygen OS version 9.5.11 and believe me when I say, the camera is not a regular Joe. It performs well in all lighting conditions. All the three lenses are very useful in taking different kind of shots. Nightscape is fantastic. The camera app has been given several tweaks with regular OTA updates and it's always getting better.4) Hardware and build quality- Phone has excellent hardware. Throw any app/games on it and it will run as smooth as butter. RAM management is also very good. Battery runs through an entire day and I have noticed some improvement in battery life after the last update. On an average, I'm getting around 5.5-6.5 hrs of screen on time, which is decent. The phone surface is quite slippery, I was keeping it without back cover, but the sixth drop made me realise that I should put the cover back on. The phone is still not damaged but there are some minor scratches around the corners.Overall- Build quality is superb.I would highly recommend this phone to someone who wants a high performance phone with quality hardware.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Though I liked the phone very much, I was shocked to note that there was no User Manual. I checked online too but not available online too. When I contacted Oneplus for the same, I was informed that manual must be inside the box or I should contact Amazon from where I bought the phone. Unfortunately I can not find a way to contact Amazon and as a result, I am not in a position to use my Phone fully.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I just brought it 15days ago and one plus 7T got released with same features and 20000 less price and it has fallen from just 35cm and screen got broken.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Will keep it concise & helpful:Oneplus has successfully manufactured a device, very capable in almost every aspect; here are the pros and cons though:Pros:1. Sturdy & beautiful built2. Immersive screen(even at 60Hz its beautiful, 90Hz just takes it to the next level)3. Loud sound & crisp, clear voice( in voice calls)4. Blazing fast...Never hangs or freezes...5. Camera hardware is top notch!6. Perfect weight distribution, feels so great to even hold it.Cons:Battery's just an average performerFingerprint reader takes a few days/weeks to calibrate.Camera software should be tweaked and improved, hardware has a lot of potential\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Excellent phone.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I waited patiently for a month to buy the Almond edition and by god it was worth it. The beauty of this variant is very difficult to capture in photos, it really needs to be felt first hand.Coming on to the device itself, it is a monster, in every way. The battery is pretty good, fingerprint sensor works most of the time, vibration motor is amazing, 90 hz is the Trump card. Everything about this phone is spectacular except:The fact that OnePlus have decided to skip the headphone adapter in the box. I covered myself in this regard by buying it before the phone itself but it has been out of stock ever since. There is no reason to omit it from the box.OnePlus has said that it is splash proof, but an official IP rating would have been nice.I don't use wireless charging but for a phone that costs 50k, it should have been there. But I understand OnePlus' point of view that it is better to do it properly.Wide angle video missing, coming as a future update, portrait mode uses telephoto lens.Overall the best phone you can lay hands on.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I would be more than happy if someone help me to report all issues i am facing with device to one plus 7 pro authority.I think the device i am using is not up to the mark as it's performance is very poor as compared to OnePlus6,  OnePlus6t, OnePlus7 and other OnePlus7Pro,  may be it's defected piece.Everytime while using almost every application like FB,  Netflix or any other the device is getting freeze and personally i don't think so that is common for oneplus device when you have 256GB ROM and 8GB RAM out of which 100GB is available to use.My friends who are using OnePlus6,  6t or OnePlus7 giving them better performance as compared to my device i. e.  OnePlus7Pro.Camera quality for my device is very poor,  unclear and not up to the mark.Portrait feature is not working properly.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Camera is awesome. Display couldn't be any better. Processor is good. A bit big screen to handle. Finger print sometimes doesn't recognize. Very smooth to operate. Only drawback is the battery. It drains a lot for 4000 mah capacity. It will still last around 24 hours without games.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  After 5 months of usage this phone is great. And i feel this is a better phone than OP 8 for price and specs. It should slow down only through updates. Solid performance and best battery performance with super fast charging.Pop up camera is the best for privacy as i actually don't use front cam mostly and will getting full screen with any notch and punch holes.Bought it for 43k 256GB + 8 GB Ram\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Phone is excellent but there are some cons also which are 1) No Earphone (only Bluetooth)2) Warp charging doesn't work ... For me in 20min it charge only 35%Battery backup is also not that great while playing games.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The phone is good but there are too much software issues in OnePlus 7 pro feeling very bother on purchase of 7pro. This problem is not solved until the developer's team of OnePlus do something too much software issue in this device. Finally waiting for good and stable updates.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It was slightly better than all basic Chinese phones..like Mi note6/7 pro.. but a big miss in VOLTE CALLING /VOWIFI feature is not available even in oneplus 7pro models.. big disaapoinment at huge cost. Don't buy unless you don't want to use VOLTE or VOWIFI features..as this phone overpriced with lack of VOLTE calling features..in India..Also basic headphone jack converter should be given along with the inbox items after all we are.paying huge money.. company is not interested to give us the headphones .or wireless headphones even..I have a feeling of wasting 52,999 rupees in it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Nothing's beats the price point OnePlus is giving. Build quality is awesome. As far as the camera concern, you better get Gcam mod. Talking about the battery life you can get two days battery if you are using your phone for recieving calls and a bit surfing. I spent whole day in tracking and shot 400 beautiful pictures of mountains covered in clouds and a few stunning slow mo videos. Even after a whole day of photography and sharing my pictures, I left with 40% of battery in my phone and that's fantastic. Just love this phone.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Only 1 word its just \"AWESOME\"I read some negative reviews for camera performance, but im really very happy with the camera n will give it a 5*.

Some other apps got stuck at 90 percent.But, most of the apps got installed fine. I reinstalled the OS to see if the problem gets solved, but no!2. 90 hz display looks good most of the time (70 percent of the time). Other 30 percent of the time, it lags a lot. I don't think I even got 10 hz at those times. It mostly lagged while scrolling apps, browsing internet, e.t.c3. Screen doesn't go off to sleep after 30 sec. Of inactivity, as specified in settings,. We have to force it most of the times by clicking power button.4. Haptic feedback doesn't work more than half the time.

Camera could have been better but I'm overall satisfied with the camera because I believe it's not about the tools when it comes to photography.The infinite curved display with stereo speakers give the best viewing experience when it comes to watching movies / series on the phone.Simply, go for it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Powerful delivery by Amazon one day prime dayThe phone is very beautiful design vise color is lovely sleek design Pop up Camera is very fastAll the specs were mind blowing\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Well being a OnePlus user from the 5th Generation of their models, I would say they've come out to be one of the best players in the competition.Talking about the Display it's fantastic, you would love to use this device all the time when it is in your hand. I wouldn't say it's big, but rather it's immersive. And rhe refresh rate is just the icing on the cake.The battery life is also nice, much better than I thought as a day would be enough for a heavy user, and there's no need to worry as the Warp Charger is there to help you out.Now the main weakness on of this phone is the camera. Well it's not that bad but it's not what everyone would expect from a OnePlus device for the premium pricing, well it's kind of descent, much more similar to the previous generations, just the wide angle lens is the main centre of attraction.And at last the built quality and performance, hands down, unbeatable!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Let's get the cons out of the way. I noticed mainly 3 things that may concern buyers.1. Form Factor- The size and weight of this phone is too big. Even if I have bigger hands.its impossible to use in one hand. You will get used to the weight but when u pick up other devices u will feel OnePlus 7 pro could have better weight balamce. It may pain a little if u are lying down and watching any video for a long time.2. Battery life - on paper 4000 mAh battery looks good.but it's battery back up is average. I am getting little more than  4 Hrs screen on time. U can increase the battery by turning off 90 hz . Buts what's the point of turning it off while 90 hz is the reason u r buying this phone.3. No always on display- Coming from Samsung phones I really miss the always on display features. Thought it has ambient display but u can never see notification unless u touch the phone. Don't know why OnePlus did not give this feature. At least give a option to turn it on or off.Now let's talk about advantages of this phone.1. Display- oh boy.u can enjoy this beauty of display all day long. Quad Hd 90 HZ amodled display is stunning. Once u use 90 hz other phones will feel slow and that includes iPhone too.yeah u heard that right.2. Sofwtwere experience- oxygen Os is so close to stock Android and in some cases it it better. Buttery smooth animation and super quick Android updates makes it one of the few devices having Android 10 at the time I am writing this review3. Sound Quality- This phone does have a decent dual stereo speaker which gets very loud. Audio quality is great also has Dolby Atmos support.4. Haptic feedback - I did not think earlier vibration  motors are to be considered as an advantages. But this phones vibration feedback is precise and strong. U will feel joy typing on this phone for sure.5. I was sceptical about this phones camera because many reviewers said camera is the weakest point of this phone. But I found the main 48 mp sensor as good as S10, iPhone 11 level. Though it's secondary cameras lacks behind those flagships.  U can tweak the photos little bit and will get excellent result. One plus nighscapeobe is brilliant. Better than Samsung's night mode.6. Performance - Snapdragon 855 and adreno 640 is more than capable of heavy tasks and gaming and this phone is no exception. Never faced any lag. That's it.Verdict- The pros overweights the cons by very long margin. If u can manage the weight or size this phone will bring a smile on your face. Thanks.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Got a faulty screen... Thanks Amazon for a delayed but complete replacement.After abt 2 weeks...Great device at its price. 90hz display and 1440p at hdr are very battery hungry... Also to protect the oleds... max brightness is controlled in manual brightness setting. Auto brightness may help in broad daylight but may burn the oled with prolonged periods of usage.Rest is all good performance, speakers, charging.No heat issues even with full performance gaming.Included case is very cheapish in appearance.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Camera Quantity very dispointed me very bad when campare to my one plus 6TNo clarity photos very sad,Especially potriet mode it crops and zoomy and also sheks,48mp it's only in pro mode  not in default mode,3x zoom Very bad its not worthy no clearty photos also.Battery life ok ok not upto the markWe r giving almost 50k it's not worthy for this phone\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Just getting use to of its supersonic speed.

The only complain is it's to heavy 4G only in Indian market, lake in wireless charging, can have a better battery capacity. Also kind of a need suit for PC for better connectivity. Overall a good phone in market at present. Feels premium to use especially for people upgrading from xiaomi MIUI to OnePlus.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Display is awesome. Buttery smooth touch. Samsung's display looks better cz of the color vividness and saturation. But this one is one of the best display. Processor? 855 sd no need to say more about it. Sound is supergood but still searching for earphones suitable with this device. Just disappointed with the camera. Wide angle is just useless as it has lower angle of view and when you zoom into clicked image its blurry. Same with normal pic. It looks good until you zoom. Pics clicked are not sharp they r soft and blurry. Even redmi phone 15k priced clicks sharper pics than this. 4k 60fps video is certainly something it saves this phone as clarity is really superb. Battery backup is below average for the price you are paying for this device but super fast charging makes up for it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  \\xa0I don't think Amazon has sent me a original and brand new phone. The screen doesn't respond to touches most of the times and the fingerprint doesn't work already. I had the one plus 5t and didn't face any such issues but the customer care checks it for 5 seconds and says it's okay but it's really not working well. The fingerprint reader is slow.

Fingerprint sensor is not at all quick. Battery life is pathetic. Speakers have some aberration coming out of them. Phone heats up all the time. I don't understand the point of launching a costly phone with lower performance.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I got Nebula Blue 8GB variant. Awesome speed with matching 90hz smoothness. Camera quality needs improvement (I hope they will improve camera quality in future OTA updates). Battery life is pretty good. I play Pubg and Asphalt and battery lasts for a day. Display so buttery smooth that I cant take my eyes off it.Fingerprint sensor is way too fast.Very happy with overall performance of the phone.Can be improved:Camera qualityBack case. Default one looks like cheap one and destroys overall look of the phone.Default screen guard. (dust magnet)\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Disappointed with Amazon delivery as I had to wait 6 days for the delivery of the device after making payment in advance. The wait was worth it. The phone is bundled in a premium box with a letter from the founder and invitation to join the OnePlus forums. This was a nice touch.Retail box: Box contains the device, warp charger, documentation, SIM eject tool and a clear silicone phone sleeve. Headphones and/or USB type c to 3.5 mm jack is missing. 4/5Design: I ordered the nebula blue version of the phone. The front of the phone is all display with minimal bezels. The curved front gives a premium appearance to the device. The back of the device has a frosted blue glass finish. The back is resistant to fingerprints while the front is a fingerprint magnet. The phone has stereo speakers with the earpiece above the display functioning as one of the loudspeakers. The bottom firing speaker is present on the bottom bezel of the screen. The loudspeakers are loud and produce pleasant sound.Display: the QHD 90Hz HDR AMOLED display is a gorgeous work of art. The display is buttery smooth and the experience of interaction with the curved screen is a joy. The embedded in display fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurate.Camera: the front popup camera is a fixed focus unit. It produces bright images with adequate amount of details. The front camera is good for video calls. The back 48 MP camera is good in bright light conditions. Produces noisy images in low light conditions. Using GCAM or nightscape mode helps render usable night shots. The wide angle camera is a nice addition but the rendition and the amount of resolved detail are inadequate. The telephoto camera helps create 3x lossless zoom. The resolved details are usable for social media but not good for prints.Performance: the phone is blazing fast. The 8 GB RAM is more than adequate for day to day usage. The on board storage is blazing fast. The OxygenOS is a great implementation of android that is fast and has many usable additions to stock android.Battery life: The battery lasts 2 days with my daily usage involving 1 hour of web browsing, 1 hour of streaming videos and about 1 hour of phonecalls. The bundled fast charger is great. It charges the battery to 80% in 30 minutes.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Amazing in every possible way. While everything is top notch quality, the screen is just mesmerising and completely notchless. Loving every bit of it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Best one from One Plus. Earlier I was using One Plus 6 and was planning to buy new phone. Have surfed a lot for buying now phone and then finally decided to go for this. No issues till date after using it for one week.

Can play PUBG on HDR and Extreme graphics without any sort of lag. Too smooth.In display fingerprint scanner is the fastest I've ever seen.10 layer cooling tech works like wonders. Its nearly impossible to get this phone too hot. Even after long periods of gaming it stays cool.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I am writing this review after 9.5.10 update & after using it for more than 1 month.Pros:1.Display (though brightness could have been better) - My friends are just awestrucked by the quality of display OnePlus has put in. They say \"ufff!! Display ta dekh just, chokchok kor6e\" (Look at the display, it\\'s shining), \"Side theke dekh, sera, sera, kato daam re phone tar, amio kinbo\" (look at from the sides, awesome, awesome, how much does this phone cost,I will also buy it).2.Battery life - 1 day battery backup for heavy users. If used in dark mode and 30-40% brightness in auto switch & 90hz mode you may get upto 1.5 days battery life. But even if the battery get drained warp charge will charge it in an hour.3. Vibration - Best among most of the android phones out there but only bettered by iphone.4. Performance - Best performer till date. Oneplus\\'s software is the benchmark for the mobile industry. Take a bow oneplus.5. Sound Quality -  Loud & Crisp. Though a little more depth would have been appreciated.CONS1. Camera - Camera is a mixed bag. It takes inconsistent photos. But yesterday I received 9.5.10 update which corrected the over warm tone of the photos. People don\\'t look too pinkish & focusing is also improved. Wide angle lens can\\'t be used in videos as of now but oneplus is working on an update & will introduce this feature surely. Selfies are ok. In comparison to pixel & iphone & samsung\\'s flagship phones this camera may be inferior,but I have to say oneplus is able to improve the camera performance of this mobile through multiple updates. Now I am satisfied with the camera performance of this beast. Camera isn\\'t a deal breaker anymore.2. Lack of headphone jack - Even the type c to 3.5mm headphone is not included within the box & after 2 months of this phone\\'s launch oneplus is still not able to make it available to purchase from online or offline stores. Shame on you oneplus. You couldn\\'t give an adapter worth ‚Çπ390 (manufacturing cost is ‚Çπ40) in the box of a ‚Çπ50k rupees phone. This is my biggest gripe using this phone. But it\\'s a fault of OnePlus not the phone.Edit : Today I bought oneplus\\'s official audio adapter from their website for ‚Çπ439 (including shipping fee).3. No IP rating & wireless charging - though I don\\'t need them.4. Customer Support - No where near the quality of this phone. Few service centres are available. Most of the accessories are out of stock. I am very disappointed with the service of oneplus.5. Tempered glass - No official tempered glass launched by oneplus for op 7 pro whereas it\\'s available for the regular 7. I purchased an uv glue glass from a local shop worth ‚Çπ600 & the glues are spreading from the sides of the phone. Oneplus should have released their official tempered glass for their best phone.6. Price - I read from the internet that the manufacturing cost of this phone is ‚Çπ22k. But you are charging more than  double the manufacturing cost. This phone should have been priced at ‚Çπ40k,though it\\'s cheaper than samsung and apple\\'s flagships.ConclusionMost of the cons I mentioned are related to the support of oneplus not of this phone. Hence,I would suggest everyone who is looking to buy a real flagship, take this one & you won\\'t regret.Final rating9.5/10\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Best phone ever, the only problem is sometimes while selecting photos using watsapp, it's getting stuck. I checked with one of my friends as well, he too had the same issue. Hopefully this will resolve in future patchings\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Honestly i love iphone and from the reviews and ratings of this product considered me to buy this phone but my previous phone iPhone 7 was too good and i was not too happy with my new android so i gave this oneplus to my sister and bought iPhone 11 and im very happy with my decision.For me no phone is better than apple iPhone i mean iphones are the leader of phone industry and for this oneplus I don‚Äôt like this phone too much i mean its good for those who likes to live with android.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  First of all I regret buying a Chinese mobile phone and I urge all my Indian brother and sister to stop buying any Chinese mobile or any article to extent possible.

All doubts cleared though as i have been using it since last week.I have cut one star because i believe it can improve further on camera and fingerprint sensitivity as well as few tweaks in software (like u cant seperately lower down notification volume); otherwise, it is a phone to have in 50k range!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Mobile has good battery, excellent sound quality,but oneplus accessories (original) not available in open market, I've searched for screen glass , but in oneplus official store also not available till now for one plus 7 pro, worst maintenance for oneplus and one complaint is unnecessary movement of popup cam during mobile in pocket while sitting and standing.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am diehard fan of one plus but this time I was disappointed coz of its camera quality even..one plus 5 has better camera quality than it..  pop selfi camera is also not good ..the picture are blurred after captured...it's battery is not good as previous phones coz it's drained fastly...nd also disappointed for headphones jacks...or even in the time of unboxing u shown there are Bluetooth headset but I didn't get any headset..u should provide headset with phone when we paid 50 k...\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Demerits Very heavy it weighs like a powerbank.Low light camera is not up to the mark compared to oppo f11.Wide angle videos not supported.No headphone jack nor a connector in box which is very bad.Pricing toooooo much.MeritsWarp charging is superbBattery backup is also good but not up to the mark.Front camera is unimaginably good.Gestures and performance are excellent.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Adaptable usage, captivating screen presence, amiable towards eyes, diligent software, and a phenomenal experience using this phone.

Glass back with matte finish combined with curved glass adds a touch of premiumness to the phone. I have done some nitpicking although after thorough use of the device for 4 days.1. Fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow sometimes. I have heard that it keeps on improving as days pass by. But it is annoying sometimes.2. SOT is somewhat between 5-6 hours with normal usage,  it would have been good to have around 4500mah battery capacity.3. Sensors does not work smoothly every time, auto brightness is aweful, fingerprint unlock misses one out of five times and pick up your phone to show has low response.4. Phone is heavy, would require time to get adjusted.5. Photo quality is great at daylights, but at night the corners get washed out a bit.6. Horizon light feature is just laughable, it happens only for a single time once a notification pops up and not at a certain interval.7. No 3.5mm headphone jack.None of the google, samsung, apple or huwaei provides latest flagship below 50k price range, so if you can live with the cons mentioned above, then happily buy this device.One more point, got the android 10 update on the same day I received the device from amazon. Thumbs up for oneplus support.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Have being using it since last 2 days .. Didn't find any feature which is new or unique to 1+7 series.

Very helpful.Did not use camera or finger-print reader till now.Overall a prized possession who has been using BlackBerry for over 10 years and, after its discontinuance, was looking for equally good product.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I am a huge fan of one plus mobiles , for the 1st time I have bought one plus 7pro , all features are excellent but only three problems are bothering me1st one : though I kept the fingerprint reader security for phone  it doesn't working properly and phone lock  is opening  up like a normal like named swipe up2nd one : sometimes fingerprint scanner tooks more time to unlock the phone3rd one : battery life is not greater , when compared to Samsung j7 series  it doesn't gives 60%of battery life of j7Please work on it and update me how to solve my problemsI never want to change my brand from one plus , and if the problem continues how can I be tied up with you\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Battery drain problem and hanging problem in this one plus 7 pro 12gb ram.very worst phone of one plus in one series and cost is too much high and it doesn't deserve this cost.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Waste of money only speed,  Changing speed also not good same like oneplus 6 ,fingerprint is less secured open using some tricks, camera is too poor for money\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  2 months on and the experience has been great so far. Whether it's about taking pictures or watching that high-res video song is just a matter of pure indulgence. Totally in love with the 90 Hz Display that gives videos and live wallpapers an extra fluid factor. Camera quality is superb and the overall processor response is like overwhelmingly good. Initially there were some lags with opening of the camera those are not present now after the updates. Kudos to the OnePlus Team for giving a nice finish to the exterior look and overall aesthetics of the Phone. True Notch-less Experience that is worth owning.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Overall average product for the price i paid. The disaster is internet speed is superrrrrrrr slow in this.  i was using oneplus3 previously and switched to this model now and now I can't use internet at all. Beware before buying this product.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  its a great phone in this price segment.  best display, premiums looks and built quality, the fastest phone, smoother experience, best choice for heavy gamers and for the best graphics..the only con is average berry life.. if you are a heavy user..u will have to charge twice in 24 hours..but quick Dash charge is super fast.. so if twice charging in a single day is ok then go for it..face unlock is but slower as popup camera takes time to get opened. overall its the best flagship smart phone if your budget is around 40-50k..\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Super awesome product in such a cheaper price. It's my first time using android phone and have to say that one plus delivers a very premium quality in such a low price. I would everytime recommend this product to those who are thinking to buy apple or samsung smartphone, just give this phone a try it will never disappoint you. The fingerprint scanner, camera, gaming experience, movie watching experience are some of the things has always been at the top notch for me.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I had an option of getting the S10+ or the OP 7 Pro. Glad I went for the latter. Firstly, I do not spend big bucks on a phone for camera. I base my purchases on a phone for the performance and the speed.  Even though the camera is not as good as S10+  the OP 7 Pro makes up for it by having notchless display and 90 Hz. When people say there's hardly any difference  between 60 Hz and 90 Hz it is not true.  I also went for 12 Gb option so this helps battery draining apps to run in the background. Only issue is the battery does not meet my expectations and the whole charge barely lasts 18 hours.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Worst product because at this price this is not water proof and they claim it as water resistant but that is not true as my phone screen got completely damaged in minor rain. Don‚Äôt buy this at this price.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Everything is superb ....minor changes needed....battery life could be better but good as compared to the display size and quality.....the dispaly and camera are the best one....Get a major issue with the device.....its get swtich off as i connect it to charging......one month review.....i really hate one plus now.....first one plus device may be the last one tooo.....\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Product is as per description. Screen guard had bubble. Camera quality is good.Battery when charged 100% will run full day. Speed is good.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Firstly, a great phone, all the features which it has right from the notchless display to the 90Hz refresh rate coupled with the space and the UFS 3.0 transmission, this device works buttery smoothWith the android 10 update now availale, the phone has only improved system and UI experience wise with dark mode and the addition of digital well-being.Though a bit overpriced than Redmi K20 pro, i feel if you really want a great UI experience with the Oxygen OS and dont mind spending a little more for a phone, this phone will serve you atleast 3-4 years making it value for money\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Let me begin by saying that the display is just amazing. Everything is buttery smooth and fast. Coming to the fingerprint scanner it could be better because sometimes it takes time to read. Face id is fast, although i have nothing else to compare it with but still good. And camera to be honest is actually good and night mode is little bit sumdgy somtimes but still captures good night pictures. Video recording is the best i gotta say, it is very stable. The only problem i found about the video is the 4k 60 fps mode, the file size is so large it is actually impossible to record more than 10 mins which would probably take about 10gb of memory. The front camera is also pretty decent. Coming to the os its one of the best i have used and all the apps function very very smoothly. If you are planning to go for iphone in the same range i would recommend to go for oneplus 7 pro since its a much better buy.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is one heck of a phone.What's Good:Awesome DisplayAwesome CameraAwesome warp ChargingI was a iphone user and recently decided to give OnePlus a Shot.It won't let you down, Got for it.One to One, I'll say its even better than Iphone. Plus you got so much user control when you use android, everything is so restricted in iphone.Loved this Phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  One Plus Genuinely Could have worked on the camera picture quality . It's Just mediocre. The Phone is a beast when it comes to Gaming and it doesn't heat up. Battery life is Good considering it's a performance based fone. Overall not satisfied with the pricing but happy with the performance\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The best thing about this phone is the screen and battery life. Hands down the phone lasts for a full day with heavy screen on time and could last a day n half or even two with little usage. However, the camera is a big disappointment for me who is coming from Google pixel phone. Also, for the features and quality of this phone, I believe it could have been priced between 35-40k and not more.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Awesome handset so far. I have not faced any issue. The only thing I have to mention is the connectors missing from the box. C-Type to 3.5mm should have been given in box along with hands free. Anyways that is what I think may be most of them dont think that way.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  1. My new One Plus 7 Pro delivered yesterday. But could not be able to set up as Android closes frequently. Tried several times after switch off/on. (Photo of error message enclosed)Contacted Amazon technical team, but response unsatisfactory.  Replacement ordered yesterday evening itself. No response till now.2.  My earlier One Plus 6, after software  updating to ver. 10 , the BSNL 3G/4G sim is working for call and SMS only, but no data service. Went to BSNL and checked. Sim works with other mobile , but not with my OP 6(after updating). APN setting show blank. They says problem with mobile/software.Any solutions?\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I upgraded it from One plus 6. It's just a perfect phone in all aspects. Every spec including hardware and software is awesome. Display,design,camera , sound everything meet my expectations.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Everything ok excellent feel , finger print sensor not at good as per this phone standard... doesn't work properly. Again and its show mismatch. Getting irritated. With this high cost, their is No head set , no c type connecter to 3.5 audio Jack. The packaging is very very worst.. no bubble wrap , outside box got damage. Really disappointed\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Best phone. Everything is good. There is no place to say bad. I love it. I use 17day running..\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Received the product today. Absolutely mind blowing. Battery back up, display, camera etc everything is perfect. If budget is not a concern then can go for it. Thanks to Amazon for an perfect delivery.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Camera quality is not that good , fingerprint reader doesn't work properly\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The phone comes with lots of exciting features. Will update about pros qnd cons after 1 month.The beauty about the phone is it's screen and camera. The photo was clicked on portrait mode.Please note, the box doesn't contains usb type c to 3.5 mm headphone adapter.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Product sturdy, neat, premium finishWorth the valueSpeed blinding fast won't feel the lagDisplay is next level with 90hz refresh rate colours are very vibrantVibration feedback powerfulSound loud enough for a roomProcessing power no lag no matter how many apps running in background\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Speed and 90 Hz UHD Display is all about this phone. One you use 90 Hz buttery smooth display, it is almost impossible to go backward in 60 Hz. Camara Quality is as usual pretty normal in all one plus phone. It will not justify the price tag. Portrait mode is worst. Only good thing in Camara is Night Mode. Performance and Display are outstanding. Haptic feedback and Dual Sterio Speaker also good.UFS 3.0 Fast storage is also USP for this phone as no other phone have. Not for a Camara beast. Good who is looking for 90Hz smooth display and fast performance.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Most amazing phone I have ever used ..got hands on this yesterday...the smooth touch and the mirror screen is awesome..I would recommend to buy this ...OnePlus is doing a really great job ..hats off to the phone and technology ..worth the price..\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  What an amazing premium phone, the colour, the build quality, the big curve screen, the speed, battery everything is perfect. I am a oneplus fan. I have been using oneplus 2, oneplus 3 and now directly jumped into 7pro and the oneplus 3 is still running smoothly. Its undoubtedly the flagship killer at this price.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  No doubt at present it's the best phone available in the world. At first I thought it's a bit costly but after using it for a month take my word it's worth every penny.I will not mention the features as we all know it, but it's really super fast, the touch is excellent, display has no match and it is super smooth, battery can easily last for full day even with heavy use and the wrap charger fulls it very quickly. Finger print reader has no match, it has great camera with some great features, very good quality even in low light. Friends Oneplus 7pro really is a great Masterpiece by Oneplus.Those making mind to buy but are a little doubtful........ take my word, buy it with closed eyes, you will Love it. Thanks Amazon for 2 day delivery.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Am cutting one star for not having any headphone jack also the OnePlus wireless earphones are too high.Regarding other performance so far so good you can go for it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Like:1. Superb screen. It's incredible. Maybe the best that I have seen on a mobile device.2. Great battery life and charging speeds for such a power house.Dislike:1. The camera is really really bad for the hype they created.2. Can't stress enough, camera is sub-par. Especially when you take pictures from third party apps in low light.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  OnePlus forgot it's customer first policy, also quality of OnePlus 7 and onwards series are not upto the mark.Their is no premium quality left and the brand is now into mass production of low grade device and supplying in India.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Simply the best deal in the Android world right now. Stupendously quick and delightful performance! Forget all the reviews saying average battery life, I get 7 hours with 90 hz, qhd+, wifi and location on all the time.Love the nebula blue gradient. And the screen, o my god! What a treat.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I don't know why I'm seeing so many negative reviews, personally, I haven't seen any issues so far from past 1 week of usage.The camera is not up to the mark but I hope future updates will solve this. Every product has its pros and cons.Hope one plus solves the issues related to the camera.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  hi ,Pros:Displaycons:Less battery life , can't take fast pics coz three cameras but good picsBit heavy phonehmmm immersive display so pro of display will rule off restSo don't think much i have thought too much  for 4 months and bought finally but it's worth it guysAs compared with samsung s6 and this is better\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  just not able to finish the setup process and its heating like crazy.Didnt expect this from OnePlus7 Pro, its highly frustrating\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have been a loyal customer of One Plus.... but the problem I am facing with this phone is that there is no option for cellular/data back up of photos in the backup &Sync section. It only says waiting for wifi. I am clueless what to do about it. This option was clearly available in my previous One Plus phone.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The phone is awesome after around two updates the camera quality goes better and the fingerprint reader is accurate and fast.Display is awesome and crisp colours are observed. Battery life at first will be somewhat less but as phone adjusts to the usage, the battery life will go up.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  A great device with great specs.The display is simply great and now I don't feel like using any other device after using this display.Oxygen OS is fantastic.Warp Charge is very Handy.The camera is also great, although a bit confusing in some aspects.Now runs on Android 10.I couldn't ask for anything more.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Every thing is good with this machine, it works too fast ... That is unbelievably quick ..... Moving to camera  it is not top notch but you can get good pictures with it ...other than that it is an awesome phone I am experiencing for th 4 th month and to this day it hasn't disappointed me . Kudos to you ..., It's edge screen is an eye catching feature that people will admire.Ps: I was using galaxy grand duos and switched to this just this year and everything in it is worth the money\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is my first one plus device and I am quite impressed with the quality of the phone, however I faced an issue where the camera app kept crashing for which I rebotted the device and the issue got solved. I hope that is just a temporary glitch. The portrait mode works only in telephoto mode and is quite annoying for indoor photography. Hope we get a software update for this. battery charging is very fast and last for a day very comfortably.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  No water resistant, but product pdf says water resistant to some extent by this they making us tempt to buy. But finaly dening warranty for water issues.Don' t buy this, oneplus and amazon won't help, all of them simply cheating customers.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Don't go by the media uplift of the product. It's not worth the money. Still need a lot of software updation, new issues are arising as one is getting solved. Camera is not so great as they say. But looks good & feels good too so if you don't care about small issues then go for it who am I to stop you?\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Well it's one of the best phones out there period.Now it's a great time to buy this phone and it's a good choice too cuz it's prize has gone down a lot. I had a phone to exchange it with so I got it for around 35k which was a steal.of a deal for me.

I have the 12gb RAM with 256gb memory variant. Has zero glitches while running CPU intensive apps. The selfie camera mechanism is quite sturdy and safe. All in all, whatever OnePlus claims for this phone is true. The only con is that it doesn't come with a type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter/ converter.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Its a beast interms of performance. Oxygen OS is as smooth as always and its get better and better day by day. Updates are always on time. Interms of camera it's good but not the best as compared to the competition.

Otherwise it deliverd as promised. Initially it fails 2-3 time during initial setup due to software glitch but hard-reboot helped to restore the error. The mobile is a charm.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The only thing I resent about this phone is the exclusion of the headphone adapter/dongle in the box. Oh and the cheap quality tpu case that comes with it.

You can get more details in YouTube. 5 out of 5 stars.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This mobile phone is awesome in this series.

Definitely not a quality buy.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Really very fluid experience. 90 Hz refresh rate really makes everything look much smoother. The battery life is great. Fingerprint sensor is a bit slow, but the whole screen without any notch and a 90 Hz display combined with very less Bezels makes it the best value for money on the market.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This was the immediate response:Fingerprint sensor could have been better. Battery life is awesome. Display is again a thumbs up. Earphones absence in the box had let me down. But over a good phone, may little over priced I felt.After 11 months usage:Definitely not worth the money. It's only a spec sheet phone. It hangs a lot. I have gone service center almost 5 times. And their services is again not customer centric. Phone still hangs often. It gets heated up like hell. Sometimes I can't hold it, it gets that hot while charging or sometimes when I play games.

But its a bit big, afterall 6.7 inches is quite a number and super slippery if used without the case.And I am awestruck by the speed it charges. üòç\\n\\n \\n\\n  Worth every buck.Finally one plus has involved and presented a better shaped handset.- Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.- Best in class camera.- Better battery life and charging.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Waste of money this time one plus 7 pro heavy weight not disply gud compare to samsung, also inbuilt screen guard getting with bubles and in youtube show wireless headphone and 2 axtra cover with phone but not recived this time really waste of money\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone has a hanging issue. Nd ur customer care says they can send d technician on 25th. Its like  i hv spent 53000 nd still i cant use a phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  No 4G direct video call!! What a mess! Clearly over priced. Display is stunning. Performance stunning. Average battery backup. Over hiped device as usual!! Worst RAM management! Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.\\n\\n \\n\\n  just bought oneplus 7 prowas exploring itsaved both of my thumbs as fingerprint but the phone opened with my right index fingerprintwhat the hell is this\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am giving 1 star for poor camera quality .The camera is bad than my oneplus 3.Its not able to focus correctly and the final image is blurry.I discovered the issue when clicking a pic of a document.The text was not sharp and all and after doing some more testing with 3rd party apps , and going thru Oneplus Forum, found that many people are facing this same issue.Oneplus should fix this issue, else this would be like OP 2\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is a beast of a phone. Fastest processor amongst Android phones. Full screen AMOLED display takes the viewing experience to another level. Stereo speakers quality is too good. Can\\'t ask for a better phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I got the Phone Yesterday. And from my 1 Day experience I\\'m giving you short review.. I won\\'t go for the things It doesn\\'t have.. I\\'ll tell, how it works with the Things it have..1. Oh Boy, the Display, It\\'s Smooth as Butter.. I think it\\'s the best thing of this Phone.. You can use it all day and It\\'s really really Awesome. No Display and I say No Display is Smooth and Vivid as This One...2. Speed! 90Hz Display and SD 855 show it\\'s Muscle here.. From app opening to Gaming, it does everything smoothly!3. Build Quality is Great. It feels Solid. No way it\\'s A One Handed Device. Slightly Heavier Side.4. Warp Charge!! Yesterday at Night 11.30 pm I started Charging with 11% Battery. Within 12.35 am it\\'s 100%. It\\'s Blazing Fast.Now Let\\'s Talk about some Mediocre Stuff-4. Camera! It\\'s Ok I\\'d say.. Colour is slightly shifted.. I don\\'t know Why but My Poco is Capturing Better image than this in Automatic Mode.. It\\'s Good and like traditional One Plus Camera.. The Only Weakness!! Front Camera is good but nothing Mind-blowing Crazy..  It tends to Crop too much in Front Camera Portrait Shots.I hope One Plus implement Wide Angle Video Recording..All I can say, It\\'s Good Phone for 52K.. Value for Money.. But Market will be Competitive in May with Asus and Redmi New Launch. So if you can, Wait for 1 Month and Compare with Other Things.But If for Display, I will Choose this Phone Anyday over Upcoming Ones.. It\\'s Best.... I think till Samsung Note 10, the One Plus Display will be Champion in Market.I didn\\'t talk about 3.0 UFS storage cause everyday usage you won\\'t see much difference.And Sorry for my Poor English!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality is almost same as 6T, which is worst, utterly flopped popup cameraDisplay of dark cell is very bad, M30 is much better than thisI don\\'t know about this ram, without optimizing software, more power consumption which leads battery drains fast over multi tasking and produces heat.Finally oneplus is no more for mid range premium customers. 10k higher\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality is not up to mark as per price range. There is Slow motion video recordering blanking problem. Picture clearly of 3 camera is poor. Avoid to Buy this Product.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Phone is awesome but c connector for 3.5jack  not provided in box however in 6T they provide that same 7 pro is upgraded and high rate phone they should provide that same ! Really unhappy üòî with OnePlus first time I purchased one plus phone and my expectations not meet !\\n\\n \\n\\n  After using 36 hrs am writing this review.Screen,sound ,build quality are just awesome.I found only few Cons. like-1.battery back up2. No type-C to 3.5 jack in box where it was available with 6T model.3. No headphone/earphone in box.after paying 48999 u can expect a pair of headphone\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s Bulky in handit\\'s not charging fast as they claiming 48% in 20 minsAnd it\\'s get unusual temperature risedEar phone missed bcz now a day\\'s all premium phone s will get good quality ear phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  phone is ok ..but battery drain very fast..Photo is good...the person who use more incoming and outgoing calls... This phone is not advisable.. then u carry Power bank or charger...1plus 6 is good , when you camper..Only for photo purpose is ok...I am really unhappy about charging point...after 4/months. This problem is coming.. charging is very slow... Not advisable.. I want return the product ... Charger is not locking inside...Wast of money.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I do not recieve Bluetooth earphone and car charger  in YouTube one plus 7 pro unboxing show Bluetooth earphone and car charger but i only receive phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am using this product since 2 week and I\\'m impressed with the product in all the way.Thank you one plus.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Display problem. After bought within one week\\n\\n \\n\\n  *SUPER ATTRACTIVE DISION*BOTH CAMERAS ARE SUPER*BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD*DELIVERY IS TOO LATE*BUT 1+  GIVE NO AUDIO JACK . THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTED FOR ME*AUDIO QUALITY IS SUPER\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very first 30 minutes of using the mobile phone (Unboxed it), It started heating up, temperature went up to 43 Degrees,Battery started draining, GPS didn\\'t pick the location. Later fingerprint sensor was responding... I have to use the phone pin to unblock.Even visited the service center in Banjara Hills, And they told me to recreate the scene, Due to heat I have switch off the device, Fear of It might explode. Later they said to use for another day and visit again. Device still heating up.. same issues, Didn\\'t expect this from a flagship phone with a heavy price....Contacting amazon to return the device\\n\\n \\n\\n  \"FLAGSHIP KILLER TO FLAGSHIP\"UPDATE: Editing the review after using for more than 6 months, haven\\'t faced any performance issue so far. Performance is top notch till date & now same device getting sold at 10k discount, so it\\'s good buy.----------------------------Planning to buy OnePlus 7 Pro? Here\\'s all in one review:Bought OnePlus 7 Pro in first sale, now using it from few days.Yeah! OnePlus 7 Pro priced little high.PRO\\'S:- OnePlus 7 Pro\\'s DISPLAY looks damn beautiful üòç with 6.67 inch OLED fluid Amoled 1440p display which has 90 Hz refresh rate.- It comes with pre-applied screen protector.- In display fingerprint sensor is faster than OnePlus 6T.- Warp charger charges very fast, from 0-50 in just 20 minutes.- In Fanatic mode, games can be played butter smooth.- Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.- Cam2api enabled.- Snapdragon 855 gives best performance.- Oxygen OS is BEAST, smooth, bloatware & ad-free, lag free.- UFS 3.0 helps to improve performance.CON\\'S:- Though, display looks beautiful with 90 Hz refresh rate, but because of that battery drains much faster, as result give Screen on time 4-5 hours. You can change it to 60 Hz to save battery.- Overpriced.- Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can\\'t even focus on near objects.- Device is heavy.- No IP rating, but according to few, it survives in water as well, but not tested personally üòõ.- No wireless charging.- No headphone.FINAL VERDICT:- If OnePlus 7 Pro satisfies your requirement, buy it though it\\'s little bit overpriced but still worth it.- If not 7 Pro, Samsung S10+ is also great choice.- Otherwise, if looking for low price phone, Flagship Killer 2.0 coming soon üòúNote: I\\'ll update review, after using for few days.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0On the first day I am facing issue in setting and it\\'s not opening having issue in WiFi connectivity...any more issue...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Good phone. But after paying 52k we expect least a headphones. Ggwp OnePlus. On YouTube while unboxing. They get Bluetooth headphones, car charger, 3 different covers. Really disappointed when I found no headphone in 7pro 8gb RAM 256gb ROM\\n\\n \\n\\n  First of all i am a die hard fan of one plus.I have one plus 5t one plus 6t and now a one plus 7 pro.Seriously very disappointed with the camera.Before one plus i was a mi fan.I have redmi note 3 and note 7.Selfie camera comparison of op 7 n redmi note 7.Redmi note 7 selfie camera is for better than op 7 pro.Op7 pro selfie camera shows ur face like a skin disease patient.Where as op5t and op6t had no issues like this.For this price range op should have included wireless charging.Waiting for a better camera update.\\n\\n \\n\\n  What a gem of a smart device! Absolutely incredible.Bit heavy, and SD 855 keeps rolling as it reduces battery drainage unbelievably, i didn\\'t expect that.And look at the price, Oh ho man...! it helps us saving atleast 20k, you know what i mean...üòâ\\n\\n \\n\\n  I generally use Apple iphone but this time I tried something different. I completely disappointed by using Oneplus 7 pro camera .iPhone 6 camera is more better than this. OIS and EIS is not working properly. There are so many UI issues as well in Oxygen OS.Phone is quite Bulky and not able to handle by using single hand. I wasted 53k to buy this phone. I never buy any product of OnePlus in future.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Heating as hell, poor battery backup. Camera is not good. And it\\'s heavy. Don\\'t feel effect of Dolby Atmos.Pro- just it\\'s screen.I will update after further usage.Update after 1 week, heating issue gone. Facing WhatsApp and YouTube application\\'s frequent crash. Camera quality is still an issue, it\\'s good but not up to the mark of flagship.Update- pro-1. fingerprint sensor + face unlock is fast.2. night camera is really good3. video recording is stable.con-1. During calls there is a whistling sound.2. sometimes touch is not working properly in whatsapp,vlc, youtube, asphalt 8 etc.3. selfie camera is not upto mark4. phone is hanging after first update.\\n\\n \\n\\n  An absolute fun loving futuristic Beast phone ever made by OnePlus.Thumbs Upüëç:1. Fluid Amoled: Top notch quality display similar to Samsung Dynamic Amoled.2. 90Hz Refresh rate: Butter Smooth experience, Best for gaming! üé≥3. Full screen Display:  There is no distractions like notch or pinch hole camera. Breathtaking üòç Viewing experience with HDR10+.üì∫4. Triple Camera Setup: Ultra wide(117¬∞)+ Wide + Telephoto.üé•5. Dolby Atmos: Crystal clear Surround sound üîä6. Popup Camera: Interesting Camera üì∑set up which eliminated notch on Display and it is sturdy.7. World\\'s First phone to have UFS 3.0.Thumbs Down:üëé1: I felt like screen is too big, it could have been between 6.3 - 6.4 instead of 6.67 inch.2.  Price: I had to pay Rs.16000üí∞ more Just for full screen Display (UHD+, 90Hz+ Bezelless), 300mAh more battery and for an Extra Telephoto camera.3. Little bit thicker & hefty: 206gramsüèãÔ∏è compared to OnePlus7 weighing about 182grams.Will update my detailed review on OnePlus 7pro after One Month of usage.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I completely Loved the display quality , sound quality , finger print sensor , Pop up camera, wide angle , 3x zoom and night scape camera. I disappointed a bit by not having a 3.5 mm ear phone jack. Coming to the story of battery life one plus 7 pro is 4000 milliamp which is having 9 hrs 45 minutes battery life where as one plus 6t is 3700 milliamp which is having 10 hrs battery life . I was disappointed with this too. I was totally stunned by the speediness of fingerprint sensor absolutely stunned .  I think everything is fine with the New one plus 7 pro and I am absolutely and delightfully enjoying the experience of New one plus 7 pro . Basically I am a movie lover. I am enjoying the HD movies like I am watching in movie theater. Dolby Atmos sound quality adds this phone to become high priority than others .\\n\\n \\n\\n  Definitely worth every single Penny spent on it. The display and performance are absolutely mind blowing. Camera may not be the best but it\\'s still top class. The phone isn\\'t as big as people would think it is. It\\'s actually pretty sleek and feels nice in the hands as it isn\\'t very broad. The battery performance is commendable given the 90hz refresh rate and the QHD display. Would easily last a day on normal usage. Although, Heavy users would require around half an hour of charging. Warp charge is super fast, you won\\'t even realise how quickly your phone charges after you plug it in. Oxygen works buttery smooth and as a first time user of this UI, I\\'m liking it quite a lot. Gaming is wonderful too, absolutely smooth, beautiful and lag free. The accompanying phone cover is good too, it just gets smudged by finger prints though. As someone who watched reviews of different phones and was well versed with what I was buying, I\\'m enjoying every second of using this phone.Most of the reviewers here are complaining about not receiving headphones and extra covers and a screen guard with bubbles, it\\'s absolutely absurd. You should atleast look over what you\\'re buying first thoroughly, and any reasonable man would have easily found out what he\\'s get in the box and what he\\'s not getting. These illiterate people buy stuff without knowing anything and then expect candies in the damn box and when they don\\'t get it, write negative reviews which influence other queer buyers. It\\'s highly unfortunate.For all those looking for the best performing Device available right now, go for it, if you can compromise with the headphone jack (get a 3.5mm to c type cable and problem solved). Everything from the looks and feel to the performance of the phone is amazing. You\\'ll feel that you\\'re holding a flagship masterpiece every second you\\'re holding this phone. It\\'s easily the best phone in it\\'s price range hands down.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Battery is a weak.. Needs to charge twice a dayAnd apps also keep crashing... In between...Thr is a bug in which lock screen ambient light won\\'t work sumtimes\\n\\n \\n\\n  Didn\\'t received Bluetooth headphone and car charger with mobile. As it was told in the launch event that one plus seven will give both these products with package.\\n\\n \\n\\n  SO this phone is probably the best Android phone till date and even better than ios ehen it comes to camera and speed‚ù§Ô∏èI HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST 2 DAYS FOLLOWING ARE THE PROS-1)NO LAG IN GAMING2) ULTIMATELY FAST CHARGING3) THE EDGES ON SCREEN GIVE PREMIUM FEELING4) DUAL SPEAKERS ARE SERIOUSLY USEFUL5) THE TOUCH AND DISPLAY IS VERY SMOOTH6) CAMERA IS A BEAST BOTH FRONT AND BACK CAMERAFOLLOWING ARE CONS-NONE XD AS A CONCLUSION--THE SPEED IS UNMATCHABLE-IN HAND FEEL IS VERY PREMIUM-CAMERA WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN-WARP CHARGING IS VERY QUICKHOPE THIS HELPSüôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è\\n\\n \\n\\n  Neither a flagship phone nor a flagship killer. It\\'s an expensive joke..  Mi note 5 pro camera is far far better than this idot box.  48 MP camera is a joke.  The tech reviewers gave biased reviews. Don\\'t even try to compare with MI note 7 pro 48MP setup.  Nothing in the product will amaze you,  you will end up with a huge disappointment... Ram management is pathetic,  battery is below average.  Go for google pixel rather than this.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I didn\\'t believe the reviewers. I bought the phone. And now I don\\'t like any other phones except OnePlus 7 Pro.90Hz - It\\'s madness. Imagine this - Drinking alcohol is injurious to health, but if you drink it you\\'ll feel good. Right? 90Hz would give you the best smartphone experience, but it drains some more battery compared to 60Hz. Moderate drinking is perfectly fine; charging the phone 2 times a day is fine too. (I\\'m a heavy user)Warp charger - Charges the phone at remarkable speeds. If you\\'re a previous OnePlus user, you won\\'t find much of a difference.Camera - Definitely the best, in accordance with pricing.Everything else - as accurate as in the product description.My favorite retarded reviews :*Someone was upset that he couldn\\'t find a \\'OnePlus backpack\\' and a \\'OnePlus water bottle\\' in the package.*Someone was upset that he found an air bubble under the phone\\'s screen guard.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was a follower of OnePlus but after this phone I am not going to by OnePlus phones anymore. I got screen burning on multiple spots on this phone.Those people call it a gaming phone & when I play games for couple of hours a day it gets screen burning....so what kind of gaming phone is this.I bought Samsung Tab S6 for gaming....this phone just remain as yet another phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  Big issue with touchscreen..when I try n write it starts video call on wattsapp.. I am trying to write a review the page is closing automatically. After spending 50k if you face such issues, it\\'s disappointing.. I don\\'t know if this issue is because I ordered from Amazon.. I will not recommend this phone to anyone.. I want to return this n want a good phone in working condition or else my refund.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very disappointed with the product performance and battery life. It\\'s taking more than an hour for full charge in switch off mode and also drains of in just 8 hours. The very new phone started hanging. Is this is what expected from one plus. I need a replace for this phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was waiting for this now when i have this in my hands it\\'s just awesome, super design, perfect camera like all models of one plus.A phone from flagship killer to flagship.If anyone really looking to have feel of premium phone then go for it.It\\'s been two days i am using this phone and all good till now, battery, display, speed, sound everything is perfect.\\n\\n \\n\\n  OnePlus 7pro the best mobile iam using more than 20 mobiles but this mobile is great performance camera performance is the best screen quality is very impressive thanks OnePlus and Amazon ones again\\n\\n \\n\\n  Touch is not working properly\\n\\n \\n\\n  Bought on 17th May, worked well for a week, since last 2 days ph not functioning properly, getting hanged. irratic response at time. Can\\'t pick up call , apps switching automatically.Never believe this can happen with  such a brand and such high end Mobile.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality is normal,Mobile is more weighted in hands,suddenly my call log didn\\'t work properly,night mode does not looks best as well with slowmotion video in low light is worst.battery is better and also the wrap charger doesn\\'t give us wow experience of we are already using dash chargers. Sound is awesome with dual output speakers top and bottom,Mobile finger print sensor is jaw dropping faster.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Upgraded from my OnePlus 6 just a few days back after using OnePlus 6 for about 10 months or so.Initial observation :1. QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. No notch whatsoever.3. Near Stock Android experience.4. OP is great in pushing updates regularly which is a rare thing even with Samsung\\'s flagship phones.Pro\\'s :1.  QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Near Stock Android experience with some very useful features like screen recorder, ability to switch between QHD & FHD+, etc3. Fast Charging (coutsey OPPO\\'s VOOC Charge 3).4. Good ROM options.5. ZEN mode to log you out of the smartphone for 20 minutes.6. Full screen without a notch makes video streaming a great experience.7. Apps open fast, really fast.8. Pop Up camera is really fast during face recognition. Many times you may not even notice that the POP UP camera really came out of the slot retracted. It\\'s that fast.CON\\'s :1. Battery drain gets hampered if you run it in QHD with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Camera is not up to the mark as compared to OnePlus 6 apart from the options of wide angle. (maybe software update will improve its usability, perticularly while shooting videos in wide angle).3 Camera clicks 12 MP shots in default mode. Night mode is so-so but don\\'t compare it with Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL or even with Pixel 3a XL. Pixel is way ahead in terms of resolution perticularly in night mode.4. Day time photos are much better when compared to OnePlus 6 perticularly where good light is not an issue. Photography during \"conference\" might be tricky. This is where Pixel will overshadow all other smartphones.5. This is a big phone in the territory of a tablet. Handling it might be a bit difficult for some. Single hand use is not advisable.Will update after a few more days of use.UPDATE AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF USAGE :Most of the users of OnePlus 7 Pro (as per the reviews) would be happy with budget handset like Redmi or Realme as they are either using OnePlus 7 Pro for the sake of it or to play games. Whether your handset has 2GB RAM free or not has nothing to do with the performance. What makes a difference is the availability of RAM for a perticular task. RAM management is very good like all the previous OnePlus devices.IPhone XS Max also doesn\\'t give a headset or even a dongle to use it with 3.5 mm headphone jack but people do buy iPhone without thinking twice. Iphone doesn\\'t even give fast charging brick in the box. When people can spend a lack of rupees for a brand why complain about OnePlus 7 Pro.Call quality of OP 7 Pro is good. Even video calling over Whatsapp and Skype is good.It\\'s a pleasure using OnePlus 7 Pro for creating Word documents, PPT\\'s, Excel Sheets on the go. These apps use a lot of battery and RAM. Adobe Reader is just fluid. RAM management while using these apps and switching between them is just beautiful and seamless.Will update after a few more days......As expected, OnePlus released an update on the general performance and camera issue.Camera quality is quite subjective and uncontrollable since everyone can capture an awful photo in a random scenario. Even though the photo is not quite bad technically, there is always someone giving negative opinion only for the reason that he likes more appealing photo style. Every time when there is a photo sent to us due to negative feedback, our engineers are requested to find the same light condition and object of same color and texture to simulate the photo in order to reproduce the same problem. You can imagine the time and workload needed for fixing every single problem, not to mention the dozens of photos we got from all over the world everyday. We hope you guys could understand and allow us more time keep working on the camera.ONEPLUS COMMUNITY LISTENS....\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality is awful. Not worth buying. Can\\'t even return the product\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have tried twice to explain what issues I am facing with this phone but the Amazon call centre are not accepting it. They are just trying to ignore the issues. I want the phone to be replaced at any cost. Other phones which is 7 pro itself which is being charged in 30 mins and my phone is taking more then an hour to charge the phone. batter draines like a China Redmi phone. I am using 5T OnePlus which is getting fast charging then this pro phone and battery is not drained at all. This phone gets more then an hour plus the phone is getting HEATED ALOT WHILE CHARGING AND WHILE THE BATTERY BEING USED IN APPLICATION LIKE WHATSAPP. BATTERY GETS BADLY DRAINED AND ITS ALSO GETTING HEATED UP WHILE USING APPLICATION. THE APPLICATION WHICH AMAZON ASKED ME TO INSTALL I INSTALLED AND I SAW ITS RATING ON PLAYSTORE. PEOPLE ARE YELLING ON THE APPLICATION WHICH IS BEING USED TO CHECK THE PHONE the BLANCCO. I am seriously not interested in using this phone. REFUND ME MY MONEY BACK OR ELSE SEND A NEW PHONE TO ME. AMAZON PEOPLE ARE FOOLISHLY TELLING ME TO USE THE PHONE ON POWER SAVING MODE. I AM NOT AT ALL A FOOL TO SPEND 53000 FOR SUCH HEATED UP PHONE. REPLACE THE PHONE OR ELSE GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. I AM WRITING THIS WITHIN THE PERIOD TO REPLACEMENT AND I HAVE TRIED THE CALL CENTRE TWICE. REPLACE ME THE PHONE WITH NEW ONE OR ELSE SEND ME MY MONEY BACK.\\n\\n \\n\\n  OnePlus 6T was among the fastest Android ever and this time OnePlus has truly gone beyond speed to make one of the best phones of 2019.Pros-1. Display. The major pro is the damn smooth 90 Hz refresh rate along with QHD+ screen. It\\'s as smooth as a butter!2. Ram Boost - The phone learns your behaviour like which apps you use most and accordingly allocates ram towards it making the phone even faster.3. Speed. Nothing to say about this. It\\'s blazing fast.4. Warp charging. The phone gets charged upto 50% in about half an hour and completely in about 75 minutes.5. Completely stoked with the battery after a heavy usage of 9.5 hour screen time with playing games for 2 hours and using Netflix for 7 hours in a single charge.Cons-1. Including camera here for the time being until a major update comes our and improves the camera firmware. As of now, not a flagship camera by miles.2. Lack of IP rating, not that it matters to me. The phone\\'s tested enough in water.3. Lack of wireless charging. Again, not felt as a con because of warp charging, but still.Conclusion: If you can wait for a while for the camera to be improved and don\\'t mind the above cons, definitely go for it. Nebula Blue is a beauty!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Macro mode ?\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa01) No wireless headset provided,2) Very poor slow motion recording.it keeps on flickering even after recording.No support from Amazon team.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Overall it\\'s a average mobile,, not any special than 6t. I have got a damaged piece.. never expected this from amazon\\n\\n \\n\\n  There is no filter option in camera, even camera quality is really bad, night light camera is disaster. Phone speed is fine, battery not that strong.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Worst phone not worth buying. Very bad launched by OnePlus..... Facing ghost issues and Amazon not taking it bay\\n\\n \\n\\n  Slightly heavy to carry.. great buy with top of the line specifications.. excellent camera.. found it a bit slower than one plus 6 I used... perhaps improve with updates and AI..\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is great in terms of speed and smoothness but there is no headphone with the phone.- not even an adapter to use my old earphoneAfter spending 50K,I am unable to listen music with my phoneScreen and touch is awesomeSpeed is fastCamera is superbSound quality is good on speakerThere is little problem to listen directly from phone during call as there is full screen instead of earphoneIn this price range we expect it to be bit more - at least a decent earphone should have been added\\n\\n \\n\\n  First of all i would like to thank Amazon for delivering the product right on time 5 out of 5.Now coming to the phone - This one is a beauty and the beast all together.Display - 10 out of 10Software - 9/10Build - 9/10Battery - 8/10Camera- 9/10Gaming - 10/10Premiumness - 10/10Value for money - 8/10The best flagship right now in the market.Now what i didn\\'t like1. No earphones provided bcos for 50k phone earphones should y provided.2. A rugged protective case would have been welcome3. No type C converter provided.4. Battery life is average but fast charger makes life easy.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Screen is good. Camera is just ok. Fingerprint scanner is bad. Heating too much. No earphone, no 3.5 adaptor. Overall waste of money. Can\\'t expect such bad performance from one plus. They have started cheating customers. This is not at all a flagship phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  My wait for this phone is finally over. Received the phone in good condition. OnePlus7 pro has a Beautiful large screen resolution, great camera and incredible processor speed... Also a bigger battery backup with warp charge.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Dear Mr Bezos,I am writing this in grief that the product which I received is malfunction and I tried to return this product on day 2 of me buying it , but as per your amazon policy money was not refundable . Is it good to take people hard earned money and become rich with all this schemes , before amazon was never like this . You can check call records even I have contacted your company executives not once but twice. Days passed and it the 16th day of this phone the phone has an issue as when I using an app like watsapp while texting it opens the profile of the person whom I am texting , plus it opens up the the other app . I don\\'t know what problem is this . I urged your executive even that mamm I don\\'t require the money , I would be ordering iPhone XR but then also she said a clear no . Experience WD one plus flagship phone is getting pathetic with every passing day.Regards,A genuine customer who has been using Amazon to buy online product always but this experience made me felt disgusted and pathetic.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have received a handset with a faulty mic, as soon as i m on call the person on the other hand seems to have disturbance in the voice call this happen when i m on mic as soonnas i switch to speakers it vanishes and everything works fine but the thing is i have purcahsed a phone to make a normal call not speaker call. I have been to the service store they said take the back up of the phone and hand over to us. It means that ordering the device early is stupidity. Now it can happen they will open the phone and the water proof pressure will be damaged, not happy at all.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got my hands on the first prime day sale and arrived two days later.This phone is a fresh breath of air the. The OS is silky smooth  and no lag whatsoever . One plus did an excellent job with their oxygen OS with great optimization . The 90 Hz display makes the experience much more better . You can change it to typical 60 Hz for a long lasting battery hours but who cares when you have a 90hz display. Browsing and scrolling is super smooth and playing games is a bliss thanks to the snapdragon 855 SoC . Been using it for the past two days and the battery life is good . Gets you throughout the day without excessive game play sessions and the latest UFS 3.0 provides blazing fast data transfer.  I get an average of 8 hr of screen on time with full charge and speaking of charging the latest warp charge charges the device from 40 to 100 in around 25 minutes which is fast. I am happy with the device as it is my first one plus device . Looking forward to using it for more than 2 years.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first ever Android phone, after being an iPhone user for over a decade. The device is superb and fast. Apps work like breeze and overall, Oxygen OS feels clean and fast like iOS. There are several stability issues that I\\'ve seen. Most notably, things like the fingerprint scanner do not always work as expected, the double tap feature doesn\\'t always work and the curvature of the screen leads to unwanted taps. The 48Mp camera is pretty good indeed however, I\\'ve noticed an occasional focusing issue that prevents the camera from focussing correctly under certain conditions.But I guess Android phones are never perfect simply because their software is not particularly built for the hardware. So, I\\'m pretty cool with these issues so far, unless something escalates further. Overall, I\\'m very impressed by the device. Its well built, charges quickly, takes good photos, sounds well and performs well.What I\\'m more interested in seeing are these minor glitches go away with OTA updates as is popular in the OnePlus community. Apple has never been very responsive to minor complaints and their updates take ages to appear. OnePlus, from what I\\'ve heard is very responsive to customer complaints and I\\'m hoping things become better with upcoming updates.Till then I\\'m finding 1 - 2 star reviews on Amazon really amusing with people reporting things like a missing screen cleaning cloth, wireless headphones. Get a life people, and buy these on your own.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Great choice over S10 Plus.Amazing display and smooth experience with 90Hz refresh rate, which can only be experience while using.Battery gives more than 4 Hours of screen time with 90Hz.Superfast charging with WARP charger.Extremely fast and no log switching between apps and playing games.Outstanding camera which clicks quite decent pics in both day and night.Overall best phone from OnePlus till now. Worth purchase with no cons.\\n\\n \\n\\n  One plus 7 pro is an awesome phone no doubts.I am a very strong Apple fan, still i used 99% apple products.I have iphone too, but openly say compare to one plus 7 pro, i phone is nothing.Superb camera,superb perfomance.8 gb ram and 256 gb storage capacity around 52, 000/-.Both front and back cameras are awesome.Good phone for gaming people also.Good wide display.Good sound quality.Superb design.No doubts this is best phone in market now.One plus have good brand name too.What I dislike is 1.) Little over weight. 2.)Battery life not that much better.(One day average)3)No headphone Jacket or head phone with this phone.All other features are superb, inbuilt call record, app lock etc etc.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Loved itI liked everything in this mobileIt is smooth, fast, powerfulThe latest Oxygen OS.ALL ARE SUPERI liked very much is it\\'s PREMIUM DISPLAY.....You feel yourself as superior.1+ is a brand that no one can beat or at least touch.Some rival companies are saying that flagship killer is coming but I would say you can never beat a Oxygen OS......If you are affordable for this just blindly go for the pro .......Even if you feel it as expensive, gather money & definitely go for this.There are some minor quality issues with cameraBut surely by the time you read this review 1+ would have definitely posted an update and fixed those small thingsüôÇ.........Never compare 1+ with other brands they are not even worth to sit beside 1+.........You definitely get these thoughts like me after having this phone in your hands............Feel free to ask your queries .......\\n\\n \\n\\n  I felt bad only on one thing regarding the delivery of the product..I ordered the product on 16th May in early sale for prime members and it was supposed to be deliver on next day 17th May 2019 before 9 pm. But I recieved the product in Monday 20th May only..it was such a very bad experience with Amazon Becz even though I was a prime customer I recieved the product very late.. I raised many issues and complaints within that date to get the product on time. I felt very bad about the delivery service of Amazon team..Note regarding the beast and flagship of 2K19.. we happy to buy one plus product again. I was already using one plus 6 for the last 8 months. Always the one plus is so fast and good in performance and built quality. The same and with more performance and balanced Battery back up in the new one plus 7 pro. The box itself was awesome. The phone build quality is remarkable. The display is the main highlight of the product such an awesome clarity and movie experience on the phone. The fast movement with 90hz is really awesome. Felt like new whenever I use the phone. Camera quality has been improved a lot. Day time the photos are awesome and the new nightscape is also good .. The front camera is better and fast. Overall I can give 8.5/10 for camera Becz there is still some lag in picture quality and the contrast of colours while taking a picture when compared to other flagship mobiles. Next the most fastest indisplay finger print is speechless.. no lag or no delay even in extreme dark.. happy that the one plus products are always awesome and they are continuously improving the products. The battery was little bit okay for me im getting just 5 hours of screen time only. But I Hope that the upcoming updates will improve the battery life. So I can give 8/10 for battery and 10/10 for performance. The animation is also awesome whenever we open the phone through finger print the live wallpaper is remarkable. Overall I\\'m very much happy to buy this awesome product only I felt little bad about the price and there was no connector for earphones. The price is not too high but I expected little less. Anyways this is the new beast of 2K19. Since I won\\'t be playing that much games so I bought 6gb variant Becz last time I bought 8gb variant it will be even more faster but drains the battery fastly. So I decided to go on with 6gb. I recommend everyone to buy this flagship killer and those who will use the phone for more personal and normal use they can easily go with 6gb variant\\n\\n \\n\\n  A great premium flagship smartphone.Pros:üëâThe DisplayüëâSnappy UI InterfaceüëâOxygen OS (FASTER UPDATES)üëâAn above average camera( can be better with G-cam mod and future updates )üëâVibration hapitc motor feels more premiumConsüëâA bit pricy , but that display !üëâProne to damages can be solved by buying a caseüëâNo wireless charging but you do get a 30W chargerüëâNo ip water resistant although it is water proof check YouTube videos for water tests Op7pro.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Fastest Android phone on Earth!Samsung, Redmi, Apple, etc etc...

Good camera, specially nightmode and normal 4k videos4. Wide amoled screen, superb screen refresh rate, it\\'s becomes a pleasure to watch videos using every mm of the screen since it is notchless5. Oxygen os is just awesome.6. Price - I cannot just praise a phone with these many features and then cry for high price. It is still way cheaper than Samsung Galaxy flagship phonesCons1. Camera in portrait mode isn\\'t that sharp.2. I am not exactly aware of how the liquid cooling system works. Phone got hot a couple of times. But bearable heating.3. The curved screen isn\\'t of any use. So no idea why OP has done this. Though the phone looks premium with it.4. No 3.5 jack. The only genuine complaint I have. I tried hard to find a good quality type c-3.5 mm connector. Otherwise one will always rely on Bluetooth headphones.Overall, a phone worthy of praise and purchase.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Highly over priced\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s a great device I have been using it for a month now... believe me it\\'s completely value for money...it\\'s super snappy buttery smooth...yes it\\'s a little heavier than usual...and battery life is not that good but why complain when u have warp charge it charges you device hell fast...and honestly u will get 24 hours of average battery life...it\\'s great for gaming no heating issue pubg runs at highest graphics...and believe me 90hz refresh rate makes the gaming scrolling supper smooth...the display is great I\\'d say it\\'s one of the best in the business üòÅ...AND PEOPLE U WON\\'T GET EARPHONES AND CAR WARP CHARGER WITH THIS AS SHOWN IN YOUTUBE THOSE ARE CREATOR\\'S BOX THEY ARE ONLY SENT TO BIG CONTENT CREATORS...yes they should have provided a 3.5mm to USB c connector but I bought a OnePlus bullet wired and it\\'s fine u can also buy 3.5mm to USB c convertor from OnePlus official site it costs around 400rs...the fingerprint reader works great..THE CAMERA QUALITY WAS NOT GOOD AT 1ST BUT AFTER 2 UPDATES ITS GREAT...ITS ALSO SPLASH RESISTANT... maximum people are reviewing this after 2-3 days of use but the phone deserves 4 stars....watch YouTube reviewers like MKBHD, Dev2d, unbox therepy...AND OXYGEN OS IS CLOSE TO STOCK ANDROID AND NO BLOATWARE IS LOADED IT WILL WORKTHE SAME SNAPPY AND SMOOTH EVEN AFTER 2-5 YEARS...the pop up camera has free fall detection which is great it closes once the phone slips from your hand...it\\'s has UFS 3.0 storage the first in the world which makes it faster than all the phones and games also load super fast...it also contains first FLUID AMOLED DISPLAY...JUST BUY IT... IT\\'S GREAT PHONE.. THANK YOU\\n\\n \\n\\n  I\\'m using this phone since past 3 days. So, here goes:1. Great display. The curved edges and no-notch display is a great head turner. The large screen makes browsing a great experience.2. Smooth UI. No bloatware whatsoever. No nagging notifications. Very smooth and highly customizable UI.3. Decent Camera. I am not much of a shutterbug. But the snaps I clicked were fantastic. Maybe photography enthusiasts will be able to give a better review on this aspect.4. Nice battery life. Easily lasted 1 and a half day with full charge. And the warp charge is a beaut.5. A little heavy. But we can get used to it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I just upgraded from OnePlus 5tDisplay- the best display on any smartphone!I saw the good reviews on this mobile\\'s display but damn! I didn\\'t expect it to be this good!, I have a S10 in my home for comparison and I can surely say this is as good as Samsung\\'sBuild- I waited for nebula blue and it\\'s worth the wait! It looks awesome, build quality is excellent but a bit hefty but manageable and u will get used to it in one dayCamera- this is the main part, I don\\'t know whether it\\'s due to my low expectations on camera due to all the negativity but I\\'m genuinely surprised with the camera, even for this I compared it with S10 and it\\'s pretty close to S10, low light photography is a major improvement and it\\'s on par with S10 which is considered as best in low light other than HuaweiSo don\\'t believe all the negativity, I wonder people who are putting negative review are using DSLR for their daily photo needs.. the only negative would be the wide angle lens is not upto the mark and the one on S10 is way betterVery happy with the camera..Battery- way better than my 5t and easily getting upto 7hrs of screen on time with moderate to heavy usage and warp charge is the best!Performance- no need to say specially about performance coz it\\'s OnePlus!855 with 90hz display, the fastest phone in the world!Others- call quality excellent, sound output via Bluetooth excellent, fingerprint sensor excellent, vibration feedback excellent, no ip rating but totally waterproof.Overall an excellent package and it\\'s worth the premium price!Important note: 3x telephoto lens will not be active if the object is at less than 50cm distance from the lens and in very low light scenarios in such cases the main sensor is used for zoom for better quality...\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am writing the review after using the product for one week.1. Display & Hardware : That\\'s probably the first thing you\\'ll notice about the phone. There is a massive 6.67-inch screen. (too much for me). The design is rich and lusturous.There is an anti-glare coating at the back which gives a matte-like finish. The all-screen design makes the display amazing. Also, it is the first phone of the brand to offer Quad HD+ Fluid AMOLED panel. And most importantly, the screen is curved on both edges (like recent Samsung flagships).What makes the phone truly stand out is the 90Hz refresh rate. The display is also rated for HDR10+2. Camera : There\\'s a primary 48MP f/1.6 camera backed by an 8MP telephoto lens and 16MP wide-angle shooter.The wide-angle lens offers a 117-degree field of view, and the 8MP telephoto delivers 3x optical zoom. And it is just amazing!! The camera is works amazing in daylight conditions. The night-mode is also good, but don\\'t expect it to compete the Pixel 3 and galaxy S10s. Also, the pop up camera is an amazing addon!!3. Software : You really don\\'t need the review for that.But few good things are- native screen recorder, OxygenOS 9.5, Fnatic Mode and Sen mode.4. Processing : The device is fast, really fast. From face recognition to 90Hz display to OxygenOS\\' clean interface. It is the fastest device I\\'ve ever used. (8/256 Version)5. Battery Life : The OnePlus 7 Pro has a 4000mAh battery, but because of the 90Hz display, I struggled to last it for a day. also, the  Warp Charge delivers a 30W charge. You\\'ll be able to charge from 0-50% in just over 20 minutes, and up to 50% in 30 minutes while gaming.6. Weight : The large screen and the 4000 mAh battery leads to 206g weight. The OnePlus 7 Pro feels too top-heavy, and that makes the device unwieldy.7. Major Cons- too heavy, massive screen, no earphones included (paying 53k, I expected earphones), night mode camera is fairly average, no wireless charging, No IP rating , No 3.5 mm jack.Final verdict - I am postively biased for OnePlus always. But yes, since the price range has moved significantly, the expectations from the device have been significantly increased as well. Still this is one of the most ambitious phones, I\\'ve ever used. So, please go and buy it!.P.S. Personal review!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome premium end deviceNot for everyoneProsDisplay is the standout feature,better than my ipad2018, better than s10 plus at affordable pricePhone is sleekTriple camera just take beautiful picturesFront pop is the next gen camera for full screenCharging is faster than dash charging omgLooks 100/100Must buy good cover phone is slipperyPop camera has free fall detection n works excellentIts a big 6.67 phone not for small hand usersIts touch ,day to day use  is so fast,smooth and responsive thank you once again for your new deviceTrue oneplus fan ,and proud owner of OnePlusCons :Nothing much as of now will update review after monthPhone has outplayed samsung and close to apple but half the price of apple\\n\\n \\n\\n  1st biggest problem- FINGER PRINT SCANNER - my friend can open this phone by using his finger print with registering his fingerprint in this phone ...not even one time..more than 10 times he opened infornt of me...which is unexpected...we are using our finger print for all type of transaction....this type of security glith is not acceptable from oneplus(flagship killer).2nd issue- 90HZ DISPLAY- not worth...display flickers sometime after changing to 90hz...in this 8 days more than 15 times i faced hanging/lagging  issue.3rd issue- AUTO BRIGHTNESS  is not at all working properly.4th issue- this type of CAMERA u can get in 15k phones.5th issue- SCRREN GUARD- After paying 53k ,i didnt expect this type of screen guard...in 2 days,it came out.PHONE IS SO BIG AND HEAVY....53K Iz too much for this type of family.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Amazing phone with lots of improvement over 6t.. definitely a worthy purchase.. also i loved the wide angle camera a lot,although camera needs an improvement..amazing display and 90hz refresh rate is so damn smooth and screen quality is so damn good easily comparable with Samsung s10..overall i loved that feel and smoothness..I Love you one plus.. üíì\\n\\n \\n\\n  24x7 mobile is very hot.cant even hold in handAlso battery dries very fast\\n\\n \\n\\n  The purchase and delivery was excellentNow about product, the camera is awesome, the performance is great..I haven\\'t used any other night end phone like Samsung and iphone to compare this with those. But I like the OnePlus phone so far\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0From day one it gives problems.Hang, from last 3 hours it\\'s showing restarting.Many basic apps crash like google chrome and WhatsApp. even its own camera hangs many timevoice problem during loudspeaker.  10k to 12k phone is much better than this oneI am suggesting you don\\'t buy this product. its wastage of money\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been an Iphone user ever since Iphone was launched, i tried phones but could not even hold on to anyother for more than 3-4 days.With op7pro has done an awesome work.Camera, screen and typing is as good as iphone even better in camera.5 star.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Point1.Fast and buttery smoot- its so fast and smooth that you can hardly tell its opening the simple application or resuming it from ram.2.Display - 90hz display with FHD+ resolution will spoil you, it will literally make u swipe up n down without any reason.3.Speaker - Good stereo speakers will enhance your media consumption experience.4.Battery - Getting good battery life , on an avg 7 hrs SOT with gaming abt 3hrs.5.Weight n size - Size doesn\\'t bother me n yeah its lil heavy however i guess i ll get use to it.- one downside it that if u drop it prone to break due to its heavness.6.IP rating - Not n issue, its tested by manu YouTuber ,i.e it can survive lil water and anyway no company gives you warranty against water damage.7.WI-fi - Geting the speed ISP provide. So no issue.8. Wireless charging - Fast charging is enough.9.Camera - Decent not as good as pixel. Can improve with gcam .This is the area one plus needs to improve.10.No headphone jack- really missing that , i hv Bluetooth earphone but in gameplay u need wired headset or else it gt lilbit delay via Bluetooth so bought a dongle n getting use to it.11.Anything extra will incurred the cost also so at this price point all acceptable.All points are mentioned are according to personal my experience n views.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I received a faulty phone, network and WiFi connection goes on and off automatically. And When I called Amazon they said first their technician will check in next 3 days and after that replacement process will go on till that I have to wait, don\\'t knw how long it going to take üò†üò†üò†I used it for two days and noticably Battery and camera performance is poor not a flagship level of course.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been using this phone for last 2 days and must say that it is the beast (not just best) among the premium phones.The speed with which the page opens with your fingerprint and apps switches happen, the clarity and quality of the videos and the ultra loud but crystal clear speaker sound can beat many phones of better range any day. You can bet on it. The Samsung S series like curves at vertical edges of 6.67\" large screen and no bezels gives the phone very rich looks. By far the best OnePlus till date.The 4000 mAH battery lasts throughout the day with more than average screen time but the charging is again super quick (30 to 100% in less than 20 mins)Using gestures feels awesome and gives more screen space on already a very large screen.Camera is still under testing so no comments, however initial pictures looks very good.So for a new phone I rate it 5. Let\\'s see & review it\\'s performance after 3-4 months into use\\n\\n \\n\\n  I received a new OnePlus 7 Pro just yesterday, and when I tried to add both my sim cards in it, I found out the second sim slot was too small to add even a nano SIM card.After spending a day going from one shop to another to have my sim cut and everyone saying it was too small already, I found someone with the same phone, and they opened their sim card tray and said mine was defective.What kind of pathetic service is this?!This has not only made me not want to shop for anything on Amazon, but also has made me hate the brand OnePlus.OnePlus\\'s call centers are also not customer friendly.I recommend people not to buy this or any OnePlus device, because in such a situation you\\'ll eaither be phoneless (during the period Amazon replaces it) or you\\'ll have wasted such a huge amount on a defective phone, with no help from OnePlus.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0I got this phone on 3rd June and just within a week\\'s time I am facing battery related issues.Do not rush into buying this phone, wait for a while more and ask other OnePlus users if they are facing the same issues.  Maybe I got a defected piece . They even refused for a replacement. All they did was a 5 minute video check where in if the phone battery drops then 5% they replace else they dont.Just go through the video and you shall understand the entire scenario.Feel as if 50k wasted.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Time for a 7 pro review, I have used for 14 days now, so after using this giving review. Let me tell you one plus 7 pro is the worlds first fastest phone. 7 pro gives you premium feel, display is unbeatable, look wise this is the most beautiful, sexiest beast till date. There are many Indian you tuber spreading negative reviews of this phone but I tell you if you really wanna decide by review then watch out side Indian you tuber videoes. Yes price of this on high side as compared to oppo Reno, redmi k20 pro but you have to decide if you want to save extra 6k to 8k or you want a premium feel of a smartphone. If yes this phone is for you, if you really want to save money then you can go for 6gb variant also comes with same features, but nebula blue is still sexiest colour. Camera is also damm good, battery life is also good, performance is best. I was one plus 5t user before having this phone so performance wise one plus is best, just go for 7 pro rather than oppo Reno or redmi k20 pro, I bet you 7 pro is the worth buy. You won\\'t regret after buying this beast. This is the world\\'s first fastest, sexiest phone. Just go for it....\\n\\n \\n\\n  No doubt regarding the phone\\'s performance. However, the pre-applied screen protector is filled with bubbles and dust particles and seems like someone unprofessional has been applying these! I request you to please look into it and provide me with a possible solution as it has totally ruined the experience of owning a flagship and getting this kind of service!\\n\\n \\n\\n  For one I really do like the phone...coming to details the fingerprint reader is a tiny bit slow...but it has numerous unlocking options that work simultaneously...facelock is good...zone / location based is a good feature(though it\\'s not new) overall fingerprint does not make that much an impact.Speed is good.For screen it\\'s very good but for a gamer the buttons on the boundaries do make it a bit difficult to operate but once you get used to it it\\'s ok.Rear camera is very good can\\'t say it\\'s excellent. Front camera should have had more resolution and lighting option.Battery is good for a workhorse like this if you are a gamer expect 40% remaining battery by 3 pm. But the charger is way damn good in 20 min you are back to 90%...Headphones should have been provided, but I use wireless anyways...Tempered Screen protector should have come preapplied instead of the plastic one. mine is developing wrinkles because of gaming...OnePlus phones offer lots of customisation option if one needs and knows how....have seen lots of people not using customisation at all.Overall it\\'s a good phone and a welcome change.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Powerfully conceived and surely is a great upgrade for those replacing a phone after 2+ years. Processor is great, audio is loud and clear. Price is on the higher end but a worthy deal for people intense on email, social media and fast communication. Miss the 3.5mm jack or the in case wired headset but battery and display makes it up. Had it been, wireless charging could have taken this far further but love the warp charging. Fast fingerprint recognition and selfie camera allows decent face recognition. Oneplus has greatly enhanced the Android underneath. Worthy call if you need speed & quality.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Owesome sound by Dolby Atmos üëå, fingerprint sensor is super,fuild amyloid display is mind blowing,back cover perfectly fits.colourful theme is added including black and white themes which is superb.In built screen recorder in good.90hz refresh rate is smooth and fast.coming to draw backs there is no slot for ear phones we have to buy c type cable which connects earphones.and the screen guard doesn\\'t stick at ends were phone curves not a big problem and the price 53k think if your phone is lost then you will be heartbroken I lost my one plus 3t which costs 30k.\\n\\n \\n\\n  nothing special except screen\\n\\n \\n\\n  First of All Amazon You might have became the worlds best company but Kindly Focus on your customer service or you will lose thousands of customers just because of your service. Come To mObile.You can see that i have 3 one plus device. I bought One plus 7 pro mirror black 6+128 model.With The use of 10 days.2-3 days normal working i am not a Big fan of Games or Hd videos or like this i just put 30-40 normal productivity apps in the mobile.After 3 days Battery starts drainning i thought with update this issue will be solved but inwas wrong With in 10 days my fingerprint was not working, And On 10 Thday my Phone Was dead. Its not even power on guys ya I said it right.Is this we got in 49000 rupees. This should not be done. Mobile Phone is very overpriced it should have At ‚Çπ40000.Now come to Customer service part,I am calling from Last 10 days to amazon Customer Care they make false promises and just do formality Which they did with me.Finally i sent my mobile on my own courier expemse to company.Thats it kindly save your money And put it on right place\\n\\n \\n\\n  When there is a video call camera pops up while it is ringing, it should have been camera popping up when I accept the call. This put the selfie camera on risk if the phone is in your pocket n it starts ringingCalled up one plus service centre the answer that I got was this would get resolve when there would be a software update but by that time your camera could get affected\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is what I am upset for Amazon product I am very irritating about this product what the hell YouTube also not working well\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome phone... I m giving this feedback after using it 4 days...Pros: Camera quality is awesome... It\\'s rear camera is better than iphone x (I am also using iphone x)...No lag... It\\'s as fast as iPhone x...Battery back up is awesome...Display quality is awesome...Lighting fast charging...Cons: No led notification...No separate headphone jack... Because of it\\'s c type charging point I hv 2 purchase c type port for using any 3.5 mm jack headphone...For this reason I give 4 out of 5...\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am a oneplus fan (previously owned oneplus 2, 5t than 7pro) but this time I must say that OnePlus misguided about the camera, the S10\\'s 16 MP camera produces far more better pictures than 7pro\\'s 48 MP camera in every scenario, really disappointed with this purchase, I should have gone for the S10 instead.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\'One plus 7 pro fast, smooth and effortlessly powerful\\' as mentioned, or did the phone failed to live the hype. I am among those first mortals who got a chance to laid hands on this beautiful peice of technology and below are my findings after a week of use.Pros:1: Display- One of the bet that really paid off is the new edge to edge display in this phone, no bezels, no notch on the screen mean more screen to body ratio which looks quite stunning. However I am not facinated about the full screen display, I mean, yeah it\\'s great but you can find this kinda tech in many sub premium phones available out there. The big surprise this time is the bump in resolution, the phone now sports a  6.67 Inch, 2K+ resolution OLED Display which was long needed since screen to body ratio has increased reasonably since One plus 3t and given the price tag. Another +ve side is fluid AMOLED with 90hz refresh rate, it\\'s not cosmetic and I can say that because I am using a oneplus 3t along side this phone and I can easily see the difference in the screen response in 7pro, the animations are silky smooth, fast and flawless. Also another unique trait is this screen has got side edge display as like Samsung\\'s edge series. All in all the display ticks all the boxes, no questions.2- Memory and storage: I am using a 12 GB ram n 256 GB rom version, given the amount of ram multitasking glitches are the things of past. I tested it\\'s performance by parallely running nfs, pubg, asphalt nitro, clash of clans without any hiccups where as 3t faces some issues, thus heavy performance apps can run smoothly as the phone can take that all easily. Also 256 GB storage is enough to store images, vedios and files etc, given that we are living in cloud era.3 Speed: Speed has always been a trump card for oneplus  phones, and it\\'s the imperative reason of it\\'s existence. Even my 2 years old oneplus 3t never showed any noticeable lagg and 7 pro is no exception. Also this time the company has introduced liquid cooling to address over heating issues faced by early oneplus phones, however I still found some heating issue while playing multiple performance games but in normal day to day use it\\'s just ok. This beast takes all performance load with ease, so stay relaxed this phone won\\'t let you down.Cons:1: Camera: There is marginal improvement in the camera department from 6t but I didn\\'t found anything much as mentioned in ads, I compared the shots with my friend\\'s shots takes by s10+ and the later one stands out in terms of quality and wide view angle. S10+ camera on paper is low on megapixels but does better justice than one plus. Night pics are a slight better I can say, else Samsung\\'s done a good job here.2 - Pop up front camera: This point may not appease to all the readers but I am not a fan of machanized camera. Even oneplus suggest not to use face unlock much. There is also another clever peice of tech here by oneplus, if accidentally the phone drops out of your grip while the the front camera is still out, the phone will automatically detect the fall by using the inbuilt gyroscope and immediately pops the camera inside even before the phone touches the ground. However given all these corks and screwes, I still doubt the front camera may show signs of break downs in the long run.3- Missing headphone jack- While there are few people complaining about missing headphone jack, I personally don\\'t feel it\\'s a loss as I rarely use wired earphones and also I noticed most of my friends too use Bluetooth earphones. Wired earphones are the things of the past, get yourself a pair of good Bluetooth earphones and bingo! u won\\'t miss the jack anymore.4- Finger print scanner- Strangely the inscreen finger print scanner some time fail to recognize if you fingers are slightly moist due to sweat.Summary- Bit pricey when compared to the recently launched oneplus 7, but in terms of features and looks it\\'s leagues ahead not just from it\\'s own siblings but with most of the competitions as well.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s a oneplus phone and it gives more than what it has promised. The speed, options, video quality and ease of access all leaves you feeling royal.But in addition I loved Amazon service. I had exchanged my old phone for this and it was such a breeze. I faced no issues and was able to get the phone I wanted in record time. It\\'s just 24 hrs since I first ordered the phone on Amazon and it\\'s already set up and working as usual.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is the best phone from one plus ! For the price it checks all the boxes of flagship ! Been using for a week ! Everything flows and lovely to use it .if you are looking for a perfect phone with best display and good camera best software experience , I would recommend one plus 7 pro , as it\\'s the best phone with reasonable price ! It\\'s been a ride from one plus one to 7 pro and really happy one always pushes a step further ! You get none other than the best smartphone !Pros:Display the fluid display is awesome.Sound now you got that dual speaker set up , not so loud but clear and precise.Camera is goodBattery lasts more than a day with a normal usageGaming is awesome on the phoneHaptic feedback is much improved and much love for that.Last but not least a fast smooth software experience.Cons :Large phone it\\'s about 7 inch phone very hard to use one handedly but I am willing to learn it.The curved edge corners are not perfectly rendering the data of 3rd party apps , hope this will be fixed in software updates.No headphones jack , I have so many headphones which are useless now .\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very good and excellent using From past two days received on 17th of may , no issues with phone battery backup Good no heating, refresh rate too fastValue for MoneyPop up Selfie Camera is Great.Battery Life is Pretty Good.Music Sound System is Very Good.Inprint Finger sensor is Fast and good to unlock the phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was so confused in between S10+ and OP7 Pro because i was worried about weight and camera but both are excellent. I am glad that i opted OnePlus7 Pro. The moment i turned on the display i was simply amazed by its quality, seriously it\\'s just pleasure to eyes to watch and feel this display.Other than this performance, camera, OS, and premium look of Nebula blue all are just amazing.Go for it and trust me you not gonna regret it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The mobile received on 14th of August and the screen started flickering on 20th September. The service centers declared that liquid damage is the reason and the cost will be 17000.00. Now, how can a person prove that it was not dip on water and its already water splash proof as declared on amazon. Very poor service and will not recommend for one+ series.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have buy this phone on the first when it come on amazon for sale. but after comparing this oneplus 7 pro camera with old oneplus 6 and oneplus 6t they have much batter camera then this op7 pro. but they are avalabile in 32999/- and i have spent 53000/- almost 20000 for this phone but i am not happy with this phone camera.i cant return this product because i have purchase this phone on bajaj emi. but now i am feeling cheated by oneplus india.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Friends ordered this phone and received in just 2 days time. Very much happy with the purchase. Heard a lot of negative complaints like camera, phantom touch, slow fingerprint etc. Which phone haven\\'t has that. But this one really lived up to my expectations. The issues with this phone will definitely go away with updates, I received the first update and there is development in camera quality. I haven\\'t had any experience of phantom touch and poor fingerprint yet. The display is very punchy and accurate. OnePlus development team is very active and will provide all updates to optimise this phone..so go for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  First of all i m using ONE PLUS for the first time. The phone performance is mind blowing, no lag nothing at all.üñ•Ô∏èThe Display is so awesome, u will fall in love with it. üòçüòçüì∑ Camera is gud bt still it requires improvement in my viewüîã Battery is Good, i think due to big screen it consume battery a little faster, bt after updates it will be fixed definitely..üéÆGame lover Go for it no doubt..And dont think for negative review. I dont knw why people are so stupid.. üòÇ\\n\\n \\n\\n  Works like a charm little hefty but butter smooth.And for people talking about incomplete product delivery what you see on youtube is reviewers unit jot retail unit so stop with the dumb comments.My only complaint is that there is no headphone in the box and nor did the company provide the adaptor for the same\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s a beautiful beast. Screen is the best . No notch and no hole , the view is clear and you enjoy it. Oxygen Os is always like a stock android which is the best. Camera is okay. But yes I think they should have added type c 3.5 mm converter out of the box in such price segment.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The first thing firstThe design is awesome.Specs are awesomeAnd almost near to stock android is also awesome.This mobile is just super fast.I think spending 50k + on this is better than spending on Samsung items.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Overall Beast as everyone says!! but few things i have noticed after usage since a week..firstly i wud say RAM is being used drastically.. just for normal usage it wud consume approx 5 to 6 GB RAM without any reason.. i dunno how does that processing work at all...and battery is drastically draining since 2 days.. earlier 5 days were EPIC.. now i really do not understand what the problem is.. as the usage is same as before. planning to get it replaced but wat if it works the same!!!Camera app is not at all good. thy really need to upgrade their software to match the market level phones like pixel and nokia.Overall little disappointed with 12 GB Beast phone... Expectations were high but lets hope for the best for further usage..EDIT :  After 20plus days of usage and 2 updates working really fine and battery issue also resolved with some apps management. Now battery works upto 36 to 48 hrs for one single charge. Will update more once after i use it liitle extensively for few more days... Stay tuned!\\n\\n \\n\\n  I had been using my OnePlus 3T since December 2016. The device was still good enough for my daily necessities but the battery life dropped down to a considerable extent so I decided to get the OnePlus 7 Pro. My expectations were quite high, and guess what? This phone gracefully rose past all of them. Here is my review after three weeks of usage. Trust me, I\\'ve used the stuffing out of the device in these three weeks.Desirable features :1. Display : Arguably the phone\\'s strongest selling point. My mind was shuttling between the 7T and 7 Pro and the display is what sold by. Beautiful Quad HD curved display with 90 Hz refresh rate. Curved displays may not be for everyone, but I\\'ve condoned them since the s6 edge and hence, I personally love it. Accidental touches are also very rare (I do have fat fingers). As for the refresh rate, it improves the overall user experience and if you don\\'t believe me, keep a phone with a 60 Hz screen next to this and you will definitely observe the difference. The screen is pretty bright and has legit outdoor visibility as well. Night and reading modes also ensure you have a pleasant experience using it in the dark. Screen flickering is not noticeable for the average user but you have the DC dimming option as well if in case you do notice it.2. Software optimization : Oxygen OS is OnePlus\\' forte. Undisputedly the best OS available for android. It is buttery smooth and packed with just the right amount of features. I didn\\'t feel the need for a third party launcher. Rest assured, you will definitely receive regular software updates for three years at least.3. Performance : Moving from the 3T, this felt like riding a H2R after owning a splendour all my life. I haven\\'t noticed any lags or stutters no matter what task I threw at it. As for gaming, I\\'ve saved it for the end of the review. PUBG lovers do check out the bottom of the review for a detailed PUBG review. Spoiler alert : it outperforms even some of the gaming phones on the market today.4. Audio output : The dual stereo speakers are very loud. The clarity is excellent for listening to media and taking calls as well. Dolby Atmos is the cherry on top of the cake.5. Camera : Many reviews said that the camera was a disappointment. Well, OnePlus seems to have fixed it with numerous updates because when I got my device and installed all the updates, the camera performance was splendid. Pro mode allows you to tweak the settings considerably. Slow motion videos are good too, though not the best. Any normal user would be very happy with the camera as I had no complaints. it doesn\\'t beauty or oversaturate images. Initially, when I opened slow motion at night in indoor lighting, the screen was flickering and so did the resulting video. But it turns out it is not a manufacturing defect. The sensor cannot shoot slow motion videos on certain lighting conditions. But it works well in outdoor lighting. So if you try it for the first time indoors, do not freak out if this happens. Video recording at 4k;60fps is awesome too.TIP : Use Pro mode to click RAW images and then edit them on Snapseed. RAW files produce excellent details but also range from 20-30 MB per image. They are a little soft but Snapseed is all you need to edit the images.6. Network reception : Network reception and Wi-Fi speed is also much better. Internet speed is much better on this phone as compared to my older devices (3T and Mi A2 lite).7. Warp charging : It charges from 0 to 100 in just about an hour\\'s time. And the best part is, the phone doesn\\'t heat up at all. Only the adapter gets warm, but the phone doesn\\'t heat up despite the charging speed.8. Design - The phone looks beautiful and feels premium. The notchless display is a treat to the eyes. I have the nebula blue variant and the frosted glass back looks magnificent. It feels great to hold and even better to behold.Well, this phone does everything you expect from a phone perfectly. So the pros list would go on and on.Could be better :Battery life - OnePlus packs a 4000 maH battery. It will easily last you through the day even if you are a heavy user. I get 6-7 hours of screen on time normally and a little over 5 hours if I do a lot of gaming and YouTube. I have my display set at 9 Hz and 1440p resolution so this does pull a lot off the battery. But considering the size and weight of this phone, OnePlus could have provided us with a battery. I did try setting the screen to 60 Hz and 1080p and it improved the battery life by roughly 15-20%, but what\\'s the point of having such a powerful display and not being able to exploit it to the fullest?Liabilities :1. No headphone jack - When I buy a premium phone, I expect the company to at least pack a type C to 3.5mm adapter, if not a type C headphones. Come on, even apple gives you compatible earphones in the box. I spent an extra 390 bucks for the adapter. It works fine but would have been better if it came in the box.2. Tempered glass - OnePlus gives you an applied screen protector with the phone and it is good, but it is not shatterproof. When you have an expensive display, it is always better to secure it with a good tempered glass. But finding a good one is a pain. Either it has black edges, doesn\\'t cover the screen completely, or the application process is a hassle and error prone. And they cost at least four times the amount for flat screen phones. Have ordered one from glazedinc, let\\'s hope it fits the bill.A few perks :To make the phone look better, I downloaded wallpapers from unsplash. I also installed the flight icon pack (free version). You don\\'t need a separate launcher for it, Oxygen OS allows you to use icon packs and it is quite simple. You can customize the icons and even change the name of the apps(useful if you want to be shady).Also installed an edge screen app. Have attached a screenshot of my home screen. Also, enable dark mode. The display makes it beautiful.Set animation scale in developer options to 0.5x for an even snappier experience.I suggest you use the fingerprint scanner and avoid face unlock as the front camera has to pop up Everytime you need to unlock your phone. Besides it is very accurate and fast too. I\\'ve disabled finger unlock animation so make it seem faster (perception hack).Verdict :I have the 8GB RAM/256GB ROM version.  It is worth the 43 grand damage. Given a second chance, I\\'d still pick the same phone again and I am sure you would too. After all, it won the MVP award in MKBHD\\'s smartphone awards 2019. :)PUBG Mobile review :This is an absolute beast of a phone for PUBGM. Default settings itself was set to HDR + Extreme and it handled it very well. Constant 60 fps was achieved with minor drops to 58 and never below that. I personally prefer to play at Smooth + Extreme as bullets register the fastest in these settings (as said by professional players). I\\'m a four finger claw + full gyroscope player. I picked up full gyro practicing for just two weeks in this phone. Touch response is super quick and there are no multi touch issues. Gyro response is also perfect and I play with the same sensitivity as Snax. My gameplay has improved a lot with this phone. Curved display wasn\\'t an issue for me at all. You also have an in built screen recorder that records both internal and external audio. Recording your gameplay doesn\\'t affect the performance at all. Minor heating is noticeable after two classic matches if you\\'re recording. 5 minutes of recording at 60fps will consume close to 1GB of your storage. I can game for around 4-4.5 hours when the phone is fully charged. There is no thermal throttling and phone\\'s performance does not drop at all. Besides, the notchless screen improves.yoir gaming experience and haptic feedback is excellent too. If you\\'re looking for an amazing gaming performance as a bonus, this is the phone for you. The frame rate is even more consistent than ROG phone 2, second maybe only to iPhones.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Honest Review for One Plus 7 Pro :It\\'s my first one plus phone(12GB RAM, 256GB ROM) which I bought 4 months back and I am quite happy with the design and performance of it. I will try to cover most of the positive and negative aspects of the phone.Pros :1. Speed - I have used mobile phone of every company and I must say it has the best performance ever. Apps opened in just fraction of seconds.2. Display - It has been a wonderful experience of using 90 hertz display which makes it more superior than other mobile phone displays.3. Camera - Stability of the camera is very good even you are recording video in moving vechicle.4. Notchless display - One of the coolest feature of this phone is it\\'s full screen display without any notch which gives user an amazing experience.5. Battery - Currently, this phone has a battery back up of one and a half day. Will update it after completing 1 year.6. Fast Charging - It will take your phone to get full charge from 0 to 100 percent in just 1 hour 20 minutes. And in half an hour, it will charge your phone above 50 percent.Cons :1. Quite Heavy - As I have used number of phones I personally find it quite heavy which is due to hardware they have provided. But now I am habitual to it.2. Auto Brightness - Sometimes I feel the auto brightness feature doesn\\'t works well. So in that case I have to manually adjust the brightness. May be oneplus can fix this issue in the upcoming software updates.3. Night mode in camera - Night mode of the camera is not that good as compared to other phones. It could be more better. May be this can also be fixed in next software update.4. Price - Upto OnePlus 6T the price of the phones were nearly 35k. This is the first phone which costs nearly 50k. Quite overpriced but value for money.5. No IP rating - Although company claims that it is water resistant but ip rating must be given by company for such a flagship phone.6. Glass panel - The phone is very slippery if you are using it without cover and back panel can easily break. Therefore, I suggest to have a good case to protect.7. No 3.5 mm jack - You have to compromise with the 3.5 mm audio jack if you want to purchase this phone. I sometimes feel there must be 3.5mm jack but then I use bluetooth earphones.To sum up, although there are number of disadvantages but still this phone is value for money. I hope this review will be helpful.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Good points:1) quality feels premium while holding it in hand2) Superb sound quality and clarity3) Awesome display to look at4) Warp charging is much more faster than Dash charging  + battery retention time is average5) 90Hz barely makes a difference as compared to OnePlus 3 I used before this. But yes, Its indeed much more refined and smooth(still doesn\\'t justify the price tag)Bad Points:1) The camera although takes awesome pictures, but it does get blurred while zooming and viewing the pic from gallery2) The pop up mechanism makes mechanical sound while switching on/off. At this price, it bothered me. It could have been seamless.3) Bit heavy and huge. Gives a feeling of nervousness while holding it without any case(as its made of glass body)4) front camera is average. Similar to OnePlus 5T I would say(not much difference)\\n\\n \\n\\n  Never purchase from amazon, mostly products are defective and mostly there is no refund/exchange also. Instead purchase from one plus store. Be cautioud, i\\'m the victim, i don\\'t others to be.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Bought this device a month ago and during first couple of days the phone was overheating while charging. Within a few days, one plus rolled out an update and after that the issue was resolved. Speaking about the pros I would say the phone justifies its price. The look and feel of the phone is truly elegant and no words for its sleekness. Some people may find it a bit bigger, but when you are in love with tech and ready to shell out 50k on a phone, these issues are negligible.Secondly, the display is sheer beauty. It\\'s crisp and bright, and the difference is visible!I don\\'t use the phone like a maniac, hence I get a full day backup on a single charge. And even if you are a heavy user, still a 15 minute charge is more than enough to keep you going for next couple of hours.The sound quality is also very good, thanks to Dolby Atmos.RAM management doesn\\'t need any discussion. One plus phones are already prominent for their RAM management.Camera quality was initially on the lower side, but one plus has rolled out an update for that and, since, the camera quality has improved a lot.Lastly, the bigger screen paves way for a comfortable gaming experience.And now about the cons:The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow than the physical scanner, but the AI will get used to your fingerprints and overtime it will automatically improve. (Faced this issue was initially, but now it is quick as a Ferrari)Absence of headphone jack means shelling out extra cash for wireless headphones.No LED notification light. You have to check your phone so as to ensure you have not missed out on something.I am not a professional reviewer but I have tried my best to include my overall experience with the phone.Conclusion: One plus has, no doubt, used \\'cream of the crop\\' ingredients to make this beautiful piece of tech. I don\\'t have any regrets for upgrading from OnePlus 6. After all, you have to loose certain things to gain a better one!Peace.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Overall nice phone.I bought it because I wanted a notch less and fully bazelless phone so I am happy with it though it slightly big.I personally recommend OnePlus 7 because of these reasons:-1. You can save 20 thousand rupees for same features.2. Size of the phone is more suitable and handy. OnePlus 7 pro has awkward and uncomfortable size.3. Its too heavy your wrist starts to fall when continuous usage.4.Pop up camera seems good but not reliable for long run.5. Warp charging is just a hype It takes more than 2 hours to fully charge.Some good things because of them I bought it.1. Best display with 90 Hz frame rate.2. Curved display.3. No notch.4. So basically I gave 20 thousand more for the sake of better or say best display in market right now.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The display is amazing and it just grows on you. You can never use any other handset after using this display.Battery is good for 1 and half day usage but the wrap charge is dope.Weight is a bit heavy and big screen but big phones are the call of the day so can\\'t complain much.Design is so attractive and feels can never be backdated even after using this for 2 years.Camera specs are awesome and software is good bit with time it will improve more I am sure. Don\\'t get me wrong it gets decent pictures and great selfies.\\n\\n \\n\\n  OnePlus 7 Pro is a mammoth.The closest competition - the dilemma was should I go for the pro and pay 53k or the standard version and be done within 35k or so. Both have the same heart and soul. However, a waterdrop camera is a weird prospect. That, and only that made me choose the Pro. But when I got the Pro, I realised that the screen that came with it was just fabulous. I have never seen something like this and I will not see this in any other phone this year.The real flagship - Now that I am ready to shell 53k, it made sense to rather weigh the alternatives. S10 is the obvious answer but that punch hole is a turnoff for me. And again of all the features that S10 has that the OnePlus 7 Pro lacks, headphone jack is the only one I miss. Oh, and did I tell you about the screen on the Pro.... It\\'s gorgeous!The backroom - I have always believed that a product is a reflection of how the company thinks. Behind every great product is a group with high standard of ethics, skills and the never settle attitude. Beside Apple, I have found that in this time (June 2019) companies like OnePlus and Honor (Huawei) are frontrunners in their products as well as their vision. So go for their products. Honor does have better camera.The new OnePlus 7 Pro lacks in camera. It\\'s the only area it lacks in. But I see promise in the brand and future updates will make it better. I believe it. The battery drains faster when you play video games or watch videos. I found my screen on time to be close to 5.5 hrs with 16% battery remaining. 20% of the time was spent on PUBG, 15% on Google Play services and a combined 20%+ on videos. I found it quite underwhelming. However, once you take a break from your phone and go for lunch or a bath, you will be surprised to see how fact it charges. 0-100 in an hour. In fact plug it in for 15mins and you will see a 30% increase in charge.Everything else works like a charm. The fingerprint sensor is great. The first few times will be erratic but then it gets accustomed to the user. Works fine from there.The sound quality is almost great. It is loud but I wished that it was a tad bit better.The Oxygen OS is doing its job as we speak. It is so natural that you might not just feel that it\\'s not stock Android. It\\'s very close it the stock. And it\\'s nothing extravagant. Oxygen OS is just right...Overall, rating hereBuild 9/10 just for the lack of official IP rating.Camera 7/10 I have taken better pics from phones that cost half. Pop up camera is good.Display 10/10 can\\'t explain why. You need to see for yourself.Charging 9/10 This thing is a monster with Warp charger. And I don\\'t need the wireless charging.Processor 9/10 Blazing fast. Took away a point because there is always room for improvement.Value for money 8/10 the phone is great but the camera could be better. As a user, I am very satisfied. I would rather hold OnePlus 7 Pro than the Samsung S10+.Nominating the Pro for the best smartphone of 2019.Enjoy your shopping!\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s okay okay Phone nothing so much extra ordinary about op7pro in 50 k plus budget. For me i have used Lg v30 plus . I find v30 plus had better features and technologies than this one. V30 plus comes with Wireless charging  ,IP68 rating, quadack headphone jack. In 4gb ram it runs fine i have played PUBG in it for year long and never ever it said restarted . I found divice is beat underrated. If you are planning for same features go for it. Now LG v30 plus comes in 25 k . May be you can plan buy LG V40 plus in latest in OP7PRO budget with better features .Phone start working on itself.Finger sensor works only if you press rightly and tightly fingerprint sensor sucks compare to other flagship phone I will not recommend OP7 Pro.Wasted 50k.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Seriously i bought this phone because i thought one plus is a true premium phone and one plus 7 pro would be a new flagship killer. Its been 2 weeks i have been this phone and started having problem with this.After the os update which one plus suggested 2 days back i have started having problems with this phone.During voice call other person voice is not clear always.Screen started hanging and many such small problems.Being such a premium smart phone manufacturer company i did not expect this issues from one plus.They always talk about the specifications and features but not about efficiency and reliability.Why such issues after every update.And i can not even see any difference after os update and update affected my phone\\'s primary features.\\n\\n \\n\\n  1. ScreenOMG. Use this Hulk once and you see all the other devices as tiny toddlers. Screen is the next Generation feature and it\\'s absolute delight to watch youtube on this.2. Oxygen OSConfigurable. Sleek. Ease of use. It\\'s addictive3. Top notch configWeather it\\'s 12 GB RAM, 256 GB ROM or 30 htz Warm charging. It\\'s top notch industry leading configuration. What more you will ask for?No wireless charging. No IP certification. Not required and no body cares.OnePlus becomes a market leader with this dream phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my personal experience I am sharing. After 10days of purchase,  the phone got hanged during call, and the system didn\\'t work for half an hour,not even power and reboot button. The problem recurred after 1 week.  After investing this big amount for a phone,  this kind of experience really gets you into trouble.Also,  would advice Amazon to extend return timeline and should give 1 month for these kind of products, as these are big investment for the user.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Works like charm..... #oneplus Never makes their customer down...... But shows lill bit of sadism in releasing colours.... Overall im very satisfied wid CAMERA:- not soo wide angled but its great nd no additional things added jst like oneplus 6 nd 6 and front popup camera works fine and crystal clear images can be takenBATTERY:-works great whole day and heres a tip use fhd+ and 60hz refresh rate for better battery backup when u needy.....PERFORMANCE:- ONEPLUS never settles as it says..... Even i use 6gb ram not even small lag detectedStereo speakers and dolby atmos... Even there is no overhead speakers they managed well to cover it... Wat ever its a small defect but it works wellOverall it\\'s great product from oneplus and  #NEVERSETTLE\\n\\n \\n\\n  Worst camera quality...... I thought I m getting the best phone but it\\'s the worst one.... Plz do go for this mobile. With the amount of hype they made in media it\\'s just a wastage of money. This is not a trusted brand to go for. Even I don\\'t like to one star rest of the phone in the market will give the best phone with lots of features like vivo, oppo or Samsung. I raised a compliant with the tech team and will take it media for cheating us. I suggest all who are having the same problem take this to media in all forum, so that this company oneplus will understand and will do the needful. If not we have lots of ways to make them understand and return our money.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I\\'ve been an iPhone user for more than a decade and this is my secondary phone. I\\'m writing this review after having used the One plus 7 pro for over 2 months. This is possibly the best overall phone available in the market if the price is taken into consideration.Pro:Good camera for recreational use. (Not for photography enthusiasts).One of the best refresh rates. Makes the entire experience of using the phone seamless.The screen quality is amazing.The phone feels well built and almost premium quality.No NOTCHThe OS is one of the best I\\'ve used. Closer to the original android.Curved screen and 90 GHz refresh rate make it the best phone around for video viewing.Unbelievably Fast ChargingCons:The camera is not at the level of other flagships. It tends to correct photographs too much. If you\\'re looking to click accurate pictures its not the best one out there.The phone is quite heavy.\\n\\n \\n\\n  1.) CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD BUT VIDEO RECORDING CONTINUES NOT WORKING PROPERLY WITHIN 25 SECOND RECORDING ONLY.2.) MOVIE SEE IN MOBILE NOT PROPERLY BECAUSE MOBILE SCREEN AGAIN AND AGAIN SMALL SCREEN DIVERT.3.) MOBILE TOUCH WORKING MISSING.4.) YOUTUBE SHOW WIRELESS HEADPHONE AND 2 EXTRA COVER WITH PHONE BUT NOT RECEIVED WITHTHIS PHONE.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I brought it 5 days ago and lots of thinking between S10 then gone for this one. Sinse last 6 years I am using Samsung S series and still have my S8 as my secondary backup phone. No doubt the phone is good, fast, speedy, great display. I am not regret as its best value for money when hardware, performance and price considered. All these below points are just I dont like, there are lots of other things which I like as well.1. The phone is heavy and big. 207gram feels like a brick. If you fill-up a phone with features but still form factor is not practical use then this is a fail. UFS 3.0 storage only have write speed of 229MB/S, this is lower than some phones with UFS2.1 example: S10. The phone design is common and looks just like other Mi, Vivo Oppo phones. No X factor. In my view its a premium Chinese phone.2. Camera is a myth. Sony IMX586 is a failed and over hiped sensor in its era. Now a days used in mid range Chinese phones. I wish OnePlus should have skipped this one. If camera in a phone is your primary requirement then keep away from this. I love photography and have my DSLR for that so I dont trust any phone camera or that was not a concern for me. I have tested in all conditions and sorry to say this is a bad camera for a flagship. Front camera is good enough and I like it including its design. I recommed that please turn of scene recognition, auto HDR in camera settings menu to click at least some good pictures in day light. For night or dark light camara is good I believe. I assumed that the developer team put their entire efforts to bring a camera which can provide good photos in night and forget that we take most of the photos in day light. So those night calibrated auto settings will ruin your daylight photos. But still even if you try to get best shots, its far behind Apple and Samsung Cameras.3. Oxygen OS is good and fast I am using 1st time, but it doesn\\'t have native apps like Email Client, Music Player, Payment App, Security App, Calendar, Contact, Phone Call and so many others. For all these it\\'s depending on stock Android. Now you say whats a big deal? Apps are available in playstore for free to download. But I think those free application are comes with lots of advertisements, notification and even Google native apps track you for their add selling. I use yahoo mail, why I will pay yahoo 350 rupees monthly to use their email client. Another thing I noticed that Home bar doesn\\'t auto hide during keyboard popup so I accidentally click the home key many times during type and suddenly go to home screen. That is a big drawback. The home bar should be hide during type. OnePlus please look that simple but very useful stuff.Rest assured, I also agree with others that its an insanely fast phone. Battery is best in class as per my use. This is a good phone and would be best if Oneplus taken care of some useful requirements. A great Display and good hardware will not certify a phone as a flagship. There are lots of other aspects need to be considered. This phone doesn\\'t fulfilled my criteria of a flagship however personal choices may be different by individuals.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first phone in the premium category and I\\'m glad I went ahead with investing those extra 20000 rupees for a phone. 12 GB of RAM will look after every thing that you can ever ask of a phone. I had no idea of what difference a screen of 90Hz refresh rate or 60Hz meant. But after using this phone and having seen my friend\\'s 6T I can say that a 90 Hz screen is so buttery smooth that it spoils you. Fingerprint scanner has gotten better with every touch. Battery performance isn\\'t too great but it does charge lighting quick. The curved screen and the Fluid Amoled Display just packs that final punch.It\\'s not always we think of going for a 50k+ phone and if you\\'re thinking of upgrading your phone and have the budget, go for OP7Pro without any apprehensions.Edit: I\\'m no pro photograper but the camera seems to be better with additional features after the Android 10 update.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Good phone. - Review after usage for a week.Best Full screen display i have used till now. Soo smooth(90hz refresh rate is a killer one).Camera is pretty good than the other mid-range phones (15 to 25k).Battery performance is nice. got full day(morning 9am to night 11pm) battery with single charge. (Since it is a new phone im spending more time with it, still battery is preforming nicely. im getting up to 7 hrs for screen usage time, with regular usage of whatsapp, instagram, facebook, insthorts, camera, photos, google news, Pubg(2 rounds), youtube (up to 30 mins), phones call of upto 20 mins) - Refresh rate - 90hz.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s a beast.Exceeding all your expectations.Worth every penny.Jus hooe you may secure the phone.There\\'s a pre installed screen guard tepered glass.Such a goot battery backup with the best charging speed.I recoreded on my watvh it have 38 mins for full charge frome 20%Camera is just worth it better than googlepixel just a bit down in protrait.Only drawback is you don\\'t get earphones. Which OnePlus should have given in this pricerange.Hiving 5 stars on the basis of using ohone for 3 days.Worth it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This was a great deal offered by Amazon. The phone quality is top notch. 90hz screen refresh rate gives a buttery smooth experience while using the apps which support it. In-display fingerprint reader is relatively fast and accurate. Haptics is improved and precise but not as good as iPhone which is a lot more expensive.Battery life is not awesome but decent as it drains out faster when the phone is used heavily while playing games. Although the warp charging does really help out here. The phone charges upto 50% in under 20 mins. This 50% lasts quite a while when used judiciously.Camera quality is decent again. Photos come out crystal clear and sharp in good lighting. Night photos are not very clear and have a lot of grain. Inbuilt night mode provides a brighter image but still there\\'s grain visible in the photos. Selfie camera is also good. There is the motor noise when the selfie camera pops up and down. I dont recommend using the pop up camera for unlocking the phone.Considering the price, I would recommend this phone to anyone with this budget. This is 2019\\'s best phone afterall.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone is awesome, but I can\\'t really use my headphones right now because I didn\\'t get a 3.5mm to USB Type C cable. I tried buying it on the OnePlus official website but it is out of stock.The 90Hz refresh rate and everything else about this phone is fantastic.I bought the 12GB variant and I guess it is completely worth, since it gives a tough competition to premium flagships of Samsung and Apple.I play a lot of video games and I find this phone perfect for a person like me.While playing heavy-duty games like PUBG or Fortnite, the battery drains a bit fast but you can charge it from 0-100 in an hour.The screen is really huge, and because of its features I guess the phone weighs a bit more than other phones do.I would definitely recommend buying this phone to my friends or colleagues.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my biggest mistake to buy Chinese Mobile phone.In future I will avoid to buy any Item which is belong to China as China has attacked on my nation and my countrymen and brave soldiers are martyred for the pride of my nation.I would request Amazon to avoid selling of chinese product in India to respect our National emotions.Request to all other Indians not to Buy Chinese Products.Nothing is important than National Pride.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is absolutely FANTASTIC! Works like a charm. The best thing is the display! Nothing comes close to this!A few cons I noticed are:1. The phone is kinda long from the usual ones.2. It\\'s heavy (especially since I jumped from Oneplus 3 - 150g to oneplus 7 pro - 200g)4. The case that comes with this is slippery so better to buy a new one. I\\'m looking for one now too.5. The battery seems to go down a little faster to my liking with the 90Hz on. I haven\\'t tried 60Hz yet thanks to the WARP charger.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Just one word . Amazing.  The speed is terrific and the response from the insane machine is mind boggling . It switches from tab to tab like lightning . Front camera is a pop but have no fear.  It\\'s well designed and has fall prevention sensor . Phone doesn\\'t have headphones slot and hence need to use wireless . Sound and video clarity is beautiful . I would suggest this phone to people like me who still believes in Android and for the love of Goodies it offers .\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am very happy with the product. But what\\'s the meaning of phone without headphone jack or connector. If we are buying the phone of 50000, the company cant even provide us the connector for earphone? I would suggest not to go for this phone until and unless they have a solution for this. Before buying this phone just think why didn\\'t they provide Type C earphone or connector. If we are spending more than 30K on any phone. We expect all accessories for the same.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It is my costliest ever phone and while reading couple of reviews, I was a bit sceptical on ordering.But finally ordered and a big surprise. I live in tier 3 city and the phone was scheduled to be delivered the very next day. Such super fast delivery has never been heard. I was able to reschedule the delivery date easily on chat with customer care executive. Excellent.. Pros .1. Outstanding display. The quality of the display can not be told in words . It has to be experienced to feel.2. Camera quality. The default 12MP pics are sharp and feel life like. The 48MP in Pro mode is somey out of this world.3. Battery. The 4000 mAh battery is more than enough for a normal user ever at QHD and 90 refresh rate. If you need to last longer, just reduce the screen resolution. The battery was 67% when I received the phone. Even after 1 system update install, 20 app updates from playstore, and setting up the entire phone, the battery stands at 31% after 17 hrs of starting the phone for first time. Great.4. Hardware. The SD855 is more than sufficient for most users while perfect suited for a heavy user.5. Warp charger supplied with phone.6. Thick transparent cover supplied and has cuts at right places which don\\'t obstruct the moving front camera.Cons1. Pricey.2. The pre applied screen protector is good for nothing. It already had bubbles in it and within 6hrs of receiving, it had worked loose from all 4 corners. It won\\'t last long and will surely peel off soon.3. Nothing supplied. At 53k, leave a wireless headphone, it doesn\\'t ships with even a wired headphone.4. Packaging could\\'ve been better while shipping a 53k phone. Even a 200 Rs phone cover has better packing. No bubble wrap to prevent jerks and shocks. Just a Amazon branded cardboard and nothing else.Desired.1. Wish it had shipped with a wireless headphone.2. A pre applied 3d tempered glass for better protection.Update. All this is rubbish. The phone has developed a fine green line at the edge of display and within 4 months of purchase, the display nuas to be changed. And as always, service center terms this as physical damage and refuses to honor warranty.Never ever buying OnePlus. Even a phone worth 4000 doesn\\'t has problems in 4 months.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Feels very premium to hold and the 90 hz refresh rate is just too good.. feel like its a bit over priced.. and for those who expected 2 cases and wireless earphones, its a special review package which is clearly told by the presenter.. there is no earphone or even 3.5 mm earphone adapter which should be bought from after market.. All the functions of the phone works like a breeze.. no issues so far.. overall its a good phone..\\n\\n \\n\\n  The OnePlus 7 pro is a large phone at 6.7 inches. It is heavier than you\\'d expect and is a little difficult to use single handedly. The bezel less screen sometimes makes it hard to use gesture navigation. Besides this there is literally nothing to complain about. The phone is incredibly fast, the display is incredibly satisfying, the camera is great even if it isn\\'t the absolute best, and the UI is brilliant.Recommend to anyone looking for a phone in this price range if one handed use is not a big concern.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I ordered my OnePlus 7 Pro with lot of doubts in mind specially it not being water resistant and camera quality in previous versions.I highly recommend the OnePlus 7pro and writing this review so it might help others .Pro-1) Screen - Best Screen so far on any phone and with 90Hz refresh rate it is best mobile to play games with . I love playing PUBG and Asphalt 9 on Top setting and Result are terrific.2) Portrait Mode - OnePlus has never been the Best Camera device in market but OnePlus7pro has one top notch portrait mode. You will love taking Portrait in this device.3) Speed - With Latest 855 Snapdragon , I never laid hands on such smooth Android device . I can directly compare smoothness to IphoneX on this device.4) Built Quality - OnePlus 7 Pro has very strong built quality which I found very impressive. I did checked out YouTube videos to found its durability and was impressed.5) OxygenOS: With OxygenOS the experience of Android is smooth as silk.Cons :Water Proof : Only reason to not buy this mammoth phone . I was planning Huawei P30 Pro but then we have water proof cases for that purpose.Fingerprint Sensor : It does seems temperamental at times .Headphones : No Headphone Provided with devices and No Headphone Jack . Seriously heavy disappointment.Wireless Charging : Wireless Charging is a show off feature. We all know it\\'s very slow but it does look good to flaunt.Weight : If you don\\'t prefer Heavy phones , let this go . ONEPLUS 7pro is 200 gms and definitely feels heavy . Though I found  myself attracted to heavy phones .Review : If Best camera is priority  and you do tend to take underwater photography seriously, Spend 20K Extra for Huawei P30 Pro.OnePlus 7pro has a great camera , it\\'s 3x zoom and bokeh is awesome . And is a great device , if you are looking for Good Camera , Super Cool Build and Best Performance.Speed is what OnePlus were really always selling here. This time they really went Beyond Speed.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is worth of money .I have seen on youtube they provide headphones and car dash charger with two extra cover.But i didn\\'t get any of them totally disappointed with one plus team.If they are not giving such things then they should not show such things in their videos along with box .\\n\\n \\n\\n  One of the beast in this price rangeEven in mid 2020 this is the best choice for the price1. Oxygen OS is so fluid and blazing fast.2. No lags at all and butterly smooth.3. Aggressive RAM Management4. Display is outstanding, Colors are best , Viewing angles are great.5. Processor is Blazing fast.6. Battery is Amazing Screen on time is almost about of 6 hrs with 1.5 hr gaming , Switching between mobile data and wifi , Streaming OTT , Watching YouTube .7. very well optimised software.\\n\\n \\n\\n  PRO\\'s1.Display- Stunning it is the Best Display Today2.Design and Build Quality- It will blow u out3.Perforamce- The Fastest Android Phone no need to say Snap 855 with Oxygen OS Deadly Combination Absolutely Beast4.Camera- It is the Only department Where it is behind Pixel or Galaxy Note or Apple or Huawei Flagships Still it is not deal Breaker5.Audio-Stereo Speakers Damn Loud6.Vibration-Just Amazing Haptic feedback7.Connections-Call Quality brilliant Tested with Airtel and Idea networks8.Battery- Will get uu 1 day mostly and Warp Charging it will take 0-100 percent for about 80 mins initial 80% will be charged in 50 mins but last 20% takes 30 minsCON\\'s-1.Biggest Con is No 3.5 headphone jack nor type C earphones in box2.No Wireless Charging not usefull though3.No official IP rating could have given by them4.Bit on a Expensive Side by OnePlus5.No Gorilla Glass 6 Which is Shocking\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been using OP7 Pro for last 7 days and I found performance of the phone, camera, battery live up to OP expectations until 7th days.  I witnessed a song app is playing music even after I killed all the process. As last step, I restarted the phone and to my surprise phone got stuck at restart for a minute or so without doing anything. After couple of minutes, I see screen going blank and photo just died. It won\\'t start whatever you do. I finally found that this is a happening to many OP7 Pro phones and way to recover is pressing Power and Volume up key.Overall very disappointed . This has made me think if we should even trust and buy any more OP phone at all.I also found that once you purchase a phone through Amazon, it is not easy to return a defective phone. Even if you are still within 10 day return window, you cannot just ask for a replacement for defective phone. You have to spend good amount of time with Amazon customer service who will get a technician to visit you and find all ways not to accept the return which is very disappointing.So, firstly it is good to avoid this model till OP fixes this issue. If you still want to buy it, better buy it from retain stores and not online because you will be stuck with this product even if you don\\'t want to.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my personal review after 2 days of usage and one thing is for sure , that this is the BEST DISPLAY ever, just like said at the event \"FAST AND SMOOTH\". Watching series/movies is a pleasing experience and hands on to One plus for that.The performance is smooth and amazingly fast as always with OP. They are Masters in this segment.I saw many comments on social media regarding the average battery backup, yes it is true but with WARP CHARGING it doesn\\'t really matters. It is more than a balance to me. I won\\'t mind burning more battery for a smoother experience which is new and missing with other brands.The biggest drawback I felt is the Camera. The pop up camera has got too much crop and if you open the video then you might end up shooting yourself only. The Rear camera too needs some optimisation which I am sure we will see soon.One thing which I want to bring in notice is the \"NIGHTSCAPE\" mode in Rear camera, it was working good before the first update and as soon I updated it , the quality went down. Same is with the normal one as well.One thing I felt which should have been given is the Type-C to 3.5mm jack cable, that was indeed missing. Rest everything is just perfect.Overall I will give it \"4 stars out of 5\". Deducted one because of the camera, was expecting a better one with OP7 pro atleast. I am optimistic that OP will come up with a strong solution soon. üññüññ\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first One Plus phone hence I don\\'t  have a baseline to judge against.Pros:1. Excellent camera quality.2. It\\'s a beauty to look at( P.S: I bought the Nebulae Blue).3. Display is just superb.(The resolution even when set to FHD+ and refresh rate of 60Hz is class leading).4. Snapdragon 855 is the fastest Qualcomm processor as of now so no knit picking in the speed and performance aspect.5. Price is perfect for all that you are getting.6. Selfie cam is better than I expected.Cons:1. The wide angle camera is a huge let down.(I have tried the S10+ wide angle lens setup and it\\'s not comparable with this lens).2. No USB type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter.( Another huge let down if you are used to getting earphones out of the box.)3. The QHD+ and 90Hz refresh rate drains charge fast and it\\'s pretty obvious.4. At least a splash proof body could have been given at this price ( This is because splash proof displays and IP rated Samsung phones start around the 10 - 20K price range).\\n\\n \\n\\n  Almost a week of use now and I\\'m loving it from every aspect. It\\'s a flagship phone at a much lesser price than the other brands. Camera quality is superb and even night mode is great (only on the primary cam though, night mode doesn\\'t work well in zoom/tele). It looks stunning, performance is superb and battery life is great even for a heavy user.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Better than Samsung M30,A30,A50,A70,mi note 7pro, poco f1, vivo v15, oppo f11 pro, one plus 6t and all other middle(under INR 30000).Also better than iPhone 7, 7plus, 8, 8 plus, xr and upper middle priced phone(up to INR 60000).Also ignore all other brand phones.Points:1. Camera is excellent, night mode is brilliant2. No lagging at all3. No heating issue4. Comes with warp charger in box, super fast charging5. Front screen is the curved and totally premium look. 6.67in Fluid Amoled Display (2340 x 1440 pixels, HDR10+).6. No bending issue. Solid body.7. Sceen is not bleeding. No problem at all.8. Android pie (v9) with one of the most lightest skin Oxygen OS 9.5.3GM21AA (lots of customizations possible)9. No network issue (mobile network, wifi, screen casting)10. Little bit Slippery back side due to glass body. You can buy back cover for that. Also Silicon cover is come within box, if you like it.11. Popup camera is automatically lowered during free fall. ie. If you are using your phone with front camera poped up, and accidentally you drop you phone, front camera will be automatically goes back inside.12. No bloatwares (only Google apps(can not uninstal), one plus\\' 3-4apps(some of them can be uninstall) and Netflix(can not uninstall) are pre-Installed.I bought one plus 1 back in 2014. After that no phone attract me to buy it. But finally made my mind to buy this phone. And so far, no regrets at all.Jumping 6 generation(from one plus 1 to one plus 7pro) is fun.Hope you also like this phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought this phone only for snapdragon 855 processor and all new 90hz display. I am satisfied with the display and the performance it provides. I don\\'t use camera of any phone so my review will not tell about camera. But as I\\'ve seen with this phone camera quality is little bit average I\\'ll say. This phone have some serious issues about the weight balance and absence of 3.5mm jack (adapter is not available also inbox ofcourse they want customers to spend valuable money on there brand). And non availability of 3.5mm adapter on official site is also a problem. Stereo speakers are also soo average.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been using this for quite few months and first look is very impressive. The curved edge to edge display gives very premium feel. Here is how it goes for performance-1. Display is bright and no problem in reading even in outdoors. Scratch resistance is impressive. I am not using any tempered glass or screenguard and I don\\'t find any scratches till now.2. Battery is impressive and quick charge is really quick about 40-45 mins for full charge.3. Processor is best, no lag ,no hanging and no heating isuues even with heavy use.4. Audio is decently loud and clear.5. Camera is the best part of this phone. Back and front both cameras give awesome clear pictures. I will try to add few samples here and you can judge by yourself.6. Just one issue with fingerprint sensor in display and I found that on screen sensor is not as sensitive as sensors on back.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Review after 6months:Not preferable,1. when try to put face unlock that will the most weird thing you\\'ll see, coz the cam should pop out and detect you and which will take time to complete this process.2. Major drawback is NFC(tap & pay) is disabled/not working, why would you put more money when this are not working?3. Lots and lots of bugs like when you swipe for menu most of the times you will observe the apps invisible.4. Phone gets heated alot and lot when you play pubg/games.5. As per the company this phone should hardly get warmer when you use for a long time, but the AMOLED this is pure nonsense.6. You\\'d feel it very slippery without having a cover.7. Battery backup is not that great, it will make you to charge twice in a day.8. Accessories are touching sky with their price.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have bought this phone 10 days back. While the phone was in my pocket with some keys the back panel got cracked .Poor plastic quality is being used. And for the repairs if you will go to their so called EXCLUSIVE service centres you\\'ll hardly find air to breathe. They just have 1 repair engineer who looks after all the devices .If you are spending half a lac rupees on such a gadget then it just feel as if I have thrown my money in the garbage.They dont have adequate staff to manage their repairs even.Finally i have spent another 4k on getting the new back panel which they are again claiming can break any time.GREAT SERVICE HATSS OFF!!!DONT BUY!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Just an amazing phone... I upgraded from Redmi Y2 and trust me guys...if you are upgrading from some 10-15k phone to this one... you\\'ll surely love this device. The display is the best thing here, 90Hz refresh rate makes it so smooth to swipe... The phone no doubt is blazing fast..no lags or whatever seen till now. Some people were complaining about Ghost Touch or Pop up camera coming out while calling, we\\'ll I haven\\'t seen anything like that till now. These issues are present only on a very small no. of devices, so most probably you won\\'t get a defective one...Warp charging is brilliant. Overall I think you should go for it. Don\\'t see those camera reviews and all....OnePlus is improving them constantly...even I got a camera improvement update too...Soo I think it\\'s the perfect phone under 50k\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is beautiful gem. I ordered it even after knowing of all the issues people are facing on it, I was little afraid but thank God I am not facing any such issues, no ghost touch, no battery drain etc. Camera might not be good for people who regularly use high end devices, but it\\'s not bad. The overall experience is just amazing be it sound from speakers, the beautiful display and the smoothness of OS\\' transition animations, and ofcourse the new haptic feedback motor is amazing, it makes the overall experience even better. If you have money to spend, don\\'t hesitate and go for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  There is a black spot on the screen. First i thought it is a dust particle under the screen protector. But after i removed the protector after 2 weeks, i knew the pixels are not working. I cannot attach screen shot because it wont show up on it since its the hardware problem. It is really annoying. I am not getting any help too. Worst mobile and service. PLEASE DO NOT BUY ONEPLUS.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0I know this time people might feel this mobile is over priced by oneplus, but the features this mobile has, other companies like samsung or huawei might have priced it over 80k.Fingerprint reader is definitely faster that the 1st gen used in oneplus 6t. It is much quicker now.And quick pay is nor quich launch and we can set a no. of apps from which we can choose what to open which long pressing fingerprint rrader which unlocking and swiping to select app after unlock like paytm scan, phonepe scan etcCamera is another plus.The quality is great and telephoto is cool but needs improvement thought which is easily possible via software updates.Battery life what is get is arount 6 or 6 and a half hrs screen on time with quad hd resolution with 90hz. Yes both this settings will take a lot of battery but 6 6 and a half hrs for this setting is not bad. If we turn doen to 60 hz we might net few extra hrs but believe me one you are in 90hz it doesn\\'t feel like going back to that laggy experienceOverall a totally worth mobile for the pricetag given by oneplus is is still a lot cheaper that what other companis might have offered.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Not value for money . Bogus\\n\\n \\n\\n  Thank you Amazon for quick delivery. coming to product iam using 8GB version no words to say the speed is in controlled didn\\'t get any lag it\\'s very smooth.Screen OnePlus you nailed it 90hz awesome to use battery some are complain about SOC but iam getting 7hr 30 min roughly which is pretty best as my side.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Great product, I am very happy but there are few issues1 . At the time when I booted this mobile very first timeError was giving again and again \"stopped working\"I had to resolved by formatting it using clockwork recovery mode2. Gyroscope sensor have a very major issue. It works on opposite direction.3. While using Bluetooth volume slider popping again and again which is irritating. But in next two days that issue completely gone. It may have a update issue.But still I will give this phone 4.5 star because performance of this phone is unbelievableYou cannot compare with other brand\\n\\n \\n\\n  Best Gaming Experience90 Hz Frame Rate implies smooth displayCrazy SpeedSuper Fast ChargingEven with High-end games like Asphalt 9, Battery does not drain fastDisplay is magnificentThe only limitation is some may find the size too big and screen too big,but for an average person like me, It is better than anything I ever imagined.Great Job One Plus.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Genuine review, i have other flagship phones and for a moment i thought I\\'ll try something new which was one plus 7pro, and i regret my decision since then. It is one of worst phone..they have priced at premium phone. But it\\'s nowhere premium phone ..i feel it upgrade version of MI phones..not sure what this gimic is. Qhd 90hz refresh rate..all nonsense. Camera is biggest let down..with no waterproof certification and wireless charging..i regret i hav seen all this before..now i want get rid of this phone..i want to sell ..used only 1month..it\\'s a cheap phone with highly priced.\\n\\n \\n\\n  First of all this phone is value for moneyThe camera quality is phenomenalExcept for the front camera performance in dark confition is very poorThe finger print scanner is not that accurateThe battery life is very goodBest battery in any smart phoneThe display is greatPotrait mode is avgNight scape mode is amazingBetter than s10 plus in all aspectsIf you are confused btwn note 10 pls and op7proGo for op7pro\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am using this phone from last 9 months and from six months every thing which is on screen constantly like battery symbols and every thing on that line embosed on screen permanently and fingerprint symbol is also visible every time i am using instagram so frequently so instagram symbol is also i on screen permanently it\\'s like tattooed on screen I am very disappointed by that I need refund or u can replace my phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone is very much modified than previous models of OnePlus.Pros: Very fast finger-print sensor, awesome UI, Bigger than bigger display which is awesome!, 4K recording is nice.Cons: Camera quality issue, much weight, heating problem.But overall this phone is the best.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Hi one plus /Amazon team,  the one plus seven I used has a glass internal hairline Mark and glass flows from inside on bottom left corner. It can lead to stress in glass and self breakage or blast. I have seen it today ...one day after return window is closed. Please allow to replace ..it is a manufacturing defect\\n\\n \\n\\n  Excellent phone. Delight to see & hold in your hands.OnePlus has done an excellent Job - they picked all new funtions , new technologies (pop-up camera, curved screen, QHD dispy, on-screen finger print, 90 hrz etc. ) & added to this phone. - Intelligent approach.Has an excellent screen, 90 hrz is exceptional experience ( now when I use my older phone, it looks like sluggish)Very responsive finger print. Good battery (for me at least), innovative gestures etc.Overall an excellent experience. Thanks\\n\\n \\n\\n  1-Bettery should b optimised but i m okay with the warp charge thats pretty fast2-Device is heavy in weight3-camera is the most important highlight in any device, its good but not like other flagships, it need an improvement via software update4-Speed is awesome5- Gaming experience is top class, its very smooth6- Display quality is awesome, vivid, colourful, sharp and very smooth7- From my opinion there should some more font styles like samsung8- Video experience is very crisp and clear9- Streo sounds are loud and clear with dolby support10- Oxygen OS is best in world, so many customizable options are available11- 3.5mm jack is missing, its very sad, so i have used new oneplus wireless bullet 2 and the experience was just never before12- IP rating is missing , its almost now flagship level pricing so oneplus should maintain this13- Fnatic mode is very helpful during game play15- Camera night mode is nice\\n\\n \\n\\n  Great Delivery from Amazon. Got it delivered on 17th with morning delivery. Now let\\'s talk about phone.Display is just one of the best. It\\'s 90hz display makes the phone seem so smooth. It\\'s just like a butter. Performance is always awesome in one plus and this takes one step forward with UFS 3.1. camera is a good improvement over 6T but still can\\'t be compared with other flagship.I was little hesitant about pop up camera but oh boy it works awesome. It is a good implementation. Phone box doesn\\'t include USB to 3.5m converter. Charging speed is awesome. Camera is good but requires some software optimization.\\n\\n \\n\\n  What I like--Excellent performance, fast bootup and instant app loadup-Display is the one that impresses me the most with its 90hz refresh rate and curved glass-Build quality is great, slim design and glass back give the premium feel-OxygenOs is great, gives one of the best UI experience-Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos makes the sound crisp, clear and loud.-Has gaming mode which boosts up the performance while gaming-Camera is great, but needs improvement.-Charging is very fast and also doesn\\'t refrain from using phone while charging-Lastly, on screen fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurateWhat I dislike/ poorly like--No headphone jack-Box hardly contains any accessories unlike other flagship phones; no type-c adapter, no complimentary headphones, no otg cable; only charger and sim ejector tool-Hybrid Sim slot-Photos clicked have heavy detail loss, when magnified the objects far away seems smudged, not expected in a flagship phone like this.-Face unlock is a bit slow due to popup mechanism-Battery drain is high when operating it at QHD+ resolution and 90hz display but can go for a day with moderate use.-Factory applied screen protector is of very low quality, doesn\\'t even stick properly on the edges-Finally, price is bit high compared to other flagship phones with similar specification.\\n\\n \\n\\n  If you want to buy a true flagship phone and don\\'t care about brands, then buy it. Probably the best screen and performance in the market right now and an excellent camera. Battery is decent and warp charging is a thing of dreams.Pros -1. Best display ever.2. Best performance stats.3. Decent battery life. Fastest charging.4. Excellent camera. Pixel and Samsung does it better.5.excellent stereo speakers.5. Price is cheap.6. Stock android feel with some upgradesCons -1. Bulky and heavy.2. Not up certified. Some reviewers claim it to be splashproof though.3. No headphone jack and wireless charging.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is very good. Two weeks of usage and there is no problems with my unit. Camera is good, not awesome neither aweful as some reviewers advertised. Battery life is good but not great, the best part is the display that can be termed awesome. Overall a good phone to have but there are other alternatives if you are willing to go.Features:1. Flagship processor and built2. Awesome Display3. Good Battery life4. Good Camera performance (didn\\'t expect to be good because of some biased reviews)5. Nebula is the new favourite6. Oxygen Os\\n\\n \\n\\n  Am an ardant fan of One plus phones and always cherished to own one. Was eagerly waiting for 8 series launch, so upon on launch decided to buy one. On comparing specs in gsmarena with 7 pro and 7t pro , it\\'s observed , 8 series is wayblow in specs. I suppose the high rate is because of its IP rating .To the product review it\\'s simply the best feel you have while using this. Cameras offer crisp and natural colours, sensons are too good. Fingerprint response , gesture controls are well justified.I definitely recommend this if you are buying a phone for min 3 years use.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Super display quality, great touch feel,best in camera phone, battery life is ok,rest super mobile overall .But theres only one big caution the discount which Amazon mentioned in terms of (no cost EMI discount) is totally rubbish the cost of mobile is 50999/- we have to pay to them if we choose 6months EMI option we have to pay 8499.93√ó6=50999.58.Then why mentioned no cost EMI discount and all  it shows the value of one plus 7pro is RS 48979.64 in order summary.who will give this discount of RS 2019,Which Amazon mentioned in order summary.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Oh my God awesome product!The screen is freaking smooth and nice build quality. Camera is better than any other one plus phones and even competes other cameras.Battery is bit on a rough side and is expected due to 90hz screen rate but it charges equally well and very fast.Loving it\\n\\n \\n\\n  What a phone. Totally worth every penny. The screen is the main attraction. The quality is out of this world just woowww.  The camera is good I won\\'t say it\\'s the best. But the smoothness is unreal the speed is unreal it\\'s silly fast. And cherry on the cake is the wrap charger it charges your phone in no time. The look is classy and soft but still impactful.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Onscreen Finger print reader is very slow and most of the time does not work. You have to pick the phone up and press the reader for 2-3 seconds or more in order for it to detect the finger print which many time does not work properly.This phone has very serious overheating issue and starts burning with 10-15 min use if you r using playing games. Google is completely filled with user reporting this issue with no proper answer.Battery drains very fast due to overheating and phone temprature rise to > 46degree and you can\\'t even hold the phone in your hand.Third class phone by one plus.\\n\\n \\n\\n  At start the handset crashed,showing android had stopped working. Then I contacted One plus care and the advised to either replace or do the hard reset. The hard reset worked and the phone is working perfectly.Performance,charging speed,camera,display everything is good. Sound clarity is also good. Overall a good flagship product. üòä\\n\\n \\n\\n  1. Display and wrap charging is really awesome2. Battery life is good on 60Hz speed and okish on 90Hz3. Speed of  faceunlock is good and fingerprint reader is VVGood\\n\\n \\n\\n  The product is simply awesome. One plus has surely  put a lot of work to make such elegent design and superfast device. The screen experience is just out of the world, its buttery smooth. Speed has always been the forte of One plus and Kudos to the team you wont even find one slightest of a glitch while using this device. Allso dont worry if you hate waiting for long hours to get your battery charged, the new 30W Warp charger does its job for you in no time. The camera quality is also decent and fulfills all your daily requirements. Overall the experience has been very good and trust me you wont be regretting your purchase, So if you are planning of buying one simply go for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The display is just too good. I was unsure about the battery life because of mkbhd. But in my use I\\'m getting around 7 hours of SOT with 90hz and 2k resolution.Post camera update, the hdr issues have been almost solved.In my opinion the higher price is worth it, the other flagships at least in India are way too overpriced\\n\\n \\n\\n  *Fingerprint Reader : Very fast and excellent*Camera : Nightscape shines the brightest, overall camera quality has improved drastically with recent updates*Battery life : More than enough for a day of heavy to moderate usage*Os : Oxygen Os with Android 10 gives excellent user-friendly performance*Display : 90hz packed with QHD display gives amazing visual and ultra smooth touch experience**With MKBHD\\'s \"Phone of the year Award\" Overall  performance of this phone is excellent and one should definitely go for it for complete user-friendly and buttery smooth experience **\\n\\n \\n\\n  Writing review after exact one month of usage.Pros:1. 90hz display: Full screen 90hz display will make you want to go back to your phone again and again. It\\'s smooth, it\\'s amazing in a layman\\'s term. If you\\'re a gamer, prefer watching movies on your phone you\\'ll definitely love it.2. Camera: Camera quality is superb and I personally feel is at par with iPhone XI and outdoes iPhone in several conditions3. Battery: It offers a superb battery back-up lasting whole day without heavy usage. Even with the heavy usage the battery drain is quite slowCons: None so far.I know One Plus 8 is around the corner but if you\\'re a fan of full screen display then One Plus 7 Pro is a go to phone, because speculations are rife that One Plus 8 will feature a punch hole display which I personally feel is a step back.\\n\\n \\n\\n  An amazing phone with everything you need.It provides an ultimate user experience with 90hz display everything is so smooth never experienced lag yet.Fingerprint reader is fast but 1 in 10 times it might not recognize your fingerprint and that\\'s okay one can settle with that.It is much better than the gaming phones out there with fnatic mode and the display it is just perfect.The camera was good with some minor issues when i received the phone but after the update the camera experience has been alot better.It provides me a screen on time of around 5-6 hours  which is quite good because i am a heavy user.*All in all this phone justifies it\\'s pricing*\\n\\n \\n\\n  I read more reviews on this phone and saw many videos of reviews and tech experts many of them say that it\\'s the best phone in Android. As they mentioned seriously it\\'s the really the best phone. Best features. I took 8gb ram 7 pro.1. Display, 2. Touch, 3. Camera, 4. Speed, 5. Design, 6. Battery life, 7. Fast charge.Drawbacks1. No headset jack.2. Portrait mode is only for limited distance.3. Memory card slot.As it is the premium phone and paying 53k we expect basic things like headset jack or the headset. But didn\\'t even give the music jack connector.All the premium phones have wireless features but we miss in this phone. Hope it comes in next version.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought a oneplus 7pro and i was happy but oneplus doesnt provide type c to 3.5 mm jack.. i have managed by not having audio jack in phone but why didnt u give the connector in the box content.. I was vry disappointed with oneplus... I have paid 49k for a phone and i didnt get a type c to 3.5 mm jack connector!! This is vry disappointing..\\n\\n \\n\\n  Everything is great about the phone except for a few things.1. Due to curved edged screen, touching at undesired points becomes eminent, which leads to opening apps randomly which I don\\'t want to.2. Adobe Acrobat Reader Pro gets stuck if the file size is beyond 2 MB, even with 8 MB RAM!3. Screen guard which comes with the phone by default, is of quite poor quality. Mine got worn and torn within first 3 weeks.But apart from the above, the phone\\'s performance, battery, camera, sound, speed - everything is just great! Despite the minor flaws, I am loving this one!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Ok first let me tell you something. All the negative reviews are before the OTA update. So if you are wondering whether to buy it or not, don\\'t think again. This mobile is a beast.Pro\\'sTop class displayNo notchesVery Good battery. Getting 7.5 hrs SOT with 90hz+ QHDStereo Speakerssplash resistantOxygen OS (I am sure it will go till Android 12)Super fast indisplay Finger print scannerCon\\'sNo headphone jack. Not even converter provided. I thought there will be one.Pretty Okish Camera. Hoping for some good OTA updates.No LED notification lightFinally Camera to Api is enabled. So install Gcam and it will do wonders.\\n\\n \\n\\n  If there\\'s one thing that caught my eye when my colleague bought this phone is the display. It was a stunning 2k+ Quad HD display after all. It then lead me to look for video reviews from the youtube experts. It turns out, they did appreciate the display and phone. It\\'s amongst the best displays on a phone in recent times and it\\'s a Samsung panel.Pros of this phone:1. Ultra smooth beautiful quad hd screen with a 90 Hertz display. It is 6.67 inches in size including the curved edges. It\\'s great for social media,videos which can render in 1440p if available and for reading too. It also does not have a notch and you pretty much love it.2. Battery life with a 4000 MAH battery is great when you consider that you use a 90 Hz refresh vivid qhd screen. Your could switch to 60 Hz but nah. :)3. Back cameras do a good job in capturing pics. An yet to really test them. The front 16 mp pop up camera works well. It\\'s a good camera setup.4. It\\'s got the SD 855 processor and it\\'s butter smooth and fast.5. With the oxygen OS, it delivers near stock Android experience. It will very soon be upgraded to 10.6. Warp charging: it\\'s got crazy fast charging compared to op6 which I have before this and 90% will get your through the day and more.7. The on screen finger print sensor is great to use.Cons:1. It\\'s a heavy phone at 200 grams. You will take a week to get used to it since we all are so adaptive.2. It\\'s got a curved display with curved edges. Accidental Ghost touches do occur from time to time. Also, your need to be careful. If you drop it face down, it will fall on the screen side given its weight and with the curved edges, there is a chance to break.3. With the launch of the OP7t, One plus has diluted the significance of this phone. We Indians are price conscious and the OP 7t costs 7k lower than each of the OP 7 pro models even after prices dropped on the 7 plus pro (OP 7 pro costs 4k lesser than when launched 6 months ago).Update: just found that there\\'s a One Plus 7t Pro launching on October 10th 2019. With it, this will be definitely be the undisputed OP Flagship.4. For the price, no type C to 3.5 mm jack connector in the box, no type C ear phones, no wireless charge, no waterproof certification but you do get a case.Verdict:If you want the great screen, FHD+ 2K+ display, 90 Hz refresh and notch less design, go for the one plus pro. If you want most of what pro has, a balanced phone, some additional features and are ok with the 2k display and notch screen design, go for One plus 7t which is a super budget flagship killer too.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very bad service of amazon there is no content service .There is a option to call but no one call me .Sepaker hv problem sometimes . Suddenly Stop working.Ppl Complan that thr is some eco or damage voice and n mic .Please help\\n\\n \\n\\n  So I changed from iOS to Android ,previously used iPhone 8 what a great phone it was no complaints coming to one plus 7pro at first I was apprehensive about this phone whether to buy or not after thinking a lot finally bought this one , I don\\'t use camera that much so issues there , finger print scanner has small issues but it\\'s okay , coming to screen larity it is the best . Over all it\\'s a good phone for one year use .. rest is best ..\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was skeptical on whether to buy it or not but ended up buying it. I was not expecting much but it surprised me because of it\\'s blazing fast speed and excellent performance. I recommend you guys to buy it. You will not be disappointed\\n\\n \\n\\n  Phone is simply Superb. Camera, screen, speed, quality and look and feel.Only area of improvement is battery. But yeah, with this performance you won\\'t be disappointed with buying a power bank for this phone.And Warp charging is soooooper fast.\\n\\n \\n\\n  i face many problems and getting frustrated because of  many issue likealthough big ram but still it hangs . touch pad working automatically even after screen lock...the screen lock is not working and you can unlock with only one up swap...and automatically dailed numbers....\\n\\n \\n\\n  Starting with the camera quality, the phone takes gorgeous pictures. Within three weeks, OnePlus has send more than three updates centered on the camera and it gets better and better. Photos are sharp, colors a bit vibrant but I love it, video quality is better than any phone. Portraits are somewhat average, but that is true for any smartphone. Selfies too are of very good quality, and support nightscape.In very low light (almost pitch black with a few lights in the distance) the phone performed better than my expectations but I rarely use it for such situations. In normal low light (clubs, dimly lit rooms) it performs very well. I have attached a lot of camera samples. The best part about the OnePlus 7 Pro is the sharp quad HD display and with the 90Hz display, you can\\'t stop just scrolling through your phone because it\\'s so smooth and addictive. Everything from 4k videos to just the wallpapers look mesmerizing on this phone. The chin of the phone is also almost non existent, like the iPhone X.The fingerprint reader is very fast but takes more than one try with wet hands.The battery lasted much longer than the reviews said, easily finishing one day (and more than one with moderate usage and the battery saver turned on).The performance is just mind-numbingly fast. I realised its importance while opening PayTm which would always open slowly on my previous phone. No lag whatsoever.OxygenOS is a big reason to consider this phone because it is much better than the OneUI or Oppo/Vivo\\'s wierd UIs.The only complaint I have is that OnePlus did not include a headphone jack converter in the box and the official converter on their website is out of stock. I tried a few cheap converters but sound quality was very bad. This is a trick for me to buy their new Bluetooth earphones WHICH I WILL NOT.Anyway the speaker quality is very very rich and good with Dolby Atmos so I can manage till I buy a pair of other Bluetooth earphones.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I would like to thanks One plus for launching this amazing mobile..camera is awesome , beyond expectation.. especially the night mode.. battery back is good..touch screen is like butter...overall I will suggest this is best smart phone I have ever seen around me..I am sharing this after using around 15 days...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Dislay-Great 90hz QHD+ AMOLED display5/5Camera- It is good but struggles in tricky situation especially in low light but still its 4/5 on camera department.UI - 1000000/5Sound- Loud and clear but bass is little off 4.5/5Battery- It hogs a lot of battery. You need to carry that WARP Charger around if you want to last a day if you watch a lot of YouTube/Netflix or play games. Otherwise for a typical user it would last a day 3/5.Charging Speed - 10/5\\n\\n \\n\\n  3 things :-1 Camera - Camera is like 15000 phone Ka Ho, Camera is not What i expected after spending so much..2 - Fingerprint - Sometime it irritates!!  im like Bhai Bhool Gya kya mujhe..3 - Not Feature rich like Samsung s10plusNow If you like Speed then Go for it, But Camera is where 1+ has to do Something & i m shocked that this phone doesn\\'t have 960fps slowmo!!!  Thats why im saying 30000 is okay for this phone.. & Guys It is Heavy Brick so be prepared.. Charging is Really fast, Screen is Awesome, 855 Dragon is Does the job.. But still i wont suggest this phone unless u get it below 30000..Thank you\\n\\n \\n\\n  I got my first OnePlus 7 pro after a week it\\'s launched but the Pop up camera not working properly... so I requested Amazon and theyvsent someone for inspection. After that when this defect is confirmed, I got my mobile on 2 nd day.. Thanks Amazon for responding so fast.After one successful replacement I finally got my phone. One plus 7 pro is one of it\\'s kind. No comparison..... Video quality and stability mind blowing.... Camera quality decent... Touchscreen works like charm.... U will understand after using it.... Screen - OMG! really appreciate this approach.After having blazing fast processor and amazing fluid amoled screen i am pretty impressed that it stays long enogh ... Almost 18 to 20 hours... I playbpubg, watching videos on YouTube and Amazon prime.... Though its give very decent battery life....After 1 month of full usage I can say proudly that I am satisfied with this product. A bit disappointed on OnePlus for not adding the type C to 3.5 mm jack. But overall its a mobile worth of 50k....\\n\\n \\n\\n  One major drawback is that you cannot make folders inside the apps screen. Whats the point in spending 60k when you cannot even organise your work. Everytime you go to apps screen , just try finding the app you are looking for. Also amazon just replaces and doesnt allows us to return the phone. Never buy in my recommendation.......go for samsung note 10 instead......\\n\\n \\n\\n  Mobile is awesome, Its very handy, beautiful in hand, superb in speed and best camera used so far. If you look for some smart device in your hand, fastest speed and you like quality photography. Oneplus 7pro is the device.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The best phone ever...videos in YouTube wit 1080 so real it can go beyond that...camera amazing shots... about camera shots it has every single bit of clearity when u capture...just need to dig into the settings part...I\\'m in love love love love love with my one plus 7pro nebula colour..it\\'s amazing... performance n everything lots to say...but this is the best ever phone for next future...catch me if u can settle hahaha...cos m settled already..\\n\\n \\n\\n  1 star for Amazon not to phoneDon\\'t buy on NO COST EMI else you will regret on your decision. I bought it on No cost now I am paying EMI og 9127‚Çπ per month with 800‚Çπ tax and gst.Overall I am playing 9927‚Çπ for 6 months that means I will pay them 59,562‚ÇπThat was a biggest nightmare in my life.Phone is awesome but price manipulation was also awesome\\n\\n \\n\\n  Not impressed at all with OnePlus 7 pro (12GB RAM) Other than night mode picture quality.Cons-- Phone heats up while playing the game and this not what I expected for a 12 GB RAM, RAM size is literally a waste of money.-- Phone is bulky fat and heavy does not fit in all kind of pant pockets.--  Battery life is worse than my previous OnePlus 5T I regret giving away my 5T for this.ProsNight mode picturesNotch less full-size display.My OnePlus 5T was a lot better than this I will not buy a OnePlus again better by a Samsung. or Huawei.  I believe this no much difference with OnePlus 7T either. I wanted to return it but the policy won\\'t let me do that, not impressed Amazon, I regret not reading Amazon return policy before buying.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone has disappointed me on various fronts. I have 8Gb and 256 Gb variants. Despite being the higher end of it\\'s offering, it doesn\\'t perform up to its standard. It hangs very often even while single-tasking. It\\'s a shame on One Plus that even their camera doesn\\'t respond while clicking the pictures. Their customer support is neither responsive not agile. They still are very parochial in their approach and it\\'s better to go for some brand that listens to their customers.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was using 1plus 3T from last 2.5 years and I was satisfied with it. I was happy that I am upgrading my phone with 1plus 7pro which I have heard about a lot but my expectations were shattered when I used its camera. The camera quality is very poor as compared to what has been shown in the launch event. I am very disappointed with it as my main purpose to buy this phone is because of its camera. It\\'s battery life is also just OK as I have to charge it on frequently basis\\n\\n \\n\\n  Fastest Android mobile in market..it has its own flaws however the positives covers them up..Pros:1. Design2. Screen and refresh rate3. Battery life4. Stereo speakers5. Oxygen OS6. PERFORMANCE7. CHARGINGCONS:1. Camera it\\'s not bad at all but does not meet expectation.2. No 3.5 mm headphone jack or adapter3. Finger print reader works 9/10 times but with wet fringers you simply cannot login4. Pricing (should have been competitive)Overall it\\'s a near flagship which ticks almost all the boxes but disappoints with the camera...Fastest Android with great display and special mention about 90hz screen... In my opinion this is a futuristic mobile ...\\n\\n \\n\\n  First of all thanks for choosing me as ur review handle!!So this phone is for those who have some big hands not for the small hands...[ Overall review of OnePlus 7 Pro ]‚àÜ Advantage‚Ä¢ As OnePlus said it\\'s truly a bezeless phone!‚Ä¢ It\\'s \"Beyonds the speed\"‚Ä¢ Nebula Color is Best !!‚Ä¢ Camera Is All Good!!‚Ä¢ Many thinngs Are Good !!‚àÜ Disadvantage‚Ä¢ At price of 53000/- in they should provide Headphone in box!!‚Ä¢ It\\'s a little Heavy as compare to other smartphone!‚Ä¢ No clean Cloth in Box!!‚àÜ Most important points!!‚Ä¢ 90 refresh rate is awesome üòç‚Ä¢ Battery Backup + Charging is Quick!!‚Ä¢ It Some time get a little hot maybe due to temp of 50* Celsius in Jodhpur!!So if u have a budget of 45000/-+ u should go with OnePlus 7 Pro and u will be satisfy at least 4 years!!√ó Compare √ó‚Ä¢ OnePlus 7 Pro is much better than Samsung S10+ & IPhone Xr which is much higher as compare to OnePlus in price!!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Such an awesome device.Looks : 10/10Performance: 10/10Camera: 9/10UI: 11/10NO DOUBT, this model will create some records.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Dream mobile,Got this by yesterday night.Solid build quality,display is butter smooth and cristal clear.Good üîãBest cameraFlagship specs with curved display under 50k.Practically best deal by comparing to competitors.#Blind purchase\\n\\n \\n\\n  One Plus 7 Pro is the  Best phone till date under one plus flagship.Well I think it has both Pro and Cons.I have listed them down as per my observation.Pro:1) Super Dispaly best in class and at this price.2) Battery backup is excellent.3) Camera is great please dont compare it with Samsung.Try the same in low light..4) Processor speed is superb with no heating issue .5)Quick charging and very fast clock speed.Cons:1) A bit heavy.2) No headphone jack.I had thought atleasy with this range of price they should provide us headphones and a Back cover.I think they have only reserved those things for Technical reviewers.If you see any technical review of the product they will get all accessories but a regular buyer won\\'t.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought the phone on 4 March 2020. This is the worst phone I have ever bought. Even though there are few good things such as display, camera but bat things out number good things. I have been facing many problems after 3 weeks of the purchase of phone.Problems I have been facing:1. My phone gets switched off when I recieve a call.  I have never heard this problem and never faced this  problem before. Also worst thing is I won\\'t know who  called me after I switch on my phone.2. Battery life:  When I recieved this phone, I was very happy with the  battery life. But after 6 weeks of usage, I have been  facing issues wirh the battery. For 2 hours usage of  Netflix, the battery consumption increased to 25-28  percent from 18-20 percent.3. Lagging:  I always keep my system up to date with system  updates. But sometimes my phone lags as if it has been  used for 2 years.4. OnePlus customer service:  I have contacted OnePlus customer service several  times, but none were able to solve my issues.At first I was very happy while I was using my phone, but now all I do is worry when I use my phone.I hope OnePlus will solve my phone problems. I would be very happy if OnePlus acknowledges my message.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Full 5 ‚ú≥Ô∏è.. also my 1st Oneplus...Touch sensibility 5/5Gaming 5/5Camera 4.5/5 (cartoon type pictures)Vibrator engine 5/5Screen ratio 5/5Battery backup 4/5 . (For 90hz refresh rate more power consumption)U have the bucks. Go for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  One plus is nothing more than a social media hype, the phone are generally coming with minor defects. I first ordered this and fingerprint reader came with defect after which I followed with amazon badly but got poor response. The phone was replaced in close to 7 days of time, the second phone also came with defect and it is heating up even over 45 degree while in normal usage and now it is a pain. Moreover amazon have very bad support on this. Polishing used on phone is also bad, after 10 days of normal usage scatches have appeared on phone not on glass back but on metal side of phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The screen size and viewing has just spoiled me.The bezeless screen with curved display is really to die for. I don\\'t know if I can ever go back from this screen to any other device now.The processing speed is really really good.It doesn\\'t slow down when it is dying in battery or if 4-5 apps are running in parallel. Processing is just flawless.When I was buying this phone, I was continuously told that camera is something u won\\'t like. However, to my surprise till now the images taken are just amazing.Really love the portrait mode and wide angle feature on this. So amazing.Overall mobile feels really premium in your hands.Must recommended buy if this comes under your budget.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought it for my friendCamera AwesomePerformance MindblowingLook ShinyPrice Not ok with thatFingerprint Very responsiveBattery life upto 8hrsBest in class camera\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been using this phone for almost 7months now, I upgraded from Nexus 6P and this is my first oneplus phone.The screen is excellent and it is the biggest USP of this phone. It is a breeze to use this phone, UI is uncluttered and minimalist.However, the worst part of this phone is FINGERPRINT SCANNER which ruins the entire experience of using the phone. They snapped on a half baked technology called optical fingerprint scanner, more than 50% time it doesn\\'t work. I tried multiple times deleting and enrolling again, it did not improve. It is not that it doesn\\'t work but it is unpredictable when it won\\'t work. Imagine you try to unlock the phone using finger and it doesn\\'t work on repeated attempts and you have to finally enter the PIN to unlock the phone. Imagine having this repeat 15-20 times a day !! All this with a clean thumb, if you got wee bit of dust or dirt on your finger, just forget it !!. For example, after you open your car door and get in, I can guarantee that the phone unlock wont work, a little bit of dust on the door handle is enough to kill this. I am truly frustrated with this, my nexus 6P had physical scanner on the back and it never failed; instant unlock every single time, may be it didn\\'t work once in a million attempts.To circumvent this problem, I can\\'t use face unlock either! because this has got a pop up camera that needs to pop up do a face unlock, the phone throws a warning if you retract the pop up camera a few times. I originally intended to keep the phone for 3 years but now I am so frustrated that I am looking to move to a Samsung or something better.\\n\\n \\n\\n  So been using it for a week and a half or so ,here\\'s the layman review the kind I would\\'ve wanted to read here in the review sectionPro\\'s-SCREEN- so good you\\'ll find it hard to keep the phone away from you for even a little while .It\\'s butter like crazy smooth.DISPLAY- be it qhd or fhd things are way above par a premium experience warm and subtle bright colors soothe your eyes enhanced by the resolution options offered by the phone . It\\'s \\'For your eyes only \\'.CHARGE- it\\'s \\'warping\\' fast I charge my phone at 5% mark and 30 minutes later it is 65 % so the One plus did good on the promise . The brick is beast of a charging plug.REFRESH RATE - ITS 90 Hz or nothing that\\'s how fantastic that refresh is . 60Hz doesn\\'t disappoint either  , the difference between the two is not too much but you definitely feel surfing a wave while sliding down and up it\\'ll be a whole new time pass .lolCAMERA- nightscape mode and normal photo mode are super cool crisp and subtle pics to impress anyone . The pop up selfie camera gives a clean and cool selfie . So pop it like you work itOthers- no heating issues did play pubg on 90 Hz and qhd lasted me 3.5 hrs on what was the best pubg experience thus far . The only reason i reinstalled pubg after quitting it last year was to check the limits of the specs offered by the phone and it superceded it in everyway possibleCONS-BATTERY- 90 Hz and qhd will take a toll on your phone .battery life is disappointing kind of but given high end specs you get at this price plus the warp charge I think the company made its warp charging knowing that .With high end spec it lasts about 4-5 hrs extensive use like gamingWith 90hz and fhd about 5-6 he extensive to moderate use .60 hz and fhd -5-7.5 hrs with extensive to moderate useHANDLING-depends on your hands me being a 6\\'3 didn\\'t find it difficult at all.CAMERA- even after the update the portrait mode is disappointing depth effect has played a spoil sport .NO DONGLE(SCREW YOU ONE PLIS FOR THAT ;). )NO HEADPHONE JACK (DOUBLE SCREW YOU)Overall go for it just the best experience this flagship has to offer in range of 49k to 53 k .NOTE - DO NOT REMOVE THE GLASS ON THE SCREEN THAT IS THERE BY DEFAULT IT IS THE BEST ONE YOU\\'VE GOT FOR A LONG WHILE WILL DO JUSTICE\\n\\n \\n\\n  Do not peel off original screen protector that comes with phone.. reason is currently no screen guards are available and most of glass screen protectors dont work..Rest of the things as you already know.One less star because I received the piece with one noticeable scratch on the screen.Over all worth buying for sure.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Where do i start! Ok one week down the lane, this phone to begin with looks spectacular, atleast from the screen and display point of view i dont know what could better this now. Next up, The 90hz refresh rate makes your phone feel buttery and you will love it(comes at a negotiable cost of reduced battery life) . It\\'s alright though since it\\'s powered with a WARP charger that works like a charm. Talking about cameras now, pop-up camera adds to the elligence of this phone. The picture qulities are stunning at times. I have tried macro photo graphy with this one and the details it can catch are just terrific to believe. 4k recording is excellent, stability is alright!! At this price (42k) it\\'s almost unreal as to what this phone has to offer. Nebula blue color makes this gadget look like out of this planet. Let\\'s not even get into specification. Because it\\'s all just \"beyond the speed\". One amazing product!!\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first OnePlus DeviceAnd I can say this is the best phone I have ever used .The 90hz display is amazingI can guarantee once you started using the phone on 90hz you can\\'t go back to lower refresh rate.. you will feel and can see the other phones lagging..Camera is not up to the mark but the latest update improve a lot .. and can be better in next updates..Battery life is good ... Not the best due to higher refresh rate and quad hd resolution.. but if you want good battery life you can do so by changing the screen resolution to full HD+ and the refresh rate to 60hz..The fingerprint is super fast..And the WARP Charge , this is amazing..The phone charges very quickly..Oxygen Os is awsm.. (best os ever)Weight - the phone is a lit bit heavy.. but if you use the case you wont feel it heavy..\\n\\n \\n\\n  Speakers are good. Screen is good.But performance is getting worse.. Multitasking is impossible, if i open a notification and go back to previous opened app it starts all over again. Mi phones have better multi tasking than this i felt.If i get a phone call, and go back to opened app same happens.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Pro & Cons for One Plus 7Pro:-Pros:1. I am a great fan of One Plus and i have been using one plus5 from last 2 year so there is no question of phone getting lagging issue or anything like that, but when i received my One Plus 7Pro lagging word is simply unavailable in my dictionary.2. About fingerprint scanner it is quiet good but just hopping to be little faster, (Personal opinion) may be it is because of on display scanner some micro seconds delayed would be there.3. Popup camera is best in class, face recognition is simply awesome.4. Battery backup is ok you get whole-day utilization time if you are a frequent user.5. Last thing the built quality & design is simply awesome. One has to be only careful for accidentally dropping on backside & on display corners because of it curve display.Cons:-1. No headphone jack 3.5mm one has to buy c-type converter or c-type headphone.2. Its very difficult to put tempered glass for curve screen mobiles i have tried twice perfect fitting is impossible.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Let\\'s start with the first thing that you would notice - size.It\\'s a big phone, yeah. But, after 2 weeks you won\\'t notice. It will feel just perfect in hand (if you don\\'t use a cover on this). With a cover, it\\'s still alright. And yeah, I\\'ve been using Galaxy S7 and Lg G7, meaning small phones, always. So yeah, size won\\'t bother you and it feels as premium as a phone can get.Next, Display - I compared the display to S10, S10 Plus, Note 9, Pixel, iPhone. I love this display in every aspect. Everything will always look better. Maybe because of the larger size or actual display quality, I don\\'t know. It\\'s the best I\\'ve had. Outdoor visibility is a little less (only when you compare with others), but it will get the job done easily.Battery - Do not go through online review. It\\'ll last a full day easily on heavy use. I\\'m getting a day and a half - 4 hrs Sot with 32-38 hrs or 7+ hours sot on weekends with a 18-22 hrs standby. Even it doesn\\'t; You won\\'t ever feel it. Charges in no time, Doesn\\'t heats up while charging (even when you\\'re using it). It\\'s getting better after each day.Camera - Again, getting better after each update. I\\'m on android 10 open beta preview and you get all the features that you want. Every function enabled on each sensor. Default setting is great, detailed images, perfect balance. And, when you want to tweak, Pro mode is there. You don\\'t need anything else when it comes to cameras. Btw, when comparing the pictures between S10 and 7 Pro, you\\'ll like the 7 pro just cause of the display.Performance - Do I really need to review this? Just cut the animation scale to 0.5x in developer mode and it feels crazy. Not a single hiccup so far. This is the best performer in the industry.You won\\'t get better experience than this. You may buy other flagships because you though the camers might be better or battery or blah blah. This the best thing in the market right now. Or, just wait for the 7T pro. 1 months maybe. Best thing ever.But, get a framless cover for 500, it will maintain the sleek feel of the phone. Don\\'t try any uv screenguards, they are horrible. Use the stock screenguard or simple protectors.Cheers!\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is super amazing.. It is a little heavy compared to other models from One Plus but that\\'s not a complaint as the phone is real fast with great and simple features.. The finger print scanner is not that great as most of the times I have to input my password due to lockage from trying several times. I think they need to work a lot on this.. Camera quality is super good and even the night pictures turn out to be fabulous.Has a great battery life.. Based on my usage I\\'m getting around 12-15 hours.. But I need not to worry as the phone charges super quick.!Initially there were a few call drops but I think the issue is fine now..The best part about the phone is it\\'s speakers! Dolby surround is just out of the World and you get a theater experience while watching videos or even music for that matter..OnePlus could have provided some basic headphones with this phone as it does not have a jack.. But i think you can get a good wireless headphone for around 2000 which will solve your problem..\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was littlebit sceptical after reading some genera and negative reviews about it on the amazon as well as on YouTube...but after i used for 2 days ...i am loving it... camera has gone better after latest update ...and.....and this thing is pure Butter. Go for it....Best in its  class....not regretting a penny in 49k i spent....no issues yet\\n\\n \\n\\n  Waited 5 year to buy new phone after using Samsung note 3.Can say it was worth waiting.With this price tag and feature I consider this as perfect purchase.Main feature.Screen A+Speed SD 855Looks..even mirror grey look perfect90hz refresh rateBatteryDisappointedCameraScreen is quiet large\\n\\n \\n\\n  The worst experience. You can\\'t play heavy games like PUBG and COD and even use Youtube for a long time because there comes over heating! They say there is a cooler inside.. But. I don\\'t feel so. Screen keeps freezing while I play games due to this heating problem. Other apps keep closing automatically! I couldn\\'t even share pics via WhatsApp cuz it started to load the pic forever! Still my hands are heating.. Never ever buy this crap.. go for a Samsung seriously.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Was waiting for a good deal on S10, meanwhile OP7Pro was launched so I bought it on the first day it started selling, Amazon delivered the same day. Great service. I received and installed 2 updates, and having used it for a week plus, I can say it\\'s been a mixed experience. Some features work well, others dont. So here\\'s my impression for you.Good:1. Large and sharp LED screen with good legibility. Watching videos is fun. The on screen FP sensor is fast and conveniently located, no delays or misses.2. Dual speakers with clear sound, though music quality through speakers is just about OK.3. Fast and zippy, be it apps, games or file transfers. Doesnt get hot while playing games or charging4. Really fast charging. Fully charged in an hour!5. Oxygen OS is minimal and easy to use. The popup selfie camera is quicker than I expected.6. Haptic feedback is very refined. I used to turn it off on phones. On this one, it\\'s on.The bad:1. The curved edges make it more slippery and the image on the edges reflect and appear distorted, any element there is hard to touch. Collects fingerprint marks easily. I dont find the missing notch makes any huge difference in my usage.2. There is no headphone socket on the phone, no USB-C headphone or adapter in the box3. The selfie camera is average, The rear triple camera setup isnt great as advertised. The main camera is good but gives inconsistent results.The Ugly1. Handling the phone because of it\\'s weight, size and top heaviness, slipperiness.2. Battery life is a shame for a 4000mAh. Bringing down refresh rate and screen resolution made it a bit better, but it\\'s still a one day phone at best.3. Wide angle lens is low on detail, not too wide yet creates distortion4. Not VFM at this price. Its should have been 6-8k cheaper for that.My impression is, this is a phone that only huge screen lovers should go for. The rest should wait for OP7, check if its battery life isnt as bad as this, and go for 8/256 version, still saving 11k over oneplus 7 pro. Else wait for s10/s10+ discount sale. I regret I didnt wait for S10 to be discounted.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Bang for the buck, superb design, top quality speaker, fantastic camera, just one drawback no 3.5mm headphone jack, but expect that  FANTASTIC DEAL\\n\\n \\n\\n  With standard use the phone simply died within a month form purchase. Something that you don\\'t expect with a 52k flagship. I have logged a ticket with support and only the resolution they provide may help change the rating..\\n\\n \\n\\n  though the phone is heavily loaded but there are certain things which it lacks and is required by most of the common users. having a high camera setup the phone still gives you an ok image which when compared to other flag ships is way less quality wise. i felt for such high end phones 4000mah battery is less, though 7 pro gives you decent 1 and half day back up on normal usage but same back gets reduced to a day or less on extensive usage. last but the most important is the head phone jack,  i was expecting one plus would provide c to 3mm jack connector like they did in case of one plus 6 and 6t. strange thing is they don\\'t have enough inventory of the same.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is a beast. I switched for iPhone to one plus. Not sure if you\\'ll find a phone this fast and smooth. The 90hz is a treat to scroll through, you will feel the difference after using this phone and then switching to a different phone with a basic 60hz. The experience is just wonderful. The fingerprint even though is fast it\\'s not necessarily consistent you\\'ll sometimes need to keep trying to unlock the phone and the camera is decent at most, does the job most of the time. Video watching experience is absolutely wonderful, great battery life, you can expect a whole day even with considerable usage. Absolutely worth the money\\n\\n \\n\\n  I got a faulty product delivered and it was promptly repalced by the service center, good people at Chennai (Masood) and Bangalore (Anirudh) Service Centre. Overall the Phone is performing as expected worth the money spent. I am happy that one plus is backed by good service center executives.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0Display is just smooth and so captivating you can actually play videos of 60 fps & 120 fps on this on full screen mode and the Dolby digital sounds is just crystal clear and the fanatic mode i don\\'t if it\\'s available on lower variants but being the 12 gb variant I must say it is the most powerfull device for gaming, photography, videos , performance, you name it\\n\\n \\n\\n  Product is awesome but delivery was delayed.the first thing you\\'ll notice is that it is blazing fast. The camera pops up everytime for facial unlock which looks a little bothering somehow otherwise this phone is power packed. Battery life will go on for more than a day for me easily with daily chores on my phone as I am not a gamer.\\n\\n \\n\\n  First of all, Let\\'s talk about Negative FirstI should say that Oneplus Copied the Design from Samsung and This truly looks like S9 or something like that, its edge Display is the worst implementation, Overall Designiis good, but coming to Screen its really annoying why Oneplus opted for this. Who want a curved display..? If some one wants they will buy a Samsung.2. Weight if the product, it\\'s really heavy this is also may be because if copying from Samsung.3. Warp Charger, it\\'s to make us fools, really, when Charging Oneplus 6T and 7Pro, we surely notice that warp charger is another normal oneplus charger as both charges at same speed, what\\'s the use of warp Circuit..? Still the speed is decent enough but not satisfactory for its name.4. Popup Camera, Of course Design wise it is an asset, but if Safety of Camera Considered then Popup camera takes out the points. If course they shown some circus tricks by weighing some stone to it, but they never shown how many times the motor can handle up and down of it..? If you use face unlock, that little thing pops up minimum 50 times a day and in long run.. Can it withstand..?Here Punch Hole Display is true Winner.Now coming to positives.1. Excellent Display, if we eliminate that edge Display fi a while and feel the 90hz Fluid AMOLED Display, then we really feel the smoothness of it, just like butter, and the Delivery of saturation, whites everything is natural and with vivid option it looks astonishing.2. Both Front and Rear Cameas work like pro, front camera gives pics with over Sharpness may be issue with resolution, but after processing they are good. Coming to Rear Camera, wide angle lens are not Doing its job perfectly, may be software issue, but still Potrait or normal works great, Quality is too good.3. In screen Fingerprint works really great, fast and no need to search for sensor.4. Battery Life, With Heavy Usage, 8hrs, with Moderate Usage,16hrs, with Normal Usage, 20+ hours and I got more than 48 hours of life with Light Usage. Battery backup is Decent when we combine all the draining factors like 6.6 inch Display, In Screen Finger Print, Quad HD Display, 90hz Refresh Rate and all.5. NO need to say about Performance, 855 processor says it all.Overall, It\\'s a beast with some Drawbacks and I personally feel Oneplus crossed its limits by pushing its flagship killer mark to Flagship Competitor, Oneplus itself bought its destruction, sooner or later its greediness to takeover the market makes it vulnerable and make it extinct, I think this is my Last Oneplus Device as surely they will go beyond 60k from next mobile.They say some Quality Comes with a price to pay..My question is why can\\'t this be applied to Samsung and Apple when Oneplus introduced Oneplus One..?Am writing This review after using the mobile for 4 days.Thank you.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am a OnePlus device die hard fan. This is my 5th OP handset. OP 1,OP 2,OP 3, OP 5 and now the fully upgraded OP 7 Pro. The best part is OnePlus has at last listened to the customer demand and tried to fulfil almost every aspact except few which are not mandtory or deal breaker. OnePlus is OnePlus and no body can beat the performance, charging durability, updates etc.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Monster phone with build in powerhouse in this budget.Great flagship killer mobile with Awesome look in this price range, i will not explain more about the specification bcoz its already mentioned in descriptionbut as per my personal experience i love very much this mobile phone compare to other Android devices.In Term of Battery this is wonderful and with Dash charging this gives an extra advantage.In Term of Performance this is Beast\\n\\n \\n\\n  Finally I could lay my hand on the Almost perfect high end smartphone,let me explain...Delivery-Superfast one day between the order and my possession, inference- I would suggest oneplus to be Amazon exclusive,they are doing their best for the buying experience of OnePlus products, actually I went to Reliance digital calicut they had no proper stock on the launch week and they were unware of any offers on OnePlus simply horrible experience.Unboxing-This is my first OnePlus phone my previous phone was Apple iPhone xs I was reluctant a bit before unboxing but boy I literally loved it when I laid my hands on this beast,few words from my initial experience,the tactile feel on the back of the phone is something which I have never experienced till date it\\'s a sort of butterly silky matte gradient blue which you should experience to believe it,it\\'s a hot looking phone specially in this nebula blue colour second only to oppo Reno ocean green which I feel is the hottest looking smartphone of this season,build quality is impeccable worthy of a flagship,few things about accessories Travel Adaptor is very huge will be a sore thing to carry around but charges at blazing speeds,Good quality flashy red data cable,an above average pausible soft back case which fits perfectly with some of not full protection,Some people had said in their review about airbubles under screen gaurd and poor application of the screen gaurd and all which had put worries in my mind but trust me guys it\\'s so very professionally put which I would bet you can\\'t get it done anywhere near it by a local screen gaurd vendor even upon microscopic examination I couldn\\'t find any air bubbles or imperfections.User Experience-in just one word it\\'s awesome,which none of the Android flagships could dare promising it to their fans at twice the cost of this phone,with just one update till date no issues at all, battery life is very good even after setting the display for 90hz,and boy 90hz display you should experience to believe it, scrolling,navigating everything is buttey smooth because of this 90hz,the fastest 256gb storage on any smartphone till date is blazing fast,Audio is good but not the best,Camera is again Good but not the best but livable,only one last and important thing I missed from OnePlus is the good quality type c earphone as I couldn\\'t find a good qualityone on any online sites but no gripes,the pricing by OnePlus erases every little blemishes clearly to leave a Champion on this arena,thanks OnePlus and Amazon love you both.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have seen plenty of reviews with praises on the phone\\'s hardware or the software. And both are awazing. An apple like integration of hardware and software. A beast at its heart. Enough RAM to handle multiple apps without a hiccup. No heating issues. Long battery life. Brilliant screen. What more do you need?My shout-out to the Oneplus team that is working non-stop on improving the user experience. In less than 2 month, I have received 4 updates that resolved a few initial bugs only cos they are listening to us and working on the feedback.Own one to see how they keep customers at the top of their priority list.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Of all the things on one plus, the fluidity of the display is a must mention. However from a software perspective, one must mention, the oxygen os tops everything I have used. Minimally intrusive, maximally productive. The touches are thoughtful and subtle. One plus adheres to the Android design philosophy and adds functionality that one needs. No unnecessary bloat from functionality that I would use an app for. The migrate app is awesome. The features one feels are the ones that Android would absorb in the future. Similar to what Motorola promised before Lenovo started killing it off.\\n\\n \\n\\n  some people says camera is not good. But its camera is excellent even in low light.  It has too many pro setting, not for General public, its for professionals. performance is good, Giving 60mbps (Mega bit per second) speed on Airtel 4G. By speed test. Don\\'t think much just go ahead and buy.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Display and battery is poor.no update is available for this device,still running on oxygen os 9 and Android 9.device is slow and overall performance is not good.This device is overpriced.oneplus customer care could not ensure about any software update but as per my knowledge this device should now run on Android 10.as per device last security update was received in April 2019 .\\n\\n \\n\\n  Amazing screen best screen right now.Smoothness in every interaction.Very fast.Good haptic feedbackBest Android experience.simple and cleanAverage battery life.gets through the day with auto brightness ,always on 4g and 5:30 min screen on time.Too heavyToo bigNot suitable for small or one handed operation.Finally best multimedia consumption.If you want best experience in watching videos playing games.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone competes with the big flagships at the cost of their budget flagships. Pretty decent camera, super snappy and fluid user experience. Fast in display fingerprint scanner and the battery life takes a hit at 90 Hz refresh rate but is excellent at 60 Hz. Also the warp charge is excellent. Oxygen OS is again very smooth being close to vanilla Android. Excellent Display, great camera, fast charging, powerful chipset should do your bidding.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I tell u an honest review,This phone is not a phone,it\\'s a luxury in ur hand,mind blowing performance,best in the segment, every photo wallpaper anything u see in this phone looks mesmerizing, wat else u ecxpect from a phone Yar,go for it blindly.This review  I\\'m posting after 20 days of using.Battery backup is superb,if u put the screen for 60hz.Display is best no cons in it.Processor...do I need to remind u it\\'s one plus?No doubt the best speed and processor.Camera ..yes here it\\'s ur personal choice I can\\'t really say it does the best but yes for me ..it\\'s more than enough yaar...I mean after Snapseed all photos are classic, don\\'t expect to replace this camera from ur DSLR. üòÑüòÑBody...yes keep it secured back glass is delecate ,always prone for the scratched and even cracks.Charging ...wrap charger the best of all very quick speed ,no issues of heating till now.I\\'m not a game lover so...can\\'t say much about it..Honestly if I say...then don\\'t go for costly I phones and Samsung sets even not with Huawei, go for this cream yaar...u and yr generations will enjoy the class of one plus.Thanks all .\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been a big fan of One plus phones as I have been using it for past many years but this new purchase has been quite shocking. On receiving the box we have the same excitement but this time the phone would not get \\'on\\' and show a set up software problem as seen in the screen shot uploaded. This is really frustrating that a phone of this cost will even fail to start , what to say of other features. It seems that the quality of these phones have taken a serious beating. I have requested for replacement. The company must look into such problems as they are very irritating and will dent their image severely.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have some minor issue with this phone. Firstly the screen guard. The phone is 45K+ but the inbuilt screen guard was as cheap as hell plastic guard. Got so many scratches after 2-3 days of minimum usage to the point where it doesn\\'t feels like it was bought a week ago. Don\\'t bother selling a phone worth 45K and no proper screen guard.Secondly, the touch doesn\\'t reponds sometimes. I have to close the apps and then it starts working again and it\\'s really frustrating.Thirdly, the Bluetooth stops working sometimes too when you want to share some files.Fourthly, the camera. It\\'s not as good as I expected it to be. 48MP but the quality is not there. Shouldn\\'t the pictures be more defined and detailed.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Except for display there isn\\'t any stand out feature. I was one among so called \\'community\\' user who got fooled.The goodDisplay display displayThe badCamera ( blind while shooting in night)Microphone ( deaf)The UglyWorld heavyweight championPoor finger print reader ( not secure)Let\\'s forget about waterproofing, fast charge gimmicks.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Love the phone.. Display is gorgeous. I am not very particular with the camera but still it\\'s good in day light shots. Haptic feedback is very good. Easy to use the alert slider.While setting up the phone with data transfer from old phone felt the temperature was high even though there is liquid cooling system. But then it\\'s only one time process and never felt the heat later.It\\'s very huge and heavy. After using this phone and when used my old OnePlus 5T I could feel how thick and heavy this phone is compared to 5T which is so slim. I think OnePlus has to reduce the weight of the phone and also reduce the size to 5.5 inches fire another category of users.\\n\\n \\n\\n  first time when i on this phone it show system not responding dialog and when i call amazon then send technician and technician do hard reset that phone then it is working but today(25 july 2020) exact after one month phone off automatically its not getting onSo i suggest don\\'t buy one plus ever bcz they make fool to customers.#worst phone ever#not value for money\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was just as excited as anyone buying this model of Oneplus. It is very fluid but the screen difference is not that noticable. The system performs quite well and attention to small details make it feel nice. The OS as such doesn\\'t have any new feature since android, i think is reaching its limit. So the performance tuning is wat is concentrated on and that has been adequately. Only major drawback i feel is in the department of the camera as it is not upto the mark. Initially at first glance it looks all nice and good, but the minute you start to zoom into it then it looks worthless. I wonder how DxO Mark rated it at 111??\\n\\n \\n\\n  I\\'ve spent the last 3 days using the 8GB variant OnePlus 7 Pro, and this is my favorite OnePlus phone to date.Pros‚Ä¢ Silky smooth and sharp AMOLED screen‚Ä¢ Powerful Performance‚Ä¢ Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos sound great‚Ä¢ Pop-up camera doesn\\'t feel gimmicky‚Ä¢ Responsive in-display fingerprint scanner‚Ä¢ Curved edges doesn\\'t distort content around the edges that much  unlike Samsung\\'s‚Ä¢ Decent low-light photos‚Ä¢ Great design and build quality‚Ä¢ impressive fast-charging battery (WARP charge)Cons‚Ä¢ No headphone jack‚Ä¢ little bit on the heavier side‚Ä¢ not so good battery life (when using display at 90Hz refresh rate)\\n\\n \\n\\n  Seamless navigation, good low-light images and above all wonderful OS. A real flagship-killer.You can always research,review and compare but unless you use this phone or see anyone using it,you just can\\'t comprehend the massive leap in class this phone brings in an average price-tag.Above all,you just can\\'t have the best of everything but you can come close to eternity...that\\'s OnePlus 7 Pro for you.Regarding delivery and packaging,Amazon never ceases to amaze and I candidly have never been so excited on seeing a package such smoothly arranged and sturdy being handed over.Besides, OnePlus has a tie-up with amazon.in and thus the product is genuine.(PS- Will add more images and a detailed review as I get time.)\\n\\n \\n\\n  There are lots of issues with one plus 7 pro.1. Camera(front & back) quality is not good. It doesnt even look like 20mp against 48mp.2. Battery -fully charged one is draining in half day(no new apps installed rather than in-built apps)Conclusion: Not worth Rs. 50000/,  Need Return\\n\\n \\n\\n  I\\'m using this device from last few days. Device is more or less ok. 1+ should enable super slowmotion in nex ot update. and camera quality is not good as they said... battery could be perform better if 1+ improve their os/app optimization very well. 1+ should provide headphone jack adapter in the box...\\n\\n \\n\\n  I\\'ve changed to different brand of phones...vivo, iPhone X, Xiaomi Poco F1...and my honest review is, this is the best Android smartphone, the best phone I\\'ve ever used. The display, sound, Refresh rate, camera and etc are just superb. Delivery was good and phone is in perfect condition. For those who want to buy, don\\'t hesitate... you should try be one of the family members of OnePlus family.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Earlier i used a oneplus 3t which was the best phone i bought that time....used it for almost 2.5 years,then decided to buy a latest phon from oneplus...pros and cons about 7 proPros-1.The display is mind blowing2.sd 855 ki super fast3.after few updates the phone works normally4.back glass looks awesome Cons1.the camera doesn\\'t feel up to the mark2.the overall design is a bit bulky for normal usage3.it is hard to find a perfect glass for this phone as the company doesn\\'t offer.4.no headphone jack and no connector provided inside the box.When i recived the phone i feel there was a fault in the touch screen sensitivity,also the fingerprint was slow.,after few updates both the problems were solved.still i believe the phone is a flagship from oneplus but fails against the flagship killers oneplus launched earlier times.I feel if u are ok with the bulky design..and want performance+gorgeous display just go for it,remember don\\'t ever use a glass with half glue on it as the touch problems may occure...go for full glue glass...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Heating problem is occurring in this device. Ghost touch and battery life is not good. OnePlus should provide type c headphone or a 3.5 mm audio jack. Price is too high but features are not so good. Night mode of is awesome but video recorder is so poor and limit on recording high quality videos.Dolby Atmos can attract anyone. Sound and display quality is best .But it\\'s not what OnePlus is known for.Price should be low.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Heavy weight .carv display r not better handy as samsung .camara 3rd class .price not worth this phone actually same as oppo vivo\\n\\n \\n\\n  One plus is a reputed brand in India but this new product has really disappointed me. I had 3t as the earlier model and it was a wonderful phone from day one for me. I was so excited to use one plus 7 pro but apart from the phone\\'s looks i liked nothing else. The camera quality does not match at all even with 6t. The touch and screen display cteates a lot of problem. On day two of using this phone, the screen suddenly turnee black. I was unable to unclock the phone or see any screen. All i could see was the clock display. And then the finger print sensors were displayed. I could not restart the phone as well for a long time. And i was traveling at that time which created a bigger problem for me. Compared to the price i paid, this phone is a big disappointment.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I had ordered a Nebula blue one plus 7 pro. Received the device on May 31st, delivery was done efficiently, Thank you Amazon.The Nebula blue device looks beautiful. Good work Oneplus.From two days of experience (will edit comment if anything new comes up):Pros:Everything in the news hold true -1. Good looking large screen - fun to use a truly full screen phone.2. Overall build of the phone is great - thought it would be too heavy (200gm) to use but it is not so.3. Battery does hold up for up to 1.5 days on a single charge (I\\'m a moderate user)4. Camera is decent. I currently switch between GCam and Default camera apps depending on what I\\'m shooting. Better to have both installed and available for your use.Cons:Again, the news holds true.1. Ghost touches: The issues reported on ghost touches does occur. But this happens only occasionally, does not bother you much.2: Weak speaker - when set to Max phone volume, it\\'s feels less pleasant to hear. Must ensure that it is not set at full volume.3. Phone hangs/stutters when re-used after a long break. Not sure if this is android\\'s fault or oneplus\\'Current verdict: This is one of the best phones out there, pricey but effective. Go for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  If u like to play very good quality games at smoothest rate with hdr graphics and u like lot of videos u can go aheadDownside camera us good not great ,it\\'s heavy and long in length no wireless charging and no ip ratingU can check Asus Zenfone 6z also before buying bc of value for money Asus is offering also please visit store and check the phone weight and balance if it comfortable u can go ahead else look for other options in market like one plus 7, Asus Zenfone 6z etcPerfect for hardcore gamers and one who enjoys watching Netflix or Amazon prime in hdrCall quality is very clear but network is not greatRam management is excellent and experience of one plus oxygen is is close to stock experienceU get great software updates very regularlyBattery to max 4 to 5 hours on screen time if ur very heavy userNo gorilla glass 6 it\\'s 5 u need temper glass mustScreen quality is excellent out of boxStereo speakers are loudNo headphone jack I really miss it and sure everyone will miss\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s not the \"flagship killer\" OnePlus would like it to be, but each iteration gets a little closer. It remains to be seen if subsequent models will become serious competition while remaining at the same price point.As an avid fan of mobile photo/video, this phone is usable but still not quite where I would expect it to be at this price point.All in all, it\\'s an okay phone for the money, but if you\\'re concerned about having quality computational photography, noise-free/artifact-free video, etc, you\\'re better off going with the Pixel 4 (even my pixel 2 XL takes higher quality photo/video with far lower noise and artifacting) or spending a little more for the Galaxy.If having high quality photo or video doesn\\'t rank as high on your list of needs then you will very likely really enjoy this phone and for the price I would definitely recommend it.If high quality photo/video is high on your list of needs, I recommend taking a pass on this phone; It\\'s definitely not for the photo/video enthusiast.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Dear all. One plus is just a chiness product manufacturer by OPPO. Donor waste your money on this device.Go for iphon or samsung S20 or S20 pluse  wastage of money. Fingers print reader is slow and battry life is poor and camra having too much fillter so it auto tune the images.- minus 5 star\\n\\n \\n\\n  Great phone... I was planning on purchasing the OnePlus 7T pro...  But I realized there is negligible difference in both the products... And this phone is alot cheaper than the other one...So I settled for OnePlus 7 ProA great phone.... Has tons of features... And if you\\'re a OnePlus lover then you already know that it\\'s worth every penny....Screen looks amazing... Pop up camera works great... onscreen Fingerprint is faster than previous OnePlus devices... Camera is not the best but it can be ranked in the top 10... Definitely better than majority of Android smart phones.. a good quality product...That\\'s the reason it\\'s called Pro\\n\\n \\n\\n  The main reason why i bought this phone is my old C9 Pro broke and i needed a phone with good Display which can support HDR 10,Then i gone with the hype and finally bought this phone.but i got the problem with the display itself üò™ I wanted a phone with a gud display when i didn\\'t get whta i want for so what do i do with the rest of the specs.After playing any 4K/HDR content ylloew color is appearing on the whole screen even when i put the screen calibration \"Cold\".And when i on the reading mode its worse ....all dispaly is seems like someone spreaded Turmeric Powder on it & its not bright as many samsung\\'s phones.i have been using my old samsung c9 pro for 3yeras and i knw it.Being a movie lover i luv watching movies in my phone. Totally disappointed with the display.OnePlus should update thier dispaly next time with more brighter screen.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is just wonderful! Although the phone was released almost exactly a year ago, it shows no sign of slowing down. The screen is just wonderful, and at its current price point, it\\'s a bargain. Flagship quality for half the price. It misses out on very few features (like wireless charging, but I wouldn\\'t really have used it with Warp Charge, so no complaints from me here) and the camera isn\\'t the best (much better from when it was initially released, the camera captures everything quite naturally, if you give it good lighting though. Low light photography isn\\'t great (especially compared to the iPhone 11 Pro, although that costs over twice what this one costs.) The screen is absolutely mesmerizing! Gets quite bright, but not the brightest. Not overally saturated, color reproduction is quite accurate. In-display fingerprint scanner is as fast as any normal fingerprint scanner, which is great news. OxygenOS is clean and beautiful. An awesome wrapper over android. No bloatware (except a couple of Oneplus Apps which come pre-installed, which are usually deletable). Overall, the best value for money right now (and for the near future as well). Do buy this over the Oneplus 7t or the 8!Enough said about the phone, the delivery process was quite disappointing. Amazon delivery agents don\\'t know how to handle the exchange process. They have no idea how to navigate through the process specified, and wasted almost half an hour of my time, just to give me my phone. I\\'ve faced a similar issue with another phone I got delivered recently, and the experience this time around was even worse. Hope they change it soon.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s an amazing phone. The performance is outstanding. Little big for men pocket but overall package is awesome. Thanks OnePlus team. üòäThanks and regards,Rishi Ratan Singh,Indian Army.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0It is very good product. But only one negative point that the price of the phone is high and we don\\'t get earphones also. I thought they would give a normal earphones. And it doesn\\'t have earphone jack so it should provide some other thing so that we  can connect our normal earphones.battery drains very fast.the overcome this they have provided nice charger but it is of no use if we are out of the house we cannot charge it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have purchased this phone last week.Very fast in performance with no lags at all.Battery backup also good supported with ultra fast charging.Awesome camera and screen quality.Little big in size and heavy in weight, it will take around one week to get settle and use to it. So no worries for size and weight.Overall its a must buy phone if ur budget is around 50K. Apple and Samsung can\\'t compete with one plus quality.\\n\\n \\n\\n  forget about the teaser where oneplus7 is dropped in water. My oneplus7pro exposed to rain for 10 mins and it started flickering and screen damaged.Request all not to take that company video seriously and be careful in monsoon season avoid taking pics with such good camera\\n\\n \\n\\n  Two of the reasons for buying OnePlus 7 Pro were battery life and space. Although Notes app is not pretty much impressive, I need this app to store my ideas and write-ups (I am into professional writing). Moreover, the phone offers 256GB space at a lower cost than any iPhone would provide. For the same storage space in any Apple device, I would have to spend more than 55K. OR I had to choose an older iPhone, which I never wanted to do. So OnePlus 7 Pro was my choice. I can store my data (documents, photos, and videos). Fingerprint, sometimes, needs two-three taps and sometimes, I have to use passcode to unlock the device. But this is OK as long as it is not a daily trouble. If you are into writing or any other creative field, wherein you have to store some data, go for it. And yes, the strong battery. Even if I use mobile data, the battery lasts pretty long...and with its warp charger, it charges quickly. Like the double-tap to wake screen feature...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Over all it is a good phone. Upgrading from oneplus 3t to oneplus 7 Pro. Battery life is the best thing which I felt in this mobile. But there are a few problems with this phone which I encountered in nearly one month of usage.1) Fingerprint scanner not working sometimes :  I do not know whether it is happening to others as well, but when I try to unlock the phone, sometimes the fingerprint scanner is disabled and I have to use the pattern to unlock the screen. It happened a lot in this first one month of the usage.2) Camera is over beautifying the  pics taken. Most of the times when you click a photo, you looks over beautified than the actual person. The depth of the photo is getting compromised in this way. slightly dark colored people like me will get a shook  when you see the first photo of yourself. :D.  Also pics taken from the ultra wide lens are distorted when you zoom a little bit.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought this product because of series name 7 earlier I was using Oneplus 5 since last 2 n half year.After usage of one month .. here is my view.1. Camera is not good as they have done advertisement.2. Warp charging very fast.3. Heating hanging issue while you are using Facebook Live or Facebook Messenger.4. Selfie Camera is poor.5. Not value for money it should be around 42000 maximum  .6. Overall if you are one plus lover just wait for price drop in coming days because sale is not good of One plus 7 pro due to lots of issues and performance.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Screen is great & treat to watch movies & videos. Don\\'t really feel difference of 90hz. Software has glitches & apps crash sometimes. Bought fone after seeing camera ratings on Dox, but to my surprise the quality is very very average & portrait mode struggle a lot with image quality under good artificial lighting. Overall unimpressed with the fone after paying 50k. Hoping software updates will solve the issue. If want oneplus Suggest to buy cheaper 7t else of budget is good go for Samsung s10.\\n\\n \\n\\n  One of the best phone i have ever bought. In fact i have been a fan of Oneplus since 3 years. My first phone from Oneplus was Oneplus 3 which is still performing amazing though it has been 3 years. Good thing about Oneplus 7 pro is it has got everything you need unlike the other phones which is cheap but comes with bloatware, which literally sucks. My rates are below.Camera - 9/10Speed - 10/10Sound - 10/10Resolution - 10/10Fingerprint and Face recognize - 10/10Over all - 10/10Also, the best part is i bought it when there was better offer available from Amazon, which was like 12,000. On top of this i spent about 1,500 for the screen protection which keeps it safe from the damage. Protection Pro which is made from rubber material mostly used by 3M works really well on your phones.Overall i am happy customer of amazon as well as OnePlus.\\n\\n \\n\\n  After using a month Not worth it 50k, user experience is smooth but battery life is really disappointed it only last up to 3 to 4 hour if gaming 2.3 hour very bad warp charge is fake it almost take 1.3 hour even real me 3 pro charge faster it heat up while charging. Camera are not that good redmi note 7pro take same quality of image something even take a better pic than a 50k cellphone what the fcck wrong with oneplus image processing and video recording are not good in low light. Now all my frnd are trolling me is this 52k flagship cellphone .Zen mode is FCKINNNG useless my frnd use this to troll me they put without my permission there üò° should be password. AND MOST INTERESTING FOR A MONTH I COULD NOT USE MY FCCKNG EARPHONES BECAUSE THEY REMOVE HEADPHONE JACK AND THEY DON\\'T PROVIDE CONVERTER DOONGLE INSIDE THE BOX ALOTS OF COST CUTTING ONEPLUS. Buy it it won\\'t disappoint you.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Yes!!! After using this phone for around 2 months now, I have found it to be a pretty solid and a beast of a performer. The phone is snappy and pretty darn quick. The resolution is one of the best and the regular updates we get from OnePlus team is also admirable. Rest camera related opinions are always personal and not indicative of it\\'s performance. Overall a pretty good option for those who want try out something new apart from the likes of The Samsungs, Huaweis..etc. No major or minor complaints.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought it few days ago and I am so impressed with it\\'s performance.I am telling you all the things that I came across.Firstly I bought it at the price of 39999 rs.But I exchanged my old phone for which I got 4950 rs exchange .Thanks to OnePlus\\'s 3000 extra cash back offer.I paid through sbi credit card and I received 2500 cash back instead of 2000.im surprised when I saw it.Firstly im talking about display.Display is so smooth and fluidy. 90 Hz refresh rate works amazing.I mostly life qhd instead fhz.Battery life is very good after update.Warp charger works very well.charges very quicky.Camera performance also great.Little bit improvement needed in front cam.Sliding mechanism also runs smoothly. detect fall very quickly.No lag issue found while playing heavy games.Little bit heating issue.but no worry about it.Curve glass looks premium.no disadvantages found.Oxygen os gives u such amazing experience that other os doesn\\'t .So finally.My honest review.which I felt.{Display}  --  4.8/5{Camera}  --  4.5/5{Battery}.  --  4.5/5{Performance}  --  4.8/5{Looks}.  --  4.6/5{OS}.  --  4.9/5{Pubg}  --  4.8/5{Fin.scn}  --  4.8/5\\n\\n \\n\\n  Op7 Pro Pros:OMG üòç DISPLAY (Esp 90Hz)Good Battery lifeSimple UIFINGERPRINT scannerRegular software tweaksCons: worst cameraNo headphone jackOverall Future smartphone in hand only downside Camera\\n\\n \\n\\n  One of the worst product received ever.....don\\'t know wether is the fault of one plus or seller default ...have received defective peice one month back have received my 7Pro through amazon ...now day by day is showing so many hectics .. network is not at ol fetching the same SIM if I put in other phone is coming normaly with high speed only what is the problem with this set which I bought for 42K this shit not at ol worth even for 10k\\n\\n \\n\\n  Overhyped phone. Only having good in specs doesn\\'t make a phone good. It is also about software running phone. I had samsung galaxy s7 which was awesome phone and after reading reviews bought this phone instead of samsung note 10. Its all regret after that. App will refuse to open up many times. Fingerprint sensor will not work seamlessly if angle change slightly. Overall user experience is not like high end mobile.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It feels super premium. Below are some of the points to consider before you go for this option.1. Look of the phone is just awesome. Feels like just keep staring at the screen.2. Best display i have seen till date( If you watch too many videos this is the one)3. Rear Camera is above average( not up to the mark which was claimed in launch ) Selfie camera is average4. Battery backup is good. You tube reviews say 6-7 hours screen on time. But in reality surprisingly I got more. May be because of my average using.5. Charging speed is super lightning. Delight to watch.6. Gaming experience is awesome.7. Performance. No other phone can match this performance till date.8. Near to stock android experience\\n\\n \\n\\n  Wonderful phone got it for 36.5k with exchange HDFC discount and OnePlus referral for 8gb ram 256gb rom...front camera is average back is good..almond colour is very appealing with glass body it\\'s fragile and dropping it would b a big mistake....screen is very prone to scratches still wondering what is Gorilla glass promoted for should sue the makers for misguiding...screen is excellent using it is a charm..battery drains fast on 90hz but 60hz is not bad atal....since all China phones come from same stable all companies differentiate their products this caters to premium n feel good factor..don\\'t chase specs it\\'s useless sheet...check it yourself and than buy..those reviews online r paid ones so chuck those bloggers aur apni akal algao\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was planning to buy an iphoneX. And then the one plus 7 pro got launched, I was so impressed with configuration and the price that I ordered it the very next day without thinking much..Must say this is one of the best Android phones in market with top notch quality in every feature. No point in wasting money in iPhones..My only problem is the round edges, wish they were straight.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The SCREEN of this phone is magnificent.Probably it can be its best feature. HDR10 QHD+ display üôåThe CAMERA was not as expected at first, but due to OnePlus team\\'s extra efforts the camera has significantly improved (3-4) since launch for the camera.The BATTERY is great for a day\\'s usage but not at the level of the P30 Pro.The BUILD QUALITY is stupendous and is at par with the top players if not better. The phone is heavier than average, which has its own pros and cons.The BUTTONS and the VIBRATION motor give good feedback.The FINGERPRINT READER is fast and you won\\'t notice the difference between the speed of a traditional and an on-screen one.I noticed that the phone was killing apps more than expected. It started killing apps after keeping 3-4 apps in the background (6GB version).Overall, very happy with this investment.\\n\\n \\n\\n  One must must buy oneplus 7 pro to experience something new! Something great! Three good reason to buy it.1. Oneplus has the most active community and third party developers for support2. Best UI thats is the oxygen OS3. Best display QHD+ 6.67\" 90HZ CURVED FLUID AMOLED..Super happy thank you.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got this beast the next day it was on sale.The delivery was super fast though the package was just a plastic bag not much protection. Coming to the phone this phone is absolutely beast. Its better than shown in videos and photos and one can truely enjoy the experience once they get their hands on this phone.Pros :Great display and fluid smooth (90hz and quad hd is the best display ever seen on smartphone)Really fast and total lag freeMade for gamersGreat camera both front and backDesign is bestFree case is very good and warp charging is greatCons :Battery life is not that impressive if you are a heavy user (Gaming or streaming videos)No earphones which you expect after paying this much.Price (should be under 50k)This is an absolute beast phone best smartphone till date\\n\\n \\n\\n  I would like to call op7 pro a dream phone ,have used almost every brand , almost all flagships ,but nothing like a op7 Idk Y it\\'s so much catching me out there may be coz of its beautiful display I assure you guys one thing if u guys use op7 once we won\\'t move back to any other phone due to that display,the best display ever made on a phone ,battery life is so decent I mean for casual users it will catch up a day,for heavy users may be once a top up for the entire day ,camera has improved 10 times more than any other one plus devices,speakers are just awesome I wont say it\\'s the best but for most users it will be fine ,all together in one word I can say that op7 was a dream phone ,a phone everypeople dream about how it should be ,for any other instance or details you can dm me in Instagram ; name : man_of_character_rickyThank you amazon for fast deliveryThank you one plus for such an amazing device\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am a fan of Oneplue. I have used most of the oneplus phones before. but this is greatest of them all.  Great screen / Great Sound. Watch hi-resolution video and audio is a delight. and overall best experience.  I have been using it for more than a week now and impressed over the upgrade I found as compared to my Oneplus 5T.  I am satisfied with this phone so far. A little bit of a higher price for Oneplus phones but Ok if you compared with other Primum brands.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Well It\\'s A Great Phone But Being 8 To 10 Months Old Feels Like A Bit High On Amount Also If I would Have Bought Through OnePlus Site would have Also Got Free Bullets Head Phone Though Have Raised The Complain With Both Amazon And OnePlus That Why U Give Free Bullets Ear Phones In OnePlus Site But Not In Amazon Site But Both Amazon And OnePlus Have Not Replied Yet.ReviewPhone Is ExcellentCamera A ClassPerformance Is Also GreatBuilt Quality Is SuperbNo One Can Beat Oxygen OSOnly Draw Back Battery It would Have Been 4500 or 5000 MAH I would Have Given 10 out of 10 90hrz refresh rate draws to much battery hardly works onefull day.My score 8.5 or 9 Out Of 10\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is an excellent product by one plus.. When I ordered it, I got scared by one star review by many people.. I think it was wrote by competitors.. Happy n proud.. Really\\n\\n \\n\\n  Excellent phone. Superb camera, awesome display, superfast fingerprint scanner, butter smoothly OS, superb warp charging...... everything is excellent.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Pros :1. Display is outstanding.Never seen a display like this in any phone till now .2. Performance is top notch.3. Speakers are mind blowing . Feels like holding a home theatre .Cons.1. Battery is draining too fast due to display QHD + and 90 hz refresh rate .2. Camera is not that of a hype .Overall best phone to buy keeping the price and specs in mind . Very satisfied üòÑ\\n\\n \\n\\n  Guys after using 3 days ..I can say it\\'s the best device for 50 k..90hz screen is too good...and speed mind blowing..Camera quality is not that much good as per the specs but with update it will improve . Fingerprint reader is too fast.Battery life is awesome ..pie runs your usage pattern and then give you the best battery life...I am getting 6 hours of screen on time with 2 hours of PUBG which is much more than my 5TAudio quality - awesome , pair it with apple airpods or  jbl Bluetooth earphones .Device is not that big, you will get used to with time and other displays will look small to you.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Well well, in simple word description: KillerEverything in this phone is top class.Camera quality is brilliant and performance is next level.Motorized camera is very responsive.As of know i didn\\'t find any glitch in this phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Really excellent product a premium smart phone from 1+ üòçüòç really it\\'s flagship killer ü•∞ü•∞-Curved screen-4 thousand mAh battry(in very normal use u get 4-5 days of battery life)really its awesome-In display fingerprint sensor which is relly fast-Sterio speaker üòçüòçwith dolby atoms....-Sd 855 powerfull md beast processor ü•∞ü•∞-Last i say really go beyond the speed.......üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò\\n\\n \\n\\n  This mobile is awesome in looks wise as well as performance wise.if you are looking for a premium range mobile than this is a best choice.worth buying.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Phone is really good. Beautiful display and fast. One plus nailed it with this phone. Camera though is wanting a bit. Starts blurring when you zoom.The other big area of let down is the finger print recognition... It is very average. Many a times it doesn\\'t even recognize the fingerprint. The face recognition is good but there is a little lapse as the camera had to pop out. This biometric aspect is no where close to the one plus 6.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Writting this after using 1.5 months.Pros are1. built quality2. premium look3. warp charging4. camera is much better after many updates5. Stunning Display (qhd+ resolution & 90hz refresh)6. Performance (Speed, speed, speed.....)7. Very good Speakers8. Faster fingerprint sensor9. No heating issue10. Smooth UICons1. Feels bulky in hand(hard to use in one hand)2. Weight3. Not bad battery life4. Double tap wakeup misbehaves (while holding in hand wakes the display even when not double tappped)5. Proximity sensor (since placed on top, it malfunctions during call)6. No notification led\\n\\n \\n\\n  I love the device..but it doesn\\'t come with any accessory.. nothing at all..that was pretty disappointing cause, in other countries it came with a lot of accessory.. really interesting ones..why the different approach to us...the camera is just insane...the details it captures with night mode is also interesting...finger print reader is insanely fast..camera quality is at par with all similar devices of other brands...I bought it for the camera and it delivers\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought this phone on first day of launch. My views :Pros :- Display quality is amazing & enjoying it- Speed is extremely good- Camera is very good- Some of the features are good in this modelCons :- Battery life is not good. Need lot\\'s of improvements in battery optimization- In adaptive brightness the screen brightness doesn\\'t change automatically (even if you set it) many a time. You have to manually switch the adaptive brightness off & then on, then the screen will change the brightness. This might be a bug, which OnePlus needs to resolve- In the new pc received I found bubbles on screen guard provided- Weight of the product is highUsing it for more than 15 days now & I am loving it inspite of few negative points, being a OnePlus lover. But the company has to improve the product in many ways & we expect the updated in the near future.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very smooth and buttery.....I am a big fan of OnePlus phones and the performance of this phone completely blown me off.....Good Job OnePlus team.....keep it up....üëç\\n\\n \\n\\n  Simple good at these price segment i will be waiting so long to get it but whrn i get these phone in lockdown after 2 months the waiting worth these productsAbout phoneIt\\'s all about display.... those who wnat best display must go for it... you definitely observed get different in between rog 2 and OP 7 pro ya  you sacrifices more battery and air trigger bt you got more in these phone water resistant and and camera get huge difference in both\\n\\n \\n\\n  Writing review after a weekPros :- Worth buying it.- Premium look and design- Lightweight and fast Oxygen OS- Display quality is awesome specially one can feel difference of 90Hz refresh rate vs 60Hz- Best experience for playing games and videos on QHD+ fluid AMOLED- Sound quality is best with Dolby Atmos- Battery life is really good. With full battery it works for more than a day with moderate use of phone with gaming & watching videos- Camera quality is not up to a mark compared to other flagship phones but better than its previous version 6TCons :- No 3.5 mm headphone jack- No IP rating for water resistance- Slightly bigger in size- Slightly heavy in weight- Ghost touch on cornors. Hope this would be resolved in upcoming software updates.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Pro:- Display- Performance- Great in display fingerprint reader- Awesome fnatic mode for gamers- Zen mode for the ones who uses phone too much- Great low light photography- Great camera quality (after recent update)- Really nice portrait mode- Super fast wrap charging- The pop-up camera, one must admit it\\'s pretty cool- heptic feedback makes gaming experience better for supported app.- great stereo soundCons:- Battery life is not great but the super fast wrap charging compensate that.- Some times photos are not great, might need some tweaking to get that great shot.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome and excellent phone....Delivery is quick in 2 days..The only con is it is a bit heavy.. But the fantastic screen makes u forget about that...And u need to use a case. As it is heavy if it falls accidentally there are more chances of getting damaged..Regarding charging 30w charger is superb..Battery draining is not so fast.. An average user can get a ful day charge easily...I don\\'t use camera much... I used Asus zenfone 5z and LG v30 plus previously both are flagship phones at that time. But the camera quality is very nice here compared to both of them..Fingerprint reader is also fast and smooth.. I don\\'t use face unlock bcoz it takes a little time and need to swipe to get the pop up camera open..Got a transparent case in the box.. It is of good quality but it doesn\\'t give a good look to ur mobile. So better to buy a back cover online..Display is very smooth.. Watching movies and videos Is awesome... It\\'s very bright and got no problems in watching under direct sunlight..Not too many customizations we can find here in oxygen os..Coming to stereo speakers, they are good and decent but not as loud as zenfone 5z..As there is no headphone jack I had ordered Bluetooth earphones.. They are on the way and had to use them to write review about sound quality..Played PUBG and other big games without any lag.. Runs very smooth.. As it is 12GB ram all the games and apps we use they Wil be in the ram without getting closed..The phone may gets heated up definitely if we use camera for more time or play non stop games.. That Wil be very common with any mobile..You need to be very careful as it is very heavy it is slippery too.. So u need to definitely use a case for that..My final verdict is if you don\\'t have problem with it\\'s weight then it is the best flagship phone right now in the market at this price.. Lack of wireless charging and headphone jack is not a problem to me.. It has the best screen till now..Am writing now after 20 days of use now.. I observed it\\'s hanging sometimes when playing some small games which I did not get any prblm with big games. I don\\'t know why.. Despite of having 12gb ram why it\\'s hanging.. I hope it Wil be resolved in future updates..And one more thing is proximity sensor is not working properly a lot of times during calls leading to accidental touches which is irritating.. Hope everything Wil be solved in future updates..Thank you...\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0Please see the attached video. This was my first oneplus purchase. I purchased it on 20th Oct in sale and prepaid 42000. Got it on 24th and as you see it had faulty Android and hanging issue. I was unable to do even initial setup. NOW AMAZON REMOVED THEIR RETURN POLICY. so you can not directly return it, one TAPORI technician will come and he will check whether mobile is really having any issue or not. Trust me he was one of the most unprofessional person I met in my life. But some how he understood my problem and forwarded the issue to Amazon team. So now my replacement will come in next week.CONCLUSION: I paid 42000 on 20th Oct and I got working mobile on 4th of Nov. This is worst service by Amazon and worst product of Oneplus. Never gone buy any oneplus product again.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Thank you Amazon for the fast delivery, before ordering oneplus7 pro I had read comments, mostly negative comments but still ordered it, I got phone next day and when opened it start the screen I fall in love withs phone, great affort put by OnePlus company for making such beautiful mobile phone, it\\'s fast, charging is super fast, graphics is excellent, all set phone, guys you all must buy this phone and get fabulous experience.\\n\\n \\n\\n  awesome product,really beyond the speed...clone my old one plus phone with nebula blue.. with in 15 min..all data transfer.. by one plus switch..stylish star... macho look.... brilliant..for one plus.. in bocca al lupo for future endeavours...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Everything is perfect except for the fact that the shipped phone was having a scratch. Came to know when I removed the pre - applied screen guard to apply the new one. Pathetic.Amazon should definitely look into it. I need a replacement. This is absolutely absurd. We spend 50+ and get this shit.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Delivery was very satisfying. I received the product in just one day.Oneplus 7pro nebula blue 12 gb with 256 gb.Pro.As everyone stats its buttery n super speed.Charges very fast.ConsCamera needs a major update.On the first time of use from the box n while charging the mobile was pretty much heated.At least a converter for Head phones should be provided.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Don\\'t buy. Very bad experience with oneplus 2nd time.One plus 7 pro has heating problem. It gets heated without even using it. Gets heated when on charge. Gets heated while paying game. Feels like it will brust.I bought one plus 2 3 years back it has the heating problem so i sold that. Now when i bought one plus 7 pro again it has the same problem. Infact i have replaced my previous one plus seven pro and the one which i got and using now has the same problem of heating. You can\\'t use it continuously as it gets heated so much. Charging is fast. Battery life is ok. Processing is fast. Camera is good. But what\\'s the point of spending 49k if yiu cant use is properly. Thanks.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Battery back up is not up to the mark, i am using this phone since 4 months, in early days phone\\'s battery back up was too good, now its battery drains too fast. If u are a heavy gamer, i will suggest u to not to buy this phone, u will really disappoint. Today if i charge 100 percent, i can play only 2 to 2.30 hours maximum(PUBG). Although Charging speed is good, in 1 hour u can charge more than 90 percent. Except battery i do not have any bigger problem ever since face in this phone, one whtspp issue was there, the phone hangs when u send or upload the photo, but later on they fix that problem. Built quality is good, 1 or 2 times the phone was fallen from my hand from  2 to 3 foots, but it\\'s screen doesn\\'t damage.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Display is so fragile tat it broke with small touch they say it\\'s gorilla glass and even then it\\'s fragile ... I gonna complaint in consumer court regarding this the coustomer care people say it\\'s gorilla glass warranty not covered for it u HV to bare complete amount for it ... If it is so then why they HV mentioned it gorilla glass or I might have got defective piece then\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very dissapointing from oneplus8gb ram is in the phone but still there is a problem of bug and freezes mainly while u taking a lots of call and the 2nd largest issue is network .while call its ok but while using internet the connection get lost after using of one or half hour then you have to restart the phone or doing flight mode on/off for restart of internet3rd thing is its software improvement there is more features  in mi phone under 15k phone than one plus 7 pro specially its fingerprint lock remove option from individual appsI have bought two phone of varient 8gb ram or 256 gb memory but the phone is not the value of money its totally waste of money\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s blazing fast... Solid build.. better than rivals..90hrts...consumes lots of battery....Bit pricey considering the brand.. But its not  a big deal.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Its a good phone to use. If you were a premium phone user from before you will not find any difference. Only differnce you might find is the display and camera because of pixels and refresh rate.You cannot use the phone if you are wearing a good quality gloves\\n\\n \\n\\n  One plus 7 Pro is truly a beautiful phone just fell in love with the phone when I got my hands on it, I\\'m using the phone since 2 days, I want to say a lot of positive things about the phone but I\\'ll make it short, this phone exceeds my expectations in all aspects, just go for it, a great buy, I\\'ll highly recommend it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Simply a worthy premium smartphone for daily use. Have been using it for almost 4+ months. 90Hz display is amazing and smooth (one of my favourite these days). On screen fingerprint is fast enough for unlocking the phone. Unfortunately, i didn\\'t used face unlock and i didn\\'t use front camera often. So no comments on that.With 30W Warp Charge, the 4000mAh battery can be recharged pretty fast as well (as per the company\\'s claim and its working excellent so far).Camera is working as expected and also tried few nightmode shots and it is also satisfying.No troublesome heating issues found so far.There is no headphone jack, but i don\\'t have any problem with that as I am using OnePlus Bullet Wireless 2 (Excellent choice for OnePlus7Pro).Ps:- This is my first OnePlus company\\'s product and I simply loved everything about it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I got this for 46k after offer also got 1 year screen replacement guaranty free, so accordingly, this phone is value for money.Pros -1 Looks are great2 Camera provide enough details as needed3 Fingerprint sensor is damn fast as  compared to samsung ultrasonic fp reader.4 popup camera motor is fast and i sometime miss to see popup while it unlocks phone with face unlock.5 battery at Qhd resolution 90 htz display provide 4.5 hours screen on time (a day usage including standby), Qhd 60 htz provide 5.5 hours and Full Hd 60 htz provide 6 hours Screen on Time. On an average i get a full day usage easily.6 weight distrubution is excellent that phones doesn\\'t feel heavy in hand.Cons:low light camera performance is ok ok.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been using 8GB variant for 3 months.Before this one  , i had OP 5t. 5t never had heating issues whereas this phone gets heated with continuous use.The only pros of upgrading to 7pro from 5t is quality of display , bezel less display , screen size. But 7 pro is not up to the mark in terms of camera performance. Below average camera. It sometimes clicks good picture under good light conditionsMost of the times i use FHD+ display to save battery and i hardly switch to QHD+ which doesn\\'t really make much difference.Finger print reader is fine. Not as fast as 5t that may be because of in display finger print reader.Overall this mobile is okay if you are not a camera enthusiastic.But personally i don\\'t find it to be a worthy upgrade from op5t.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Interested in returning and getting a refundA lot of issues with One plus 7 Pro...1) Ghost touches- the touch screen acts wierd sometimes and apps open up and closes automatically.2) Delayed Response- while making calls, there is quite a long delay one I click call option. Sometime feels like the touch is not working and suddenly after 10-15 sec or more, the phone goes into calling mode.3) Voice disturbances-many instances, when the call is made, voice is not transmitted.4) CAMERA- even after the update the back camera is still blurred. Indoors it take decent photography but not up to the mark of a flagship killer (as these are called). The focus is bad. In potrait (depth) mode background is not blurred.I have been following OnePlus community forums and these problems are common all across. Also different people are getting different issues.Would really like to get money back. But the option for refund or replacement wasn\\'t available initially and now it shows refund period closed on 30th may. Looks like a cheap stunt to force the products on the consumers.\\n\\n \\n\\n  1. Sometimes touch donot work properly. I need to reopen the app to do so.2. I cannot put conference call.. if I try to do call with the person will get disconnected.3. Camera will pop up automatically during the phone call4. Google assistance starts automatically without any instructionsStill there are lots of issues in this mobile and I m seriously fed up of this..\\n\\n \\n\\n  Phone is excellent. Front screen is not scratch proof at all. So put a screen guard. After one and half months I can\\'t make or recieve calls. Will have to take it to service center\\n\\n \\n\\n  After using it (THE ONEPLUS 7 PRO ) FOR 6 MonthsFor gaming 10/10For camera 9/10 coz dslr still gets 10/10; )For premium quality 100/10 solid2k display is aweeeesome colour saturation is the bestDefinately better than iphone 11 pro maxOverall Pros with no cons is DAMM TRUEGUYS I found this phone very very much filled with Greatness.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Switched from iPhone 7 and love it. The phone is super fast and the display is amazing. Love the reading mode. The battery life isn\\'t too great however the charging speed compensates. Overall awesome phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was a little skeptical about switching to android from Apple but when I bought this phone I was convinced that I\\'ve made the right decision.Camera, battery, display and sound are top notch. I know people that are using OnePlus 3/5/6 for years without any complaints. So I\\'m sure about its durability.I think this is the best option in android now and will remain that way for sometime. So go for it!\\n\\n \\n\\n  I\\'ve had this phone for 4 months now. I\\'ll just get down to what I feel about it so far.Personally, this phone was way out of my budget, so I used the HDFC debit card (zero payment) EMI. I still have 2 months left on it, but I don\\'t regret this decision one bit.The phone is built really well and the pop-up camera has an incredible \\'reflexes\\'. Meaning if you accidentally drop your phone while the pop cup camera is open, the phone detects this and immediately shuts it before the phone drops to the ground.The camera is superb- both video and still. The landscape wide-angle lens is almost at par with the iPhone 11 (I did a comparison with my friend\\'s). The slo-mo video camera is pretty good too. The phone also has an inbuilt video stabilizer. The quality of the video deteriorates in this mode, but in a well-lit environment it\\'s still great!The phone charges really quickly, from nothing to full in about 2 hours.Two downsides to this phone are that the finger print recognition can be a little annoying. It doesn\\'t always recognise the fingerprint instantly. And the other is the mic for capturing audio. I\\'m a musician and sound designer and I thought that this phone would give me almost iPhone like audio recording, but it\\'s way off. It\\'s a long time before this phone can reach to where the iPhone is in terms of audio recording.All in all, a great phone. Super fast, can play any game, run any app and stream any video smoothly.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Mobile is good. After 4months usage I am giving this review. I received good product without any problem and damage. Mobile function is good till now. But only problem is with screen guard. There is offline screen guard available for this screen. And no mobile service shops are putting screen guard.If possible include screen guard along with mobile.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Before purchasing OnePlus 7pro..asked my friend about OnePlus they has given good review for one plus...now i bought OnePlus 7pro camera quality is good but my mobile is hanging a lot while checking photos on gallery suddenly it will come out from the gallery and phone wallpaper get changed like default wallpaper will appear..while using insta or watsup not able to share pics it\\'s taking too much time to loading..one plus disappointed me a lot..i am thinking why i bought this mobile i spent 50k on this phone instead i hv to purchase iphone.. if is there any chance to return i will definitely return this phone...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Been almost 4 months upgrading to the pro version of OnePlus , camera could have been better ,missed out on the most important feature the phone not being IP rated. Even than lots of reviewer have tested in water so did I & product seems to work fine without any issues .Despite of having such a beautiful display & 90hrz power pack performance there isn\\'t any tempered glass for same which I can protect it with .Upgrades & updates have been consistently improving without any delay or lags.Pop up camera seems to work perfectly great knowing the fact about limited numbers of move ,insipite of same there have been lot of safety measures for force movement incase occured at time in pocket . I wouldn\\'t suggest to use face unlock more often as the under display scanner is the best in it\\'s class & most freakingly smooth.Glass back is litle bit scary at times as now we have to protect the front as well back of the phone ,for which I use the default case provided by OnePlus themself .Shipping this phone has been a night Mayer for me as amazon weren\\'t efficient enough to deliver the product to me on time ,as sum issue with there shipper & loss of good .which was a surprise to go through .Overall it\\'s a good experience on the handset side ,since there\\'s nothing better than having a 90hz refresh rate & such a powerful performance.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Shifted to this phone from Samsung Galaxy note 8. Display is as good as Samsung and camera is much better. Fingerprint sensor is not up to the mark, it struggles most of the time. Battery is just average, but charging speed is amazing. Phone is little bulky and heavy. Note 8 was far sleeker. But comparing to note 10 plus, which I was considering, this phone is value for money due to 26k price difference.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Too good this phone is amazing, 90 Hz refresh rate combined with fluid display and super performance by SD855, camera bundle is well integrated in its OS, Telephoto is icing on cake along with its mineral glass in aluminum casing giving it a feel of premium phone this device in whole is a complete package\\n\\n \\n\\n  Display is so delicate my frnds display broken cost 17000, frnds if you purchase, take one assist insurance or use templered glass and screen guard on it, and a good quality backcover, since it is a curved display more chances of braking if front glass also breaks then also full scrren to be replaced\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s been 3 days that I got my hands on this beast. So far fully satisfied with Screen, Finger Sensor, Wrap charging, Processing etc. Camera could have been a little better for this price range.  While zooming there are litter blurred pics and front camera definitely could use some improvement. But over all worth it\\'s price. Go for it !!!!!!!!!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Screen - 10/10Battery - 10/10Warp Charging - 10 / 10 ( 30 mins - 54% charge From 0 To 54% )Camera - 9/10 (Google Pixel Wins this by 1%)Speakers - They Are Actually Loud ! ( 10/ 10)Software - Oxygen OS - 12/ 10Gaming - Beautiful 20/20Microphone For Calling Gaming On The Device - 10/10Earpiece Speaker - 10/10 ( 100% Better Than Asus 6z As I Own That Phone Also, Now Upgraded To This )Packaging Of The Product -By OnePlus - 10/ 10By Amazon Cardboard Box - Great 8/10In The Box - Phone , Type C OnePlus Cable , Warp Charger Adapter , Ejector Tool Pin , User Manual .*What I Didn\\'t Like *Paid 43k for the phone but no type c to earphones adapter in the box , had to buy it seperately from their official site . ( I have the OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6T too where I received the earphones adapter for the One Plus 6T in the box itself )\\n\\n \\n\\n  Better than s10 and iPhone xs at this price.Screen on this device is LIT.And yes normal users will experience the difference between 90Hz and 60Hz.About battery i get an avg SOT of 7.30hrs.Warp charging is best in the market,almost charges upto 50percent within 20mins.Only one thing which is a little bit downside is the camera.Which i am sure will be upgraded with future software updates.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It is easy to grade on the performance but it is very deficult to explain.Simply Beyond IMAGINATION S.  in all aspects on the concepts of a mobile phone. Congratulations ONEPLUS.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Excellent phone.. Superb Camera.. Extraordinary screen.. super smooth touch feel.. only one thing about charging is the wrap charger is nothing different than the Dash charger it takes the same time as dash one.. Overall a great phone for a Good price..\\n\\n \\n\\n  Happy with the phone one plus delivered its promise and the few bug fix n patch update  makes it still smooth no lags even in heavy games and screen response is beyond compare the display clarity is beyond compare I stream Netflix  content n prime love yo watch.. the battery last till 50% in normal mode  when saver mode its super  cool when u adjust the refresh rate and optimised use...Gaming mode is added  cool stuff ...\\n\\n \\n\\n  A very crisp and sharp fluid AMOLED FHD+ screen with 90HZ refresh rate. The best u can get in the Market.The camera is good , pictures are sharp but does lack some features like wide angle option for selfie.The battery drains fast if you use it in the highest resolution but with battery saver you can really use the phone well. It does give you options to change the resolution to save the battery if you are not into battery saver.The phone is a little heavy and big if you are used to lighter phones but you\\'ll get used to it.Well it\\'s OnePlus , it\\'s absolutely worth the money.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s almost an year since I have purchased this phone. It\\'s still the best mobile out there in this price segment. Phone is buttery smooth except for the buggy updates. It can handle all from 2120p video to a high end graphic game with real processing speed. For those who are into cameras, I would suggest to look for other options as OnePlus still has to do lot of improvement on camera.Apart from that it rules in every other section like Gaming, Bluetooth connectivity, antennas reception etc.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Using this phone for more than 7 moths now but this one still feels the same in terms of smoothness as day one. Quality of each part in intact till date. And I just can\\'t get enough of its Display. It\\'s a treat to eyes.I must say that this is the best phone that I have ever used and one of the most satisfying purchases I have ever made.In future, may be after 4-5 years, when I will reflect back I will be proud of myself that I had held and used this phone in past. :)Keep making amazing products Oneplus. You guys are game changers.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome mobile I\\'m writing this review after a week of using it... Phone was really cool n smooth no words can explain how good it is... Phone was fully loaded with advance features.. camera quality is too good no need to carry ur DSLR camera... Fingerprint is too good n too fast...Battery backup is great... Over all the build quality is awesome and phone looks stunning... Love u one+\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought this mobile by listening someone words like one plus is wonderful and I faced few draw backs in this mobile which are primarily battery draw back( kept charge twice a day with playing games and videos as well), mobile got too much heat and also taking long time to change battery, mobile is too weight as well and also not sharing minimum internet speed other devices such as laptops and other mobiles as well and very poor security settings found in this mobile. These are the problems that I have faced with in 15 days around. Please check before purchase this product. Waste of money to purchase this product I guess‚òùÔ∏è\\n\\n \\n\\n  PHONE APPEARANCE LOOKS GOOD, BUT SO MANY DISADVANTAGES LIES WITH PHONE. FOREMOST THING IS THAT ITS HANGING, WHEN IT COMES TO DATA USAGE WIFI IS RUNNING GOOD BUT MOBILE DATA IS NOT WORKING SO FAST, AND ITS HEAVY WEIGHT AND THIS PRICE IS ALSO SO HIGH THOUGH ITS NOT HAVING GREAT FEATURES. WITH SO MUCH EXPECTATIONS I PURCHASED BUT I AM TOTALLY DISSATISFIED. REQUESTING PLEASE DON\\'T PROMOTE THESE KIND OF PRODUCTS.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It is an excellent phone to use and didn\\'t find any issues in the last 2 weeks. I like curved screens after using Samsung S9+ and this one didn\\'t disappoint me. The audio isn\\'t as much loud like S9+ but it\\'s fine.  OnePlus has to work on image quality, probably thru software update. Always on display isn\\'t that pleasing, even OPPO has made hugh step in coming up with always on display themes; time for OnePlus to step up.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have used OnePlus 2 in the past, I like the near stock android  experience with the oxygen OS. The speed of carrying any task is the main attraction of this device.Though the camera is average , it actually takes good shots at times.If you are looking for that curved screens like samsung, this is a wonderful phone, but with more of accidental touches on the edges while viewing content.Charging speed is very helpful at all times.\\n\\n \\n\\n  One plus is moving towards premium segment pricing. But gone all those days were Oneplus was flagship killer. I thing instead of investing on Oneplus 7 Pro, we can go to Samsung S10 which has more premium look & feel plus you get all top premium feature like Samsung Pay, Wireless charging, head phone Jack, IP rating, better camera & etc, because here ur not only getting best hardware but best propitiatory software/services to which all come very handy. OnePlus 7 Pro is very heavy to hold in hand, ergonomics/aesthetics is not good.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Like about OnePlus 7 Pro1. Gaming Mode2. Fnatic mode3. Zen mode4. Screen Recording5. Oxygen OS6. Warp ChargeDislike about OnePlus 7 Pro1. Rear Camera 12 MP instead of 48 MP.2. Front Camera 4.1 MP instead of 16 MP.3. Poor Battery Performance.4. Screen is not scratch resistant.  Overall -1. Graphics- Great2. Ram Management- Great3. Battery Optimisation- Not Good4. Camera- Not Good5. Physical Overview- Good.  Total 3 out of 5.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Amazing phone with amazing features...oneplus rocks...it\\'s my third oneplus device and still I feel that I have the fastest device in my hand...go for it it\\'s a great phone...thank you oneplus.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Hello friends today I am giving my after using of this mobile 20 daysi have used mobile earlier around 30000 budgets with 42mp selphy ,24 mp selphy and bla bla blaaabut no once compare to thisBuild quality five star camera quality 5 starDisplay quality awesomeFull view best experience in displayI have attached some night mode images  those are unbelievable for camera qualityonly bettery life is low 2 hours in compare to others which will happend due to high display quality and other apps but we can ignore it due to fast charging at speed of 20minits in 38% charging ..its so fast...never dispointed usnotice thisüëáüëáüëáWhen you got your new phone and if you start your your camera without any sign in Google,  your camera will not show clear picture so you will be e disappointed and shocked that my mobile camera is damaged but this is for security reasons. When you insert your sim card and sign into your Google account then you can open your gallery and can see all clear pictures taken by your camera. Don\\'t be panic\\n\\n \\n\\n  My first OnePlus phone and it\\'s awesome. There is little weight that you might feel. Charging is super fast, you will never conplain about it. Camera quality is not that great as per its price but beauty is they are continuously pushing updates to make it even better. It\\'s smooth. I don\\'t play games at all so gamer u have no idea wabiut would you look in a phone. Battery backup is awesome. Just one concern, OnePlus needs to push security updates on time. Like it was already end of June when we got May 1st security patch. Gcam works perfect without doing any alteration in the system. Nughtscape is kind of ok till this update when I\\'m writing it. What else left? Yeah just one more thing, it feels little costly, but would give you great feeling of not owning that cheap version of crap which would merely last an year. So go for it and handle with Care üòâ\\n\\n \\n\\n  No headphones or even converter don\\'t know what one plus will save but sure disappointing customers with these small mistakes....even we can\\'t find a original one in one plus site they are always out of stock\\n\\n \\n\\n  Best Smartphone ever at this Price Segment. Its worth every panny..go for it, if you can afford. Have been using it for past 2 days, didnt find any shortcoming in any aspect be it battery, screen, design THIS PHONE TICKS ALL THE BOXES ! NEVER SETTLE with any lesser competent phone than this !\\n\\n \\n\\n  The first time I saw the phone in my hand, I was astonished! My god such a beautiful display üòÄ The speed of app loading & data transfer is truly incredible. One plus nailed it & delivers total customer satisfaction. I would like to thank Amazon for it\\'s safe & speedy delivery. Don\\'t think .. just buy the one plus pro!\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been using OnePlus 7 pro for the last 2 months and here is the long time review :-Pros :Fastest phone in the market. Trust me after using this phone, you will not feel like using anything elseFingerprint scanner is the fastest in the market & it is amazingPhone charging is blazing fastCamera is too good & the nightscape is amazing. At par compared to Samsung and much better than Redmi phonesOxygen OS is like stock android with Zero ads and no preinstalled garbage appsYou can watch HDR and 4K contents in this phone and the screen quality is out of the world. Watching HDR in Netflix is a bliss in this phoneVideo recording in 4k 60fps is amazingConsCamera can be little better particularly video can\\'t be recorded in wide angle lensBattery life is average considering the consumption if you turn on QHD display with 90hz refresh rate... It will eat a large chunk of batteryI am in love with this phone and upgrading to this phone is a great choice\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got it delivered today.I must say, the display quality has improved like anything. Triple Camera beyond words and sounds are like the real Dolby. Warp is faster than 6T charger. All the other specs are the usuals.Cons :Heavy built - weights more than 6TNo jack given - headset\\n\\n \\n\\n  Overall phone is good but at this range the camera quality should have been better, battery life is also decent and it would go upto full 1 day use with above average usage as it\\'s a wrap charging technology so battery won\\'t be an issue for that, I realised finger print really is not upto the Mark as it\\'s fast reader but sometimes it lag in reading finger. Display of this phone is absolutely amazing but sound quality the output would have been better,its ok though. Overall i am using this phone from past 4 months now and its still fast and i didnt face any lag at the time of playing game or using apps.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Was using Samsung s9 plus after coming from OP 5T coz of the 2k display and dual speakers.. N now.. OP deliversss!!! 2k display +90hz refresh rate...!! Buttery smooth.. That transitions when in 90hz..makes thisa awestruck display.. Also coupled with Dolby atmos powered dual speakers. Couldn\\'t have asked for more.. Every reason to comeback to OP family..I could say no need of wireless charging any day since we r getting warp charge with whooping 30W..its lightning speed..\\n\\n \\n\\n  Using this phone from last 2 days...Straight out of the box...one of the best looking smartphone.Crisp display... Good camera... Good battery backupAnd the speed is like crazyAll you are gonna miss is notification light... 3.5 mm jack and wireless charging at this price point.But otherwise....this is a serious flagship killer.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Product is good but yesterday my phone is to heat my hand also like burn I switched off my phone I call one plus centre she tell me reboot your phone I say okk when I reached my home I go to charging my mobile I see my phone charging point is burn I call to one plus but they are not respond on this situation i want exchange my product why I trust this type phone not issue in again phone also in warranty but company reply is so slow not purchased online go to shop and purchase it don\\'t trust online product . Exchange my this type product I purchased on 16 Jan only 5 month I used for pay 43000 thousand\\n\\n \\n\\n  The pictures are so bad with the stupid beautification and there is no way to disable it. Blurs out all the features and smoothens the pictures.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was super excited for this phone. It\\'s the second day today and it just died and wouldn\\'t start. I had about 80% battery left. I had to literally Google to check if there are other folks facing the similar issues and to my surprise there were plenty. I have used 5T and 6T both and I never faced this issue but it\\'s completely annoying and disappointing that a phone would die like this on just the second day. Additionally I didn\\'t quite like the battery life, even when I am not using it, the phone seems to be losing a lot of charge. The other issue I faced was I tried the smart Lock feature and used my finger print lock and also the pattern lock. The fone would automatically lock itself even when I am watching you tube or using the fone. This was like annoying to the heights. I had selected the screen time for 5 mints but still the fone would auto lock within seconds. I was so annoyed so I removed all the lock system off\\n\\n \\n\\n  Using this device since July. Build quality is awesome. Dolby Sound and 90hz display are the two main stand out features and they are incredible. Camera is not the best but post update its performing quite good in my opinion.In my case Battery-powered backup is almost 20-22hrs with resolution set to 2K and refresh rate set to 90hz(with screen on time of almost 6:30hrs).Overall the phone and UI is insanely fast and responsive. No lags what so ever.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Its superb in all fields the only thing you will listen about the phone is camera is not that good but its not true it is doing great job yeah in some condition there was issue but almot fixed with ota update night mode is excellent i think remaining small issues will be fixed by ota like sometimes images are not that sharp but overall this device is excellent\\n\\n \\n\\n  Display is the best in the marketright now, fingerprint reader is as fast as you can imagine, games like pubg are extremely smooth and graphics are absolutely amzing. Oxygen os is just so amazing and easy to use and it\\'s extremely fluid. Battery life depends on how much you use the phone really , if you use camera a lot or play lot of pubg then it won\\'t last for a day otherwise you\\'re good to go for one day. My only complain is the camera. In this price of phone you expect really good camera. Unfortunately that\\'s not the case. Camera is just average. Selfie pop up camera looks really cool and catches some attention and its better than the main camera. Nightscape is just a gimmick. So other than the camera , everything else is just perfect.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome cell phone must buy, best in Android, best in a market right now, best from all cell phones, value for money.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s a beauty & the beast... What a phone they\\'ve made !Everything is so awesome, and this blue color I\\'m falling in love with it everyday !!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Been using it since launch, battery life is absolutely fantastic and so is the display. However, the camera or its software leaves much to be desired.If I cared about the absolute best image quality, I would not pick this phone. But I don\\'t, and I agree with the majority in stating that no other phone has gone through a whole day with me (except perhaps the P30 Pro) and I would definitely recommend this phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  There is a issue with pixels of display , when ever you play any video which has low light kind of dark videos then a greenish flash is blinking up on the screen.i visited the customer and they do know that issue is there in specific to one plus 7 pro series but no help provided. Worst service by op service\\n\\n \\n\\n  The display is the key point which outrage this phone. I just brought this phone for it\\'s display. It feels too smooth & the 90Hz display is way better than u think. Since it\\'s a curved display & huge display with no notches on it you have to be a bit careful in handling it. If you are a bit rough handler then you need to think twice before buying, but if you are a soft user as me then if budget is not a constraint then this is the right phone at this price point.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Pros:1. Big 6.67 inch AMOLED Infinity display with curved edges2. 90hz screen refresh rate3. Popup selfie camera (so there are no blind spots in the screen)4. Big battery (4000mAh) and fast charging5. Fluid and snappy Oxygen OSCons:1. No official water resistance rating2. No wireless charging3. No headphone jack (have to buy headphone and adapter separately)4. No expandable storage5. Slightly bulky design\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is absolutely the cheapest flagship phone you could get at this price point.It\\'s positives are1. Nearly Bezelless display2. Fluid Amoled display with curved edges.3.Super Fast charging speeds (30W)4.90HZ refresh rate5. Excellent camera setup6.Great viewing angles7.UFS 3.0 supportIts negatives are1. Not a great power house due to the 90hz display and the quad hd resolutions2. Images are soft (but can be improved with some software updates)\\n\\n \\n\\n  This product is really nice. Really strong camera on the back and awesome features embaded in a phone. Purchased this at the time of launch and since then it has been an awesome gaming and video experience. Only thing is that they could have worked a little better on the night mode and on the quality of front camera. Apart from this no complaint, a truely awesome product.\\n\\n \\n\\n  My god this phone is a wet dream for many tech savvy people out in the world. you can get better camera in iphones...better utility options in samsung....better hardware in ROG phones by asus....BUT YOU CAN GET THEM ALL IN THIS BEAST. This is all you need for a phone that can obliterate any and every flagship phones in the market. This phone completes your desire for an ultimate phone . Trust me...THIS IS BEST YOUR MONEY CAN BUY YOU IN ANDROID RIGHT NOW.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0ONE PLUS 7 PRO 12GB/256 GB  UNBOXING. FOR 1+ FANS ITS A MUST BUY. I RATED IT 9.8/10 OVERALL.

Photos are good.The person who use more incoming and outgoing calls... This phone is not advisable..Finally I am not Happy with this Mobile.\\n\\n \\n\\n  What an awesome Mobile to have.. Superfast.. amazing look... Best design.. super cool features..Its 90 hz display is love.. i was confused between one plus 8 and one plus 7pro.. but I am very happy that i made the right decision to buy one plus 7 pro.  Its is also depend on your taste.. i wanted the curve display.. minimum 256 gb storage and HD+ screen... Wsap charging.. good brand value and that too below 45000..That is what, one plus 7 pro all about...\\n\\n \\n\\n  I ordered as soon as was available. The phone looks beautiful, feels premium. The letdown begins when u start using it for a while. The fingerprint reader was easy enough to setup. But upon usage had issues. it didn\\'t work all the time. Lots of time the phone would just keep saying too many attempts & keep asking for pin. The pop up camera started having weird rubbing noise Everytime it was used.the phone calls had weird static distortion in them while they were quite clear on my iphone. I think they will release an update to fix it. The edges of the screen with the curve e resistance to touch and since the corners of the screen r more rounded than others, lots of time functionality was cut off. Like the voice message button in WhatsApp. The screen looked great with the 90hz display but unresponsiveness killed all the fun. It dosent matter if the screen is good . It might have a higher refresh rate but will still feel slow if the responsiveness is low. The camera quality was the most dissapointing aspect. Coming from iPhone the difference was quite apparent. The images seemed more granier and more saturated. The 3x zoom is underwhelming. Will probably install the pixel camera software as the stock software just dosent match up. But then the pixel phones have the best camera processing in the smartphone world.The battery is fine not great, but that was to be expected with the quad hd 90hz display. Roughly lasts 8to 9 hrs on average usage for me. Warp charge is a boon.Overall the price increase for the pro version does not seem to be justified. Too many trade-off. The one plus 7 which is not getting as much attention is a much better phone and more value for money. The difference in value proposition seems negilible between the two.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Screen : It\\'s really awesome.. 90Hz is silky smooth..Charging Speed : It does charge 50% inside 20 mins..Battery Life : 1.5 - 2 Days battery life for my usage.. It depends upon your usage..Camera : I don\\'t take selfie or photos that much, so can\\'t comment on it..Performance : It is really really fast..Sound : I do watch a lot of my content on YouTube i do feel the speakers are not that clear.. They are loud but not clear(Maybe it can be improved by changing the some setting or solve it in the next updates)My review : Overall i loved the phone.. If you are a normal usage phone person, then you will definitely love the phone b\\'coz of its 90Hz screen.. Some user will change the display setting to 60Hz, but if you start using it on 90Hz then there no way you will go back to 60Hz..Pros : As per my usage..#1 - If you use it for 30 mins and then take some another phone, you will not like the other phone.. You will fall in love with the display and once you start using it daily, you will not touch any other phone..#2 - Phone has a 1440 x 3120 pixels resolution and huge screen size, so if you watch a lot of content on your phone, You will love it..#3 - Performance is really fast..#4 - Definitely whole day battery life.. (1.5 day for me)Cons : As per my usage..#1 - As the screen size is huge, it is very difficult to use the phone in one hand.. You cannot type while chatting with one hand..#2 - Finger print sensor - I keep my phone inside my bag while driving, the screen wakes up so many times.. Accidental screens wakes up a lot..(Hope they solve this issue in next updates)#3 - Sometimes some apps do crash.. (It may be the choice of app i may use)\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very nice phone OnePlus 7 ProI liked the lookI liked the cameraI liked the body colour nebula blueBattery could be better because it decreases with full features onIf you play games it will drain moreBut for normal daily use also battery is not enough at 90 hz. I\\'m charging twice daily.I felt bad for no earphone and no premium hard back cover were provided in the box although transparent cover was givenBut in the end it\\'s nice to have oneplus latest mobile phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  Took for battery, but my OPPO f3 plus had a better battery life than this. No sensor on front of camera so when I try to talk while holding mobile, screen remains awake and calls get hold, record, mute automatically. Not worth of 43000 rs.. Camera quality is not good compared to its price. OPPO f3 plus has better image quality. OPPO f3 plus I took for 23000 rs.Extremely slow, takes minutes to load flipkart, Gmail, Amazon. Not worth for 15000 rs also. Looks like real China mobile, not tikau\\n\\n \\n\\n  The one plus 7 pro series has serious issue where the application gets stuck very frequently . Within the very first day of purchase I started facing issue with the performance . Moreover the Amazon return/replace policy is not transparant. The Amazon will not agree to replace / return the product even after providing several proofs.\\n\\n \\n\\n  My primary purpose of buying this phone was to buy a phone with premium finish and a good battery. I dont use the camera much, neither I play games.battery charges really fast, but this monster also guzzles it fast, so not able to hold the battery life longer.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am reviewing this smartphone after 1 month of usage. Battery standby is my only concern rest are all awesome.Pros:1) Display2) Stereo Speakers3) In-display fingerprint4) WARP ChargeCons:1) Battery stand-by could be improved2) Camera not up to the mark(but OnePlus is doing their best)\\n\\n \\n\\n  Don\\'t believe negative reviews  every thing is superb this is my 4th mobile from 1+.... Only one thing is little bit heavyweight\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone is over hyped. I had lots of expectations. I ordered twice. But not happy using this product. OnePlus is not able to meet the expectations of mine. I am trying to refund or replace with Samsung S10\\n\\n \\n\\n  First thing first, this is a Supreme Phone.I got this 8Gb/256Gb version for 40999 ( there were some other offers also - SmartBuy By HDFC made it even a better deal - 2000 worth vouchers more) . This phone justifies the price of 40K. It beats the Samsung and iPhone hands down in Display and aesthetics. Camera is tad bit inferior to Iphone Pro Max and Note 10 but the difference is marginal. Normal user will find it hard to notice the difference. Night Mode has been great with the latest software on.And yes, the User experience is better than Iphone. It took all these years for and Android phone to trump Apple in that regard. 90Hz refresh rate is not a gimmick, it makes every other mobile phone \\'feel\\' slow.Battery life is great, lasts a full day with moderate to heavy usage , even with that 4k (90Hz)  screen on. Lord knows how much it will last if it is turned down to 60hz FHD.Software is on par with iOS as far as usability and touch/feel is concerned. There is no news in  saying that  it is the fastest phone around.After the price cut it is the most affordable premium phone in the market today. Close your eyes, and go for it - you will not go wrong.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Fingerprint scanner is slower than previously used capacitive sensor. Picture quality is underachieved by oneplus. Battery drains fast even in this brand new phone. Elegance is super hot. Screen is a flagship and performs well up to the point. Changing takes more time then it was claimed , ufs3. 0 storage increases a bit of speed of data transactions. Nebula blue colour is innovative. Heptic vibration engine will feel just like an apple phone .\\n\\n \\n\\n  One Plus 7 Pro has brilliant specifications. Camera zooms upto 10x. Took a photo of the moon not a single pixelation in image when zoomed at 100%.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It is an average phone with a good display. Sound is good. Phone is very slippery and camera quality is poor with lacking clarity. Battery back up is average and worse than oneplus 6t. Buy op6t or op7. Do not buy op 7 pro.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Must buy this phone if you have a budget of 50K around- Camera excellent- Performance in gaming- Haptick feedback while gaming- Large 4K screen with 4k recordingJust the battery is a problem a big battery is ultimately used bu big display, but WRAP charging comes to rescue here.Ever thought your phone is watching you, not with this one as it has hidden front camera üòÇüòÇüòÇ\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\'nuff said. If you still have doubts, check the hundred or so review videos praising how good this device really is. If you are in the market for a premium phone but don\\'t want to pay the Apple Tax or Samsung Tax, just got with this phone.Note: if waterproofing is not important for you, consider Asus 6Z as well for a much lower price.\\n\\n \\n\\n  PROS:Great Displayprocessor SD 855Oxygen OSNice duel speakersGood cameraLower sar value (head:1.187w/kg, body:0.606 w/kg)HIgh amount of ram for great gaming experienceGood screen on time without using higher refresh rate or higher resolution.Wrap charger support for fast chargingUFS 3.0 Supports for faster file transfersCONS:No 3.5 mm headphone jack supportBattery capacity is low for max resolution and 90 hz displaySignal reception is not good like oneplus 6T\\n\\n \\n\\n  After rebooting first time battery goes down extremely fast. 40% in 35 min. After new update (2 GB) n battery saving on mode it works far better. I m little bit disappointed in camera section. Look wise its very good.Edit:- Battery life is one day. (Previously I owned Honor play which had 3750mah, but bttry life was 2 day)Selfie is very good.\\n\\n \\n\\n  You cant take your eyes off the screen. It gorgeous. And the selfi camera is a cool new trick. Over all a great phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  Let me start my review with cons first as most of pros are know:Cons in this phone are mostly subjective1.No wireless charging ( who cares).2.No 3.5 mm Jack ,well that can effect a few and can be a deal breaker.3.Its massive .. and may be very uncomfortable for people coming from 5inch screen.4.Camera of this phone is it\\'s probably as well as con.Image quality as told in YouTube reviews were completely true.Wide-angle photos are pretty crisp and contains enough detail48 mp camera is true gem and caputurs some stunning photos.Zoom lens is good as well.Issue is it\\'s potrait mode which I personally didn\\'t like as it takes pic in 2.2x zoom so you have to shift for taking potrait shots.and that\\'s a pain but as OnePlus added feature knowingly don\\'t think this will be fixed.Pros:1.its super fast and fluid.2.feels gem in hands.3.Camera quality is good under most situations.4.Beast in performance.5.Screen is something you will fall for immediately you look at it.YouTuber have there say...so use it to experience it yourself.\\n\\n \\n\\n  7pro is very good..1) sounds amazing üòçüòç2) display so sweet..3) game experience very good4) battery life very good5) world No1 speed phone üòòüòòProblem is headset no slot 3.mm\\n\\n \\n\\n  Phone is super smooth like described by company. Fingerprint reader is so fast but it can not detect your finger if finger is not properly on the sensor.camera quality is superb,you can zoom in and out using ultra wide camera and battery life is good but i expect charging speed much more faster because it is warp charger. It will take 1 hours and 30 minutes for complete charge. Besides that one con is also here which is 3.5 mm audio jack. People who use wired earphone need to buy addition connecter which is 3.5 mm to type c converter.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I got the device on 17th may and already i can see dust in my rear camera lens .They have taken my device and told will replace it in a week ,online it shows they carrying repair work .Its really not good product .\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s been just 4days I have buyed this mobile via Amazon & it\\'s having some problems like device getting restarted by its own sometimes takes mobile to boot menu applications doesn\\'t work properly I need an urgent replacement of device\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was so thrilled when i order and got this in hand. But after 2 weeks of full fledged use, this is my verdict. Overall usage of phone is good. Its smooth in operation, fast in processing. But i did not get the feel of the Pricetag it had..Camera: After using the Samsung Note series for almost  6 years, i was very dissapointed in the Camera.. Though they claim a higher PPi, the clarity of the photos are that pathetic for a long distance shoot as compared to a lower version of a Galaxy phone..Battery is not that great but better than Samsung. But still need to see how long that goes. maybe i will have to review again after 3-5 months of use on the battery part..As a brand i feel that Oneplus is too confident now that they have acquired a steady market now and they feel that now they can start cheating the customers.. For this hefty price - there is not even a headphone, the 6+T atleast came with a supporting cable for the Aux, 7+pro didnt even have that.. I still wonder whats the reason for this price tag..I Should have gone for the Iphone XR..This is my biggest mistake i have ever done in purchasing a phone over the years..  NOT WORT THE PRICETAG\\n\\n \\n\\n  Everything is good as expected. Upgraded from my 5T.The display and the haptics just blew my mind.Battery is also good. Giving 8.5 hours of screen on time on heavy use.Had an option of either this or the s10. I bought this and I\\'m very happy with my choice.Oneplus never disappoints!\\n\\n \\n\\n  The details of the design are absolutely amazing. Screen, camera and speed are key features of this phone. The speakers have a clean stereo sound. The transition between applications is very smooth. Overall a very good phone to have. One drawback, if you are looking for a handy set then you can opt out of purchasing this.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Still awesome products range by one plus..I am using one plus phone from last 4 year..but they never dispointed me..go for it..great quality,camera, battery backup all are Best\\n\\n \\n\\n  After nearly two months of usage I got a fair idea now the performance is avarage. Battery dries out very fast. If you are typing in anything in a app. Suddenly the app closes automatically. Finger readers sometimes need 2 to 3 touches to work. Camera is excellent as expected. Much more was expected as this was a pro model. But every avarage performance. Fixes should be provided to overcome issues.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I cant tell you how amazing this phone is! I have been using this phone since one month.I would just say, go for this phone and you will never regret buying this!My mind was flipping between k20 pro and oneplus 7 pro, review in various websites says that both the phones are almost same in every aspect except the range,my sister bought k20 and i got a chance to test the camera on both the phones with my own naked eyes, and what i found is the quality of pictures on oneplus 7 pro is something i have never ever seen on any smartphone, not even iphones.Apart from the amazing camera, there are alot other features that i wished to be present in my phone. The gestures work perfectly, touch works as smooth as butter.No phone heating even while playing games in highest quality graphics. Yes, it heats little bit when you play and charge ur phone at the same time, but that is acceptable as it does not happen in every scenario and little bit is fine considering the processor.If you have proper knowledge of how to capture a photo by setting uo the focus and other stuffs, trust me you will end up taking a photo just like a dslr camera.Haptic feedback is another amazing feature on this phone, it really takes the gaming to another level, it vibrates when there is a beat/bass in the sound effect, wow so amazing man!Dolby speakers is another legendary feature that will blow your mind! Two speakers are always better than one!The flexibility to change the screen resolution just like in pcs is another feature. If you are worried that 90hz refresh rate would consume more battery, oneplus proved it wrong! I have not noticed any unnecessary battery consumption by the screen! The android version 10 has given this phone amazing utilization of resources, intellegent analysis by android tells me if any website or app is consuming battery higher than expected, this is a much needed feature on a smartphone with tons of apps loaded in it just like mine.To be really very frank, i have used this phone vigorously since i bought it just to check the benchmark of this phone and has not yet disappointed me. The only cool stuff from oneplus i miss on this phone is the notification led, coz there is no hardware support for it, although oneplus has tried to use the screen as the notification led, but it needs improvement and development and i am expecting oneplus team to arrange something cooler for the led.I am fully satisfied with this phone and i am hoping oneplus would not discontinue this product or pushing the android upgrades else it would be a huge disappointment.Great job Oneplus team!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Android Setup keeps stopping. Error occurring everytime I try to start. It is highly disappointing to you know order the phone, wait for it to get it delivered and end up having it not even starting. All the hype that is created by marketing about One Plus seems to be absolutely fake. Very bad indeed.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am using this device from last 2 months and it\\'s seems good time to right my personal opinion about this device.Display is osm no doubt about it, and phone feel very premium in hand, but it\\'s very slippery so impossible to use without Case.Battery charging speed is osm but battery backup is not that impressive. I am a normal user just check my email and business messages and youtube nothing else.I bought this device around 44k and now price drop to 39999 in 2 months.THE BIGGEST ISSUE WHICH I AM FACING WITH THIS DEVIVE IS THAT IT SUDNELY STOP WORKING AND THEN WORK FINE AFTER 2 OR 3 MINUTE LATER. I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ISSUE WHY SO MANY OTHER USER ARE GETTING THIS AS WELL.Hope this review will be helpfull for other buys are well.\\n\\n \\n\\n  12 GB ram, the hell !! It\\'s a lot of speed. Amazing display, with 90 Hz refresh rate, that\\'s what a beast is.Love This phone, it\\'s performance is TOP NOTCH. But still needs some camera Improvements specifically  in low light conditions. In camera section it is still under my SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 9.Go for it guys if you are too a hardcore gamer like me.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my wife‚Äôs second oneplus and she is switching to this from an Oneplus 6. I would say this is the best flagship you would get at this price point.There are no second thoughts about it.The 90HZ display is probably the best in any smartphone right now.The camera is much improved than the older versions , battery life is good and the performance is top notch as usual.It still has a few cons though with not having wireless charging , a slightly sub par camera compared to the other higher end flagships and the lack of a pure ip rating.But at this price point you simply can‚Äôt complain.I would say if you are looking for the best bang for your buck smartphone this is the one you should go with without a doubt..\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0Pros:Performance is extraordinary, awesome camera and feel of touch screen is superb. Ergonomic 6is a plus.Cons:Delivered with bubbles between the screen and screen guard.Charger is very bad, looks like it is a used one. I\\'ve attached the video.Battery drains quickly even if it is used with single SIM and without gaming.Charging is expected to be quick as it has wrap charge, but in actual it is at par with normal type C.I don\\'t see pocket mode in this phone. My old phone 3T has this feature\\n\\n \\n\\n  Before i was using oneplus 6 that was also a great phone but after this I\\'m in love with it\\'s curved display.. Now my old oneplus 6 looks me dull as compared to this beauty.. Apart form display the camera quality also good. extra Wide angle sensor gives more area to captured, indisplay fp is very accurate & fast, powerful sd855 processor gives awesome performance, New 30 watt warp charger(faster than dash charger) took around 1hr to get device full charge(4030mhz) and last easily full day(6-7hrs sot).\\n\\n \\n\\n  Switching from OP3 to OP7 Pro. Handsdown Best display for the price, fantastic interface, moderate fingerprint reader and camera which i guess will improve with software upgrades( i am comparing the camera with pixel and s10+). Sound quality is awesome both on speaker and headphones as well. Built quality is awesome, no hassle with popup camera. Got 8gb+256gb variant. Battery is also good and wrap charger is saviour. Best phone at 52k.. cheers OnePlus. Never ever settle for less.Ram management is superb. HDR10+ is just fantastic for viewing contents on mobile( Amazon Prime, netflix etc).Delivery was as always awesome. Thank u Amazon for that. Keep up the good work.\\n\\n \\n\\n  pros:93% screen to body ratio :ofluid amoled 90hz displayoxygen osbeast in gamingwarp charging(55+ mins for full charge 0 to 100) and (30 mins for 0 to 70).cons:battery life ( if u use in qhd+ and 90hz, 4 hours 30 mins screen on time) or ( if u use fhd+ and 60hz, 7 hours screen on time). but then , this warp charging makes it a NEGLIGIBLE issue.fingerprint scanner is not so fast and accurate.......(well cant expect much from a optical fingerprint scanner.slightly heavier than a normal smartphone (well its huge.....)\\n\\n \\n\\n  Loved everything but one plus should increase battery backup. It i charged till 90% at morning and internet is on for day and just using normal whatsapp instagram then also it will drain and till 8o clock it will be 25%. But other MI mobile with same battery backup will last long for 1 and half day with same usage. Having speaker issue in less that 7 days..upset..\\n\\n \\n\\n  This product is a beast....with all the features and the 6.7\" screen with the 90hz makes it a perfect match for movies and video.....with the latest snapdragon 855 the phn is lighting fast......But not having a earphone or at least a type C to 3.5mm converter in the package was a bit of disappointment.Though the phn is not officially certified waterproof but from my previous one plus experience I could tell u it\\'s not much of an issue....the device is water resistant to a good extentLastly the camera .....the portrait mode is legit....it has an amazing field of view.....the primary lenses also does a pretty decent job.....but the ultrawide lens is not up to the mark.....the dynamic range is not good and the photo also looks a bit noisy.....so some research is required on that part...The front facing selfie camera also does a good job....my best SELFIE CAMERA by farOverall if u ask me it\\'s a pretty decent device to go with your daily activities and gaming; editing and other stuff like thatU won\\'t regret buying this..üòÑüòÑ\\n\\n \\n\\n  Finger print is very goodCamera good qualityBattery backup good\\n\\n \\n\\n  It has an amazing display and it\\'s buttery smooth with the 90hz refresh rate! The camera is a beast tho. Battery is decent. 6hrs sot once fully charged. And while gaming I get around 3-3.5hrs sot in fanatic mode while playing pubg! But people who are looking for more performance and better battery backup and smoothness, I would recommend them to go with Asus Rog Phone 2. By the way this review is from a long time OnePlus user and also Rog user! Peace. Have a good day! :)\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is hands down the fastest phone out right now and will be for the rest of 2019 and 2020 until Oneplus 8 comes out. Oneplus tinkers with Android OS to prioritise on speed. This phone would easily last someone 3+ years. The screen is absolutely stunning and the 90hz motion on the screen makes it one of the best screens out. Camera is also brilliant and takes amazing pictures. It\\'s got wide angle lens which I absolutely love. Similar to go pro. It\\'s also got standard lens which takes great photos on day and at night too. And a zoom lens. Battery life is also very good and would easily last a day. I never have to worry about storage since it has enough to store for over 2 years for me. Google photos backs up unlimited photos and videos for free so I don\\'t have to always keep photos in my device. So 256gb storage is an overkill and I love it. The price of this phone is a few hundred pound cheaper than others and is better to me! You would absolutely love the warp charger. It will charge your phone to around 50% in 20 minutes. It is a lot faster than Samsungs fast charge. The best part is that it will still charge fast even if you\\'re using the phone where as other chargers will slow it down a lot. I have zero regrets from getting this phone! Thank you Oneplus for making an amazing phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I don‚Äôt how they are charging so premium without quality,1+6t camera was so good so I thought of going for 1+7 pro but it‚Äôs not at all worth it I was using VIVO V15pro camera was much better simply I ve sold it for this worst phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  Pros:Kickass DisplayRegular Updates/patchesCons:Average camera. What\\'s the point of having a triple camera if apart from the main cam, the other two are below par.Battery life is very average given the size and price. Getting a screen on time of 4-6 hrs.Too heavy and bulky.My indian sim card had no signal in Europe for the whole trip while my wife\\'s OnePlus 5 with indian sim was able to latch on to networks in europe. Both of us use Jio.In display Finger scanner is a pain in the assFor the price I expected a better phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am using one plus 7 pro since the day it was launched in India. I am using the Mirror Grey version.I was waiting to complete at least 2 months before I post a review here.It is worth the money. So many people told me that the phone is looking great and asked me which brand it is.You will never go back to 60Hz refresh rate phones once you start using this 90Hz version.I admit that the phone is a bit heavier than the one which I was using before (Xperia Z5 premium), however, it doesn\\'t matter.4 K videos are just awesome, the camera quality is very nice.The Dolby Atmos feature and the dual speaker combo is my favorite.All these are the Pros of PRO.Now, I have the habit of finding the wrong things when I find something too good :D-  No headphones jack, they don\\'t provide the C-type headphones connector-  One plus wireless bullet earphones are always out of stock- Little heavier- Not that pocket-friendly\\n\\n \\n\\n  It is a complete package the only flaw is the 3.5mm jack but u should also consider the power this product packs so not getting a jack is understandable. Awesome camera quality and good battery life lasts me the whole day on only one charge the 90Hz display is the best thing in this device. I just love it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The One Plus 7 Pro exceeds expectations. Excellent seamless transitioning between apps and very good camera. Definitely worth it !\\n\\n \\n\\n  bang for buck... the hardware, the craftsmanship.. what a marvel this machine is...high speed surf-boarding is what comes to my mind every time I operate it...runs like the wind... this is truly the \\'master of all\\'... the cosmetic appeal, the functionality and the bumper cameras are drool worthy...All of it, packaged into a mirror grey body that u would yearn to hold in ur hand and grin at. üòÅ\\n\\n \\n\\n  Presenting the best phone is the budget presented the 90hz is a visual delight, no doubt the in screen fingerprint reader is a bit slower than the conventional methods, camera add an extra dimension to the photography it\\'s not just good it\\'s really good. Nightsight could be a bit better but still it has come leaps and bounds since the \\'dark ages\\' the battery life leaves more to be desired for but warp charge is the best thing to be adapted with in half an hour i can go from nay to gaming without thinking will the charge last or not.... It\\'s just the best...\\n\\n \\n\\n  It is worth it. Camera was not upto the mark before update, but it has improved a lot recently. And future updates will definitely make it a great shooter.Other than that you\\'ll love 90hz display, Fast, clean and uncluttered UI, and overall premium feel.Only issue is it is hard to find good cheap tempered glass atm and there is no official tempered glass from oneplus available yet.Overall, it is worth the money.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome phone. To start with pros, amazing design and the color nebula blue is nice. Camera quality is good for the price, never settle with the speed. Face unlock is slow as the pop up camera needs to open up and read the face and unlock also fingerprint is slow compared with OP6. Great phone for reasonable price.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am using this phone from 1 months must say this is the best smooth and fast phone i have ever used till datei think every one knows about its specs and looks so i dont need to tell about that allI just tell you about its brief battery lifeSo if you are going to use this phone for calls whatsapp and media consumption you will get 5 or 5 n half hrs of screen on time or you can increase a bit by lower the screen refresh rate and resolutionBut If you play PUBG in this mobile then it will give you max 4:30 mins SOT and if you use its fanatic mode then you will get 4 hrs of SOT if you lower its resolution and screen referesh rate then it increase a bit by 15 min or half an hours of timeYou will get Warp charger in the box which is 30w charger so you can full charge your device 1:30 hrsOve all its a gud purchase and after purchase i got 3 to 4 OTA updates and oneplus rectify its bugs and camera issues and lots of minor improvementsAlao if you are planning to buy this phone then buy one armoured case for the phone security aa phone is very slim and you can not handle without caseif budget is not your concern you can definitely go for it or else you can look for op 7ConsThe cons i have noticed is its weight,no ip rating and average battery life rest all looks perfect to me\\n\\n \\n\\n  Great product ... ultra smooth .. great build quality ... best smartphone in premium segment :)\\n\\n \\n\\n  Pros:1. Camera quality is superb2. Look is pretty stylish and decent with curve edges3. Processor is really fast and can be used for heavy gaming experience with 4k quality screen4. Smooth interface experience5. Fingerprint pretty fastCons:Battery drains really quickFingerprint doesn\\'t work sometimes\\n\\n \\n\\n  The screen is just amazing.Noholes,notches or gimmicks just the way I like it. Nebula blue is my new favorite color.The camera is the best compared to previous OnePlus products.The battery life is short but saved by the Warp Charge.All in all , an great smartphone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Loved this phone. The features included translate into a real world excellent experience. The 8GB RAM is more than enough. Using GCam with this improves photo quality, but one plus is also putting software updates. A solid phone that\\'s worth the money we\\'re investing in it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Just buy it if your budget allows. Everything is premium in this phone. Display, Camera, performance everything is great. I saw few reviews, people comparing camera with low end phones. The difference is the new AI feature with mid range phone which is just a software upgrade. AI camera images looks great but are automatically editing when clicked. This is the reason people feel some mid ranged phone phones camera are good but actually that\\'s not. That\\'s just a software they use.Taking that into consideration each and every thing is worth.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been using this device for the past 20 daysand I\\'m totally impressed with it.Onepluss 7pro is the fastest and smoothest android phone i have ever used. It really impressed me how smooth it is.In performance department it was the best and no doubt in it.I am not actually a camera guy but photos which i am getting are pretty decent.Coming to the battery life, it\\'s not so good. Decent battery life which can last a day for normal usage. Charging speed is really excellent.Display is one of the best but not \"the best\". Color accuracy is not on par with s10 plus but close to it. Though i would prefer oneplus 7 pro\\'s display since it has no notch and 90hz refresh rate.Sound quality and haptic feedback is greatly improved compared to it\\'s predecessor and on par with the flagship devices.Overall its an ultimate performer with best display and sound.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am using this phone from last  2.5 months.Likes:Oxygen OS from Oneplus is big plus for this phone. It is very stable varient of android available in the market.Fingerprint Scanner is very fast.Camera quality is decent.Battery life is also good that it last about a day with average screen on time of about 7 hours.Thanks to 30W charger which comes with it in the box.Phone is performing very good. I have used this phone for 800 hrs up time. But found nothing serious.Dislikes:Brand: OnePlus is giving awesome phone each time but within 6 months it comes with OnePlus 7T with better performance and features than OnePlus 7 Pro at lower price. They are not maintaining the value of their flagships. I have spent 58k for this phone and now I feels like I have paid for wrong device.I advice all to go for Samsung or Apple iPhones because they are maintaining value of their flagships for at least a year.Camera: It will miss some frames when recording in slow motion. Also there are many flaws in camera system which may be resolved with software updates.At last I will say that Amazon service was very poor. When I ordered this phone from Amazon, It was reached at Amazon\\'s local facility whithin two days. But As I am a non prime member, they took 2 more days for delivery. They were able to deliver the phone within 2 days but they didn\\'t.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Waited a long for it.. Been in love with the OP every since I got the OP 2.. Didn\\'t wanna settle for anything less so got the OP7 pro 12+256 gb variant..  Been using it for a month.. Looks amazing.. smooth to use.. feels premium üòç The Battery life is amazing.. I just charge it once and use it for the rest of the day.. Charges fasttttt.. The finger print sensor is not that great.. take multiple tries to read your thumb impression at times.. Video and music experience on the phone is astonishing.. stopped using my laptop for movies every since I got this.. the Dolby Atmos is a stunning.. However the camera, which was the main reasons for opting for this.. Turned out disappointing to a limited extent.. The rear camera does take beautiful images.. it does take a bit long to click.. The pop up camera, was saddening.. too much of Ai... The op2 and dvI feel took better selfies compared to this\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome display with smooth and speed... Camera was good at parts... If it is under 45k its a definitely flagship killer but now its a true flagship mobile... Once u r addicted to oxygen os then u should not satisfied with other os... Once again one plus continues its agenda...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Amazing display... Fluid movements in all apps when on 90Hz.Loved the improvement in haptic feedback helps in typing and to know about notification and calls on vibration mode.Over all awesome experience. Fast delivery by Amazon.\\n\\n \\n\\n  My online experience ruined. There was a defect in the display. Greenish in colour when I take pictures and videos or watch movies. I had taken to the service centre and they had replaced the screen. Investing so much of money, it hurts when things like these happen.\\n\\n \\n\\n  i m  loyal customer of one plus..and used 3,3t,5,6t n now i use one plus 7 pro but its have issue that phones brightnes reduce n increase automatically....i insure that oll the setting relatedto screen is ok....but still its have this issue .i think that it softaware or virios issue n format my phone ...but its have same issue that screen brightbess blawup any time......i frustrated n finnaly sale the phone with 40 % loss ...i used only 8 month n face this type of. issue.... i m one plus fan....but now i think i tranfer my self to other company.....one plus device has problem afrer 7 series....n quilty reduce from it.....i alredy send e mail to one plus. but they give no any reply...friends not go for oneplus 7 n 8 series.... otherwise u loss your hardearn money .i used one plus 5 from last 3 years no any issue .\\n\\n \\n\\n  There are few things i dont like about this product, first is it\\'s weight, this thing is quite a weight.Secondly, the camera is good enough for most people, but in low light, unless you use nightscape, the pictures are bad, otherwise the camera is very good (not excellent) in bright light scenes..Also, the battery is quite nice actually, but the last oxygenOS update ruined the battery life tbh, now it barely last a day, i have to recharge it again by the end of the day, to about 50% (the charging speed is really very very good!! Very fast charger indeed) but i last about 15-20% everyday by the end, PLEASE DO NOTE THAT I USE MY PHONE A LOT THOUGH, üòÇüòÖ SO IF YOU ARE A LIGHT USER, WHO CASUALLY USES YOUR PHONE, YOU CAN EASILY LAST A DAY EVERYDAY ON THIS PHONE, I USE ABOUT 6-7 HOURS EVERYDAY, SO THERE\\'S THAT...If u still want a better battery life, you can always turn the screen to 60Hz or maybe even lower the resolution from the settings to get better battery life...Also the screen is just amazing on this phoneüòçüòçüòç it\\'s just mesmerizing to look at!!!ü•∞ü•∞The performance also is amazing, haven\\'t noticed even a single hiccup in between using apps or anything like that..!!Overall, just close your eyes, and book it!!\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am giving 1 star for poor camera quality .The camera is too bad. My previous mobile LG G4 has excellent camera quality even though it is a 16 megapixels and 3 years old.How OnePlus can fix such a worst camera in their flagship mobile which are over priced at above 49k and they say it\\'s best camera.Its 48 megapixels camera not able to focus anything and the final image is blurry.Oneplus should fix this issue.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I buy this phone for it\\'s curved & full view display but there is other department also which should be considered.‚Ä¢Okay,battery life is average,not long lasting as mi or realme 3 smartphone (reason is 6.67 inch large & amoled display).‚Ä¢Run high graphic games smoothly with some heating but getting heated if you play pubg at ultra hd & extreme frame rates.‚Ä¢well camera pictures quality is average,not like in youtube videos sample but this should be okey because other than youtuber videos sample there is not so much difference b/wsamsung,oneplus,oppo,apple camera,But 4k video & normal video recording is very good.‚Ä¢Important thing is it\\'s oxygen os - it is good but not a hyped which many youtuber spread & there is no inovation in it.‚Ä¢Other cons is its lacking(absence) of inbult app locker because you can apply a password with screen lock but also use same password to lock your app which is not good for privacy point of view..So, this is my conclusion after using this for around one month._________________________________For display 5/5Back camera 4/5Front camera 3/5Gaming 5/5Sound 5/5Fingerprint reader 4/5\\n\\n \\n\\n  Undoubtedly this beauty deserves 5 stars without any doubt..! Man you got excellent camera with very good low light conditions, excellent picture Clarity in daylight and super selfie camera. Performance is top notch. 855 SoC is killing it. You got 90hrz refresh rate and 4k display wherein you can shoot and stream true 4k content with an ease which no other phones in this price segment can do. Battery life is good, as I\\'m fond of games, I play a lot of games and I\\'m satisfied with battery life. Special mention pop up camera- that stress test in YouTube which is for 12hrs straight clears everyones doubt on pop up cam. It is just perfect .\\n\\n \\n\\n  Don\\'t Buy This Phone Its Duplicate Product,It can\\'t Be Resistant Atleast One Cup of Water,I chested By Them, Believe Me Pls Don\\'t Buy This Product They Don\\'t care About us after Buy This Phone.I can\\'t Do Anything In this Time with This Phoneüòì.They Cheated Me With Duplicate Product üò´.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Pros: 2k AMOLED Display, 90 Hz refresh rate, OS, Hardware, fastest fingerprint reader, 33W fast chargerCons: camera(it\\'s not great but not bad either considering the price point) , No wireless charging (it not much of an issue for me as the super fast charging makes up for it), No head phone jack.Note: The battery is average I would say, I\\'m not a gamer, for me it lasts for a day considering my usage.*Would I recommend it or not?Definitely yes, if you seeking an android phone with great display and speed this phone is definitely for you. Moreover the oxygen os is cherry on top.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Hi sir , A kind request to you it\\'s been exactly 14 days since i have received the product ( one plus 7 pro ! Everything was fine working well . I updated the device to Android version 10.2 ! Within a span of 24 hrs the camera is not working apps get crashed in a while ! Not even a single scratch on the phone hereby I prefer my 3years old samsung s7 was much better with OS 6.0 - 8.0 , So please do help me out to solve this issue .\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome product ...again One plus shows it\\'s class and master peice of workmenship. Totally it feels great in hand...1. Design ...very good2. Battery life... Heavy use 10 hrs3. Camera Quality ...Best I have ever seen in this range of phone..4. RAM and ROM.  As per specification work5. Processor ...Actually very fast and with any lagging .In short I m very much satisfied with this phone after using approx one month.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone definitely looks great due to its big screen, 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. But it sincerely lags in Camera department even after updates. Video Recording, Voice Recording are great but i am not sure for some reason pics from its front camera just looks average and lacks true colors. Infact, my previous phone Redmi Note5 Pro used to click better selfies. Battery drains quickly if you use 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. Luckily, it has a warp charging adapter with it. Although, the phones gives you premium feel at a premium price but One Plus should look into the Camera Software updates. It\\'s no where near to that of Pixel, Note series or Huwaei premium phones in terms of camera. Except for camera, this phone is a rockstar.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s extraordinary, only thing which is lagging when compared to Apple and pixel phones is camera. Nonetheless camera are also really good. Not to mention batter life is also good but not spectacular. Major pros of this phone are Display, performance, software, build quality and charging speed which is on another level. Over all very satisfying experience with this product. Well done OnePlus ! And I still miss the headphones jack !\\n\\n \\n\\n  Review after eight days of heavy use:Blazing fast.Fabulous screen.No heating.Transfer 25 GB of data from leptop in just 15 minutes .ConsBit heavy and uncomfortable for one hand use.Except it definitely buy it\\n\\n \\n\\n  The performance of this phone is simply phenomenal. I opted for the 256 GB + 8 GB RAM option. With an uncommon screen refresh rate of 90 Hz ,scrolling through applications and switching between them is fast and buttery smooth. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is very fast and rarely misses on the first try. The edge to edge screen is huge and very emersive; being a class leading Samsung AMOLED screen colors are rich and vibrant. Using the pop-up selfie camera is both clever and fast. The camera quickly emerges from it\\'s cubby hole and quickly returns. The phone can instantly detect when it\\'s in free fall and will quickly and automatically retract the camera to avoid damage. A lot of reviewers lamented this phone\\'s lack of official water resistance rating. The phone is definitely water proof. I have had it exposed to pouring rain and placed it on wet surfaces without any issues.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Writing this review after 1.5 monthSo guys the 90hz screen the best part you will definitely call in love with it from the day one it\\'s buttery smooth with sd 855 man it\\'s a beast playing HD games feels great on this phone.Charging is also fast ever morning I plug my device and I get my device all juiced up before leaving office in about an hour.Although it has no 3.5 mm headphone jack but you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy the c type bullets available at OnePlus website (they are awesome) or but the connector available at OnePlus website, so stop making a fuss about 3.5 mm jack (u are spending around 50k here, go buy a decent headphone too).Camera after the updates improved a lot and now pictures are quite good, still there are some issues with lowlight photos but in proper light the photos are good. Front camera selfie is also good no issues with that.Overall a nice phone, a bit overpriced (after looking at the price of k20 pro üòõ) but yes it\\'s still the flagship killer and way better than many of it\\'s competitors.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am using this device for around a week. These are the things I came across:1.) Display is very big. It is okay for me but single hand operation will be difficult if you havent got big enough hands.2.) This device is heavy. Again for me the weight was okay but it might not be for u.3.) Low light camera performance not amazing.4.) Otherwise camera performance is very good.5.) RAM management is excellent .. didnt come across any lag issues or frame drops while playing.6.) Charges really fact and have a good enough screen on time(for me).There are minor issues which i believe they will fix with upcoming updates and YES they either should have provided a headphone jack or some connector for my wired headphones. This is expected as u are pricing something around 50k and also not proving wireless charging and waterproof certifications......this is kinda upsetting.But yes it is a good device. It will give you the best performance and yea looks amazing. Except that jack issue I dont have any other complains.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Everything will fine.But it was left from my hand and it‚Äôs curve display will broke. I was disappointed by its quality company says it has gorilla glass but it did not protect your phone it is just for marketing.I am unhappy by it‚Äôs screen built quality.I am going to service center to repair it and this product has very expensive display around 16500.So guys it‚Äôs true if you purchase go for it but take care of your phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Wireless bullets can give for 12gb ram 58,000/- paying customers. You are simply avoiding...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Everything is Soo good.. and trust me this is exceptional display.. blew my mind.. feels super premium.. still needs optimizations in camera and fingerprint and some bugs.. but good hardware and super fluid.. just eliminate some bugs to make this perfect...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got phone with exchange of my OnePlus 5T in 30KLoved the phone overall.Case provided with is not so good,kill the look of phone .No type c to audio jack converter in box (received with6t)The phone slipsssss.it just slip no matter where u kept it in ur hand, table or sofa. If u kept ur phone on slopping surface,u will found ur phone on ground.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Really one of the best phone available in market. I was bit confused b/w XR and 7 pro..and i feel that i made a correct decision by opting this blue beauty. Phone looks are stunning...fingerprint is awesome..rear camera is good and front is average...90hz screen refresh rate make its usage flawless...No need to spend heavy money on iphones..simply go with this and make your self owning a ultra premium beautifull phone..\\n\\n \\n\\n  There is nothing to dislike about this product. I\\'m in love with it. The colour, the haptic feedback, the feel, the screen, the software, they blend together to give that smooth experience that I was expecting. Never doubted it and never settle.\\n\\n \\n\\n  1, Display is excellent2. Battery pretty average, drains very fast.3. Camera - you cant compare with Apple and Samsung. Low quality lenses used. Even mid range smart phones perform better.  Nowhere near flagship camera. Oneplus has to work on this front.4. Since price is not cheap anymoreDesign : 4/5Battery : 2/5Build  : 4/5Performance : 4/5Camera : 2/5You need to carry power bank with you or wrap charger. I doubt, even 30W wrap charger not sufficient.Dissapointed with purchase. But 43K, it\\'s no where match to other phones.\\n\\n \\n\\n  New version of one plus...great build quality but once again battery is a serious disappointment...if u use 4g data your üíØ% charge becomes 90 in 15-20 min, otherwise great to use...I am not they have optical image stabilization...hope they have as getting jarred ü§≥ even at the lightest jerks\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality is awesome, specially the nightscape mode. Pictures in night are much better than any other phone. Fingerprint read is also good just the thing that sometimes it does not detect may be due to lots of fingerprints on screen cover. Battery life is really great. Once charged you can use it throughout the day.Display is really awesome specially the infinity display. All things look much beautiful in one plus 7 Pro becz of such good display.I think one plus should have provided headphone jack connectors, as there is slot for it and we are able to use one plus 6t\\'s connector, so there\\'s no use of not providing the connector, or else they should provide free Bluetooth earphones.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought OnePlus 7 Pro(6GB, Mirror Gray)  from Amazon on 4 October 2019 in \\'Amazon Great Indian Sale.Seller Name - Rocket Kommerce LLPOn 9 Oct, my Phone delivered and I was doing the initial setup.Suddenly an error occurred that showing \"Android Setup Keeps Stopping\" and Nothing happens. I stucked on this error screen. after restarting many times I did a factory reset and able to get home-screen.1.  After getting an error on Brand New Phone on initial setup, I am assuming that this phone is tampered by the seller and contains fake parts.2. when I ran speed test(Read&Write) of internal storage. The results are way less than actual ufs 3.0 storage even half.read & write speed is same as ufs 2.1. It means internal storage is tampered or defective.after this whole incident, I am very disappointed by Amazon.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality  4.5/5Battery life  4/5Performance  4.5/5Fingerprint reader  3.5/5Looks(Nebula blue)  5+/5Top feature  Nightescape modeOneplus always comes with the flagships phones and breaks down the market every time.Best thing about OnePlus is Premium quality, and always proves why OnePlus is the best android phone.It can be compared with Iphones.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Everything is cool in Device but due to 90hz screen referesh rate the battery consumption is high but that is not a problem because it\\'s warp charger is beast.I bought this for gaming purpose it\\'s a beast Device for gaming. Continuously getting 58-60 fps in Battle Royal games it\\'s make me crazy while playing games in this device.Overall comparison to other devices in this range it\\'s a best Device for me.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It\\'s a good mobile . Very smooth with super screen and good camera.But this is not what one plus is. It\\'s over prised.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Nothing like this. My priority was performance and this has met above expectations with Snapdragon 855. It\\'s been almost a month using OP 7 Pro and it\\'s working like a charm, you will fall in love for its speedy in-display finger print scanner, multi-tasking and last but not th leat the 90 Hz butter üòä screen. A bit improvement in camera is needed for photos and even slowmos in artificial light. Finally it\\'s a masterpiece!\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is hands down great... Don\\'t just fall for youtuber\\'s saying camera softens pics or there is oversaturation or speaker isn\\'t good enough or the fact that fingerprint sensor isn\\'t fast because it is fast...Everything in this phone is straight up great the display, speaker, camera, speed everything except for the wide angle camera.. which is good at best because when you switch cameras from main to wide the saturation brightness contrast changes  with the later being a bit washed out... While takin wide angle pics of a building and scenery is just great.. the wide angle picture of a person withe the scene in background is just pathetic...there are distortions like the limbs of the person become longer (yes you read that right) the skin tone is straight up washed out... Updates haven\\'t been able to fix this yet but apart from wide angle camera this is worth the extra bucks\\n\\n \\n\\n  Happy to have this phone. .. tried for 12+256 got this. .. This is the first shots of My 7 pro. . Will update other reviews. . Hope 1+ delivered what they promised. . Will try my gaming and update on the performance. . Screen is incredible... to get on to it now. .. I am impressed. ..\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0Totally Waste Ordered a mobile oneplus 7 pro I received a product with totally faulty device. After returning that I got a another now should see how this device perform in day to day life. I hope it would not perform well. 1st impression on oneplus only got disappointed.\\n\\n \\n\\n  One plus is milking Indian consumers by offering step by step variants.This phone is poor in battery and attract scratch very eaisly.Due to curves , it\\'s not easy to apply tempered glass on phone and most of the shopkeepers struggle on this.Overall expectations are not met.Better you buy 1 plus 7t because 12 GB Ram is not actually active 12 GB Ram which we have tested.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Overall..I would rate it a 4 star phone which has offered a lot however price is bit on a higher side. Would have been a great deal to cap at under 40k.Front pop up camera needs improvement10x Zoom is a superstar. You could see an image which was zoomed and clicked. To your surprise this shiv-linga was 500 meters away from where I clicked this image.Rear camera sometime does wonderful job but still needs better quality as you would be spending approx 50kAnother pic of Lord Hanuman is a proof that rear camera is good but needs improvement\\n\\n \\n\\n  Best in class than compared to other brands for the same specs, many bugs are solved on frequent updates and hope camera quality also improves with future update.Finger print reader is fast and simply amazing.Battery life is good, the best thing is warp charge. So any where you are get it charged within 20min and more than 80% of your battery gets ready, for safety purpose get yourself screen protector for the phone first, since the display is one which gets affected in case of any physical damage. Hope the after sale service is also good by oneplus.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Best phone I\\'ve ever used.I had been using OnePlus 5 before this and that was what made me a fan of that company. Seamless experience with a superb camera. Helped me a lot on my trip to the US. Check out a few shots.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality is very poor. Being a premium phone, the One Plus brand did not pay much attention on primary camera. The primary camera comes with 16MP, but the resolution is not as expected. The selfies taken by MI is far better then the one captured by this phone. The One Plus brand should take this feedback very seriously and try to fix it up by providing some updated camera software updates.Very much disappointed as far as camera is concerned.The package lacks the Type C USB to audio jack converter. The One Plus should take up this feedback and include the one in the pack.As far as battery back up is concerned, it is very good. Luckily I did not get carried away by other reviews on Amazon :).\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality has been improved drastically over the last few updates.The device feels premium.The indisplay fingerprint is preety fast.The warp charge is very quick and oxygen is feels smooth as butter.Preety good deal for the price if comes to S10+ which cost around 70k mark.\\n\\n \\n\\n  A killer flagship !!Display is out of the world with this 90hz panel. It feels buttery smooth.The warp charge is mind-blowing. It could get me to a full charge in an hour.Finger print reader is pretty accurate and also the pop up face unlock is a head turner.Audio quality,Call quality,Video quality,Ram management,Network Coverage all are as expected and is perfect.The camera is kind of good, I mean the primary 48mp and the 16 mp pop up camera are great to use, but the wide angle and telephoto do need a lot of improvements. The portrait mode could also be a bit improved.The battery is not terrible, but should carry around the charger if travelling for a day.The phone is pretty huge and heavy, but don\\'t know if that\\'s much of a big deal.Overall a futuristic smartphone with pretty descent value for money. I definitely bought this device over the regular one plus 7 for the screen and it\\'s obviously worth it. Add a warp charge that can give a full charge in about an hour, a very satisfying haptic feedback, a definite head turner popup cam, triple cam setup and it\\'s very much a value for money flagship !!\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have got 2 OnePlus 7 Pro in my family right now.One in Mirror Black and another in Nebula Blue (Both are 8gb/256gb models). As far as looks are concerned, both the colors look fabulous. Nebula Blue looks strikingly beautiful.Specs sheet can be obtained from the description box, so I ain\\'t gonna discuss about it. Review will be purely based on the user experience.Things I like:1) Looks- I\\'m gonna say it again and again, this phone looks stunning. As soon as you take this phone in your hand, you will feel that you didn\\'t dump your money in garbage. This sure looks and feels premium.2) Software- Oxygen OS works like a charm on this phone. No lags, nothing. It\\'s super clean and useful and highly customisable. You\\'ll get regular updates (august security patch was delivered to this phone even before pixel phones which is mind blowing) with a promise of 3 years of future updates.3) Camera- I\\'m currently on the Oxygen OS version 9.5.11 and believe me when I say, the camera is not a regular Joe. It performs well in all lighting conditions. All the three lenses are very useful in taking different kind of shots. Nightscape is fantastic. The camera app has been given several tweaks with regular OTA updates and it\\'s always getting better.4) Hardware and build quality- Phone has excellent hardware. Throw any app/games on it and it will run as smooth as butter. RAM management is also very good. Battery runs through an entire day and I have noticed some improvement in battery life after the last update. On an average, I\\'m getting around 5.5-6.5 hrs of screen on time, which is decent. The phone surface is quite slippery, I was keeping it without back cover, but the sixth drop made me realise that I should put the cover back on. The phone is still not damaged but there are some minor scratches around the corners.Overall- Build quality is superb.I would highly recommend this phone to someone who wants a high performance phone with quality hardware.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Though I liked the phone very much, I was shocked to note that there was no User Manual. I checked online too but not available online too. When I contacted Oneplus for the same, I was informed that manual must be inside the box or I should contact Amazon from where I bought the phone. Unfortunately I can not find a way to contact Amazon and as a result, I am not in a position to use my Phone fully.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I just brought it 15days ago and one plus 7T got released with same features and 20000 less price and it has fallen from just 35cm and screen got broken.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Will keep it concise & helpful:Oneplus has successfully manufactured a device, very capable in almost every aspect; here are the pros and cons though:Pros:1. Sturdy & beautiful built2. Immersive screen(even at 60Hz its beautiful, 90Hz just takes it to the next level)3. Loud sound & crisp, clear voice( in voice calls)4. Blazing fast...Never hangs or freezes...5. Camera hardware is top notch!6. Perfect weight distribution, feels so great to even hold it.Cons:Battery\\'s just an average performerFingerprint reader takes a few days/weeks to calibrate.Camera software should be tweaked and improved, hardware has a lot of potential\\n\\n \\n\\n  Excellent phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I waited patiently for a month to buy the Almond edition and by god it was worth it. The beauty of this variant is very difficult to capture in photos, it really needs to be felt first hand.Coming on to the device itself, it is a monster, in every way. The battery is pretty good, fingerprint sensor works most of the time, vibration motor is amazing, 90 hz is the Trump card. Everything about this phone is spectacular except:The fact that OnePlus have decided to skip the headphone adapter in the box. I covered myself in this regard by buying it before the phone itself but it has been out of stock ever since. There is no reason to omit it from the box.OnePlus has said that it is splash proof, but an official IP rating would have been nice.I don\\'t use wireless charging but for a phone that costs 50k, it should have been there. But I understand OnePlus\\' point of view that it is better to do it properly.Wide angle video missing, coming as a future update, portrait mode uses telephoto lens.Overall the best phone you can lay hands on.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I would be more than happy if someone help me to report all issues i am facing with device to one plus 7 pro authority.I think the device i am using is not up to the mark as it\\'s performance is very poor as compared to OnePlus6,  OnePlus6t, OnePlus7 and other OnePlus7Pro,  may be it\\'s defected piece.Everytime while using almost every application like FB,  Netflix or any other the device is getting freeze and personally i don\\'t think so that is common for oneplus device when you have 256GB ROM and 8GB RAM out of which 100GB is available to use.My friends who are using OnePlus6,  6t or OnePlus7 giving them better performance as compared to my device i. e.  OnePlus7Pro.Camera quality for my device is very poor,  unclear and not up to the mark.Portrait feature is not working properly.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera is awesome. Display couldn\\'t be any better. Processor is good. A bit big screen to handle. Finger print sometimes doesn\\'t recognize. Very smooth to operate. Only drawback is the battery. It drains a lot for 4000 mah capacity. It will still last around 24 hours without games.\\n\\n \\n\\n  After 5 months of usage this phone is great. And i feel this is a better phone than OP 8 for price and specs. It should slow down only through updates. Solid performance and best battery performance with super fast charging.Pop up camera is the best for privacy as i actually don\\'t use front cam mostly and will getting full screen with any notch and punch holes.Bought it for 43k 256GB + 8 GB Ram\\n\\n \\n\\n  Phone is excellent but there are some cons also which are 1) No Earphone (only Bluetooth)2) Warp charging doesn\\'t work ... For me in 20min it charge only 35%Battery backup is also not that great while playing games.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is good but there are too much software issues in OnePlus 7 pro feeling very bother on purchase of 7pro. This problem is not solved until the developer\\'s team of OnePlus do something too much software issue in this device. Finally waiting for good and stable updates.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It was slightly better than all basic Chinese phones..like Mi note6/7 pro.. but a big miss in VOLTE CALLING /VOWIFI feature is not available even in oneplus 7pro models.. big disaapoinment at huge cost. Don\\'t buy unless you don\\'t want to use VOLTE or VOWIFI features..as this phone overpriced with lack of VOLTE calling features..in India..Also basic headphone jack converter should be given along with the inbox items after all we are.paying huge money.. company is not interested to give us the headphones .or wireless headphones even..I have a feeling of wasting 52,999 rupees in it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Nothing\\'s beats the price point OnePlus is giving. Build quality is awesome. As far as the camera concern, you better get Gcam mod. Talking about the battery life you can get two days battery if you are using your phone for recieving calls and a bit surfing. I spent whole day in tracking and shot 400 beautiful pictures of mountains covered in clouds and a few stunning slow mo videos. Even after a whole day of photography and sharing my pictures, I left with 40% of battery in my phone and that\\'s fantastic. Just love this phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Only 1 word its just \"AWESOME\"I read some negative reviews for camera performance, but im really very happy with the camera n will give it a 5*. Only the thing i didnt like is the scratch guard and back cover provided is so cheap in quality\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very disappointed with the product.After 2 weeks of heavy reaserch, decided to buy this product.Bought **oneplus 7pro** on November 26, reviewing after 6 months.Mobile has huge software issues:1. Right after signing in to mobile, first game i tried to install was PUBG. Due to some software issue, game download from Play Store kept strucking at 2 percent. Some other apps got stuck at 90 percent.But, most of the apps got installed fine. I reinstalled the OS to see if the problem gets solved, but no!2. 90 hz display looks good most of the time (70 percent of the time). Other 30 percent of the time, it lags a lot. I don\\'t think I even got 10 hz at those times. It mostly lagged while scrolling apps, browsing internet, e.t.c3. Screen doesn\\'t go off to sleep after 30 sec. Of inactivity, as specified in settings,. We have to force it most of the times by clicking power button.4. Haptic feedback doesn\\'t work more than half the time. Some times it works for 10 mins or so, and stops working for the next 2 - 3 hours.After some many times of updating and reinstalling OS and apps ***PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS***\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone is best till date from OnePlus.Camera quality - 4/5Battery life - 3.5/5Display - 5/5Fingerprint reader - 5/5Performance - 5/5The 90 Hz display is just awesome but consumes more battery, and it\\'s worth it. Camera could have been better but I\\'m overall satisfied with the camera because I believe it\\'s not about the tools when it comes to photography.The infinite curved display with stereo speakers give the best viewing experience when it comes to watching movies / series on the phone.Simply, go for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Powerful delivery by Amazon one day prime dayThe phone is very beautiful design vise color is lovely sleek design Pop up Camera is very fastAll the specs were mind blowing\\n\\n \\n\\n  Well being a OnePlus user from the 5th Generation of their models, I would say they\\'ve come out to be one of the best players in the competition.Talking about the Display it\\'s fantastic, you would love to use this device all the time when it is in your hand. I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s big, but rather it\\'s immersive. And rhe refresh rate is just the icing on the cake.The battery life is also nice, much better than I thought as a day would be enough for a heavy user, and there\\'s no need to worry as the Warp Charger is there to help you out.Now the main weakness on of this phone is the camera. Well it\\'s not that bad but it\\'s not what everyone would expect from a OnePlus device for the premium pricing, well it\\'s kind of descent, much more similar to the previous generations, just the wide angle lens is the main centre of attraction.And at last the built quality and performance, hands down, unbeatable!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Let\\'s get the cons out of the way. I noticed mainly 3 things that may concern buyers.1. Form Factor- The size and weight of this phone is too big. Even if I have bigger hands.its impossible to use in one hand. You will get used to the weight but when u pick up other devices u will feel OnePlus 7 pro could have better weight balamce. It may pain a little if u are lying down and watching any video for a long time.2. Battery life - on paper 4000 mAh battery looks good.but it\\'s battery back up is average. I am getting little more than  4 Hrs screen on time. U can increase the battery by turning off 90 hz . Buts what\\'s the point of turning it off while 90 hz is the reason u r buying this phone.3. No always on display- Coming from Samsung phones I really miss the always on display features. Thought it has ambient display but u can never see notification unless u touch the phone. Don\\'t know why OnePlus did not give this feature. At least give a option to turn it on or off.Now let\\'s talk about advantages of this phone.1. Display- oh boy.u can enjoy this beauty of display all day long. Quad Hd 90 HZ amodled display is stunning. Once u use 90 hz other phones will feel slow and that includes iPhone too.yeah u heard that right.2. Sofwtwere experience- oxygen Os is so close to stock Android and in some cases it it better. Buttery smooth animation and super quick Android updates makes it one of the few devices having Android 10 at the time I am writing this review3. Sound Quality- This phone does have a decent dual stereo speaker which gets very loud. Audio quality is great also has Dolby Atmos support.4. Haptic feedback - I did not think earlier vibration  motors are to be considered as an advantages. But this phones vibration feedback is precise and strong. U will feel joy typing on this phone for sure.5. I was sceptical about this phones camera because many reviewers said camera is the weakest point of this phone. But I found the main 48 mp sensor as good as S10, iPhone 11 level. Though it\\'s secondary cameras lacks behind those flagships.  U can tweak the photos little bit and will get excellent result. One plus nighscapeobe is brilliant. Better than Samsung\\'s night mode.6. Performance - Snapdragon 855 and adreno 640 is more than capable of heavy tasks and gaming and this phone is no exception. Never faced any lag. That\\'s it.Verdict- The pros overweights the cons by very long margin. If u can manage the weight or size this phone will bring a smile on your face. Thanks.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got a faulty screen... Thanks Amazon for a delayed but complete replacement.After abt 2 weeks...Great device at its price. 90hz display and 1440p at hdr are very battery hungry... Also to protect the oleds... max brightness is controlled in manual brightness setting. Auto brightness may help in broad daylight but may burn the oled with prolonged periods of usage.Rest is all good performance, speakers, charging.No heat issues even with full performance gaming.Included case is very cheapish in appearance.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera Quantity very dispointed me very bad when campare to my one plus 6TNo clarity photos very sad,Especially potriet mode it crops and zoomy and also sheks,48mp it\\'s only in pro mode  not in default mode,3x zoom Very bad its not worthy no clearty photos also.Battery life ok ok not upto the markWe r giving almost 50k it\\'s not worthy for this phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  Just getting use to of its supersonic speed. Excellent build quality with the Qualcomm snapdragon 855 processors. Triple wide angle lenses gives you a variety of choices without making it much difficult for naive like me. It\\'s a better deal than any other flagship phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Top spec premium mobile in less price. Ultra smooth experience with 90hz refresh rate.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Upgraded from my lovely OnePlus 5... although not a single problem in it. And am not regretting it.Fluidic display is just awesome best in this price range. Good camera quality.Clear stereo speakers.Super fast professor. I am just Loving it. And i also got free 1year extended warranty.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Amazing device that\\'s worthy of all the attention it can get from anyone looking at it. You\\'ll instantly fall in love with the display and the speed of the device. Exceptional build quality and design. 100% Flagship level device with no compromises, given the price. Extremely delighted to be using this mobile.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Undoubtedly the Best right now!!üëçüëçüëçIts fastest phone that I have ever experienced. There are no hiccups, none what so ever. Overall smooth experience between switching apps and regular functions.The Display is to die for.Magnificent Night mode in camera wide angle.There is just nothing wrong with it.Overall an overwhelming experience.PUBG runs flawlessly ...The phone is so fast it takes some getting used to.Charging speed as advertised.No Complaints.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0Phone is not processing ahead seems like refurbished phone has been give.. Asking to reboot the system again... Have uploaded the video of whole process.When asked to replace said technician will check first which they can not arrange by tomorrow.Have killed my excitement like anything..Have uploaded the stupid video while talking to stupid CS\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is one of the best in the market worth the price. The only complain is it\\'s to heavy 4G only in Indian market, lake in wireless charging, can have a better battery capacity. Also kind of a need suit for PC for better connectivity. Overall a good phone in market at present. Feels premium to use especially for people upgrading from xiaomi MIUI to OnePlus.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Display is awesome. Buttery smooth touch. Samsung\\'s display looks better cz of the color vividness and saturation. But this one is one of the best display. Processor? 855 sd no need to say more about it. Sound is supergood but still searching for earphones suitable with this device. Just disappointed with the camera. Wide angle is just useless as it has lower angle of view and when you zoom into clicked image its blurry. Same with normal pic. It looks good until you zoom. Pics clicked are not sharp they r soft and blurry. Even redmi phone 15k priced clicks sharper pics than this. 4k 60fps video is certainly something it saves this phone as clarity is really superb. Battery backup is below average for the price you are paying for this device but super fast charging makes up for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0I don\\'t think Amazon has sent me a original and brand new phone. The screen doesn\\'t respond to touches most of the times and the fingerprint doesn\\'t work already. I had the one plus 5t and didn\\'t face any such issues but the customer care checks it for 5 seconds and says it\\'s okay but it\\'s really not working well. The fingerprint reader is slow. The screen doesn\\'t respond. And Amazon doesn\\'t help either\\n\\n \\n\\n  Really fastest mobile in the world ... Stunning camera . Good stability at high zoom .. water-resistance . Awesome battery with fast warp charge.ultra level display , really more smooth .. gaming fnatic -mode is really impressive for gaming. Dolby sounds can feel u like in cinema. Fastest finger print unlock ever... Compared iPhone and Samsung , OnePlus 7 pro is really at the best price\\n\\n \\n\\n  Proximity Sensor stopped working within 10 days of arrival. Fingerprint sensor is not at all quick. Battery life is pathetic. Speakers have some aberration coming out of them. Phone heats up all the time. I don\\'t understand the point of launching a costly phone with lower performance.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I got Nebula Blue 8GB variant. Awesome speed with matching 90hz smoothness. Camera quality needs improvement (I hope they will improve camera quality in future OTA updates). Battery life is pretty good. I play Pubg and Asphalt and battery lasts for a day. Display so buttery smooth that I cant take my eyes off it.Fingerprint sensor is way too fast.Very happy with overall performance of the phone.Can be improved:Camera qualityBack case. Default one looks like cheap one and destroys overall look of the phone.Default screen guard. (dust magnet)\\n\\n \\n\\n  Disappointed with Amazon delivery as I had to wait 6 days for the delivery of the device after making payment in advance. The wait was worth it. The phone is bundled in a premium box with a letter from the founder and invitation to join the OnePlus forums. This was a nice touch.Retail box: Box contains the device, warp charger, documentation, SIM eject tool and a clear silicone phone sleeve. Headphones and/or USB type c to 3.5 mm jack is missing. 4/5Design: I ordered the nebula blue version of the phone. The front of the phone is all display with minimal bezels. The curved front gives a premium appearance to the device. The back of the device has a frosted blue glass finish. The back is resistant to fingerprints while the front is a fingerprint magnet. The phone has stereo speakers with the earpiece above the display functioning as one of the loudspeakers. The bottom firing speaker is present on the bottom bezel of the screen. The loudspeakers are loud and produce pleasant sound.Display: the QHD 90Hz HDR AMOLED display is a gorgeous work of art. The display is buttery smooth and the experience of interaction with the curved screen is a joy. The embedded in display fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurate.Camera: the front popup camera is a fixed focus unit. It produces bright images with adequate amount of details. The front camera is good for video calls. The back 48 MP camera is good in bright light conditions. Produces noisy images in low light conditions. Using GCAM or nightscape mode helps render usable night shots. The wide angle camera is a nice addition but the rendition and the amount of resolved detail are inadequate. The telephoto camera helps create 3x lossless zoom. The resolved details are usable for social media but not good for prints.Performance: the phone is blazing fast. The 8 GB RAM is more than adequate for day to day usage. The on board storage is blazing fast. The OxygenOS is a great implementation of android that is fast and has many usable additions to stock android.Battery life: The battery lasts 2 days with my daily usage involving 1 hour of web browsing, 1 hour of streaming videos and about 1 hour of phonecalls. The bundled fast charger is great. It charges the battery to 80% in 30 minutes.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Amazing in every possible way. While everything is top notch quality, the screen is just mesmerising and completely notchless. Loving every bit of it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Best one from One Plus. Earlier I was using One Plus 6 and was planning to buy new phone. Have surfed a lot for buying now phone and then finally decided to go for this. No issues till date after using it for one week. Battery life is good and better than one plus 6.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Product is awesome... There is nothing to say bad about product... But delivery was not that good.. They said guaranteed delivery but they lated the product\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome looking mobile, on a heavier and bigger in size.I bought Almond colour, i would best looking smartphone out there dated Feb of 2020.Got updates, which seems to have sorted out previous bugs.Not a great fingerprint scanner as compared to previous generations on Oneplus, don\\'t use the graphicsBut they have very good customer service centre so i would any day go out there for a repair.Amazon Now, prime now that i used, i got my mobile delivered in 2 hrs which is top notch.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone is just awesome. Few people are telling that there were 2 additional cover and one Bluetooth headset. But it not there. This is not the truth. It was a reviewers pack. Specifically made for reviewing. So yo cannot compare this to that packet.Pros1 Camera quality2 Flagship Snapdragon 855 specially for gamers3 Fluid display with Qhd+ resolution\\n\\n \\n\\n  OnePlus has resolved the below bug üëç however the camera quality and audio quality is still not good enough for speakers.OnePlus 7 Pro has massive bug ghost touch. i cud repro on 2 of my phones. Enable nfc and run cpu-z app, touch on the menu. #OnePlus7Pro #OnePlus #bugg\\n\\n \\n\\n  I bought this mobile launch after 1 day and today i write review b\"coz i have no any problem, this is very best mobile in the market andSuperb Quality üëçüèª OnePlus üòòFlagship Killer üå†Designed and look üòçüòòDisplay is very smooth...üòçCamera is good üëçüèªGaming experience is best üëçüèªBattery is Good 1 hour Full Charge (4000 mAh) its good fast Charger. and little bit fast drain b\"coz 90hz display but wrap charger its handle this issue, no problem.No any issue in this mobile üëçüèªOverall Top class mobile üòçI used Apple üëéüèª or Samsung üëéüèªbut this mobile Awesome üòçüòçüòçGo For It üíØüíØüíØ\\n\\n \\n\\n  Actually I\\'m really disappointed from product (One Plus 7 pro).I\\'m facing problem for the first day.Now I\\'m thinking I should buy it offline.I made a huge mistake to buy it from you.this is for all customers viewing my review\"Please don\\'t buy any expensive thing from this website.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n  I like the phones but mostly dislike missing 3.5mm jack battery drain very fast. And in the box only normal  case cover is there and no protection on display screen it\\'s just coated with plastic strips. Atleast provide screen guard glass in the box.. and the main thing is that no screen guard available in the market.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Phone is utter waste and not worth buing this flgship phone ......phone gets heated while normal useage and while playing games the phone feels like something hot substance and it shows the message like phone is heating and temperature is increasing please switch off the phone until Cool down and battery goes like just water ....not worth for 4000mah battery doesn\\'t work it just gives 4 hours backup and I need to charge again and again ......it has lagging issues they said which they will be fixing in coming updates but there is no updates regarding that mid range phones are far better than this OnePlus 7 pro regretted buying this phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  As expected, OP7Pro is best phone i ever used.. very smooth. Finishing looks great with curvy structure. and i have no words for its performance,really it is behond expectafion.But still one problem, OP didn\\'t provided typeC to 3.5mm converter in the box. You have to spent some 400 extra to purchace that or you have to go for bullets 2.0.. but this phone is great.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Great product.Snappy and superfast as u will expect from a Oneplus phone.Packed with the powerful Snapdragon 855 processor.Camera also excellent especially after update.Battery life surprisingly good and that Warp Charge is ultra fast.Display is best that any smartphone can get with 1440p Oled display and refresh rate of 90 Hz which sets it apart from competition.Gaming is the best experience with this display and powerful processor. Can play PUBG on HDR and Extreme graphics without any sort of lag. Too smooth.In display fingerprint scanner is the fastest I\\'ve ever seen.10 layer cooling tech works like wonders. Its nearly impossible to get this phone too hot. Even after long periods of gaming it stays cool.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am writing this review after 9.5.10 update & after using it for more than 1 month.Pros:1.Display (though brightness could have been better) - My friends are just awestrucked by the quality of display OnePlus has put in. They say \"ufff!! Display ta dekh just, chokchok kor6e\" (Look at the display, it\\'s shining), \"Side theke dekh, sera, sera, kato daam re phone tar, amio kinbo\" (look at from the sides, awesome, awesome, how much does this phone cost,I will also buy it).2.Battery life - 1 day battery backup for heavy users. If used in dark mode and 30-40% brightness in auto switch & 90hz mode you may get upto 1.5 days battery life. But even if the battery get drained warp charge will charge it in an hour.3. Vibration - Best among most of the android phones out there but only bettered by iphone.4. Performance - Best performer till date. Oneplus\\'s software is the benchmark for the mobile industry. Take a bow oneplus.5. Sound Quality -  Loud & Crisp. Though a little more depth would have been appreciated.CONS1. Camera - Camera is a mixed bag. It takes inconsistent photos. But yesterday I received 9.5.10 update which corrected the over warm tone of the photos. People don\\'t look too pinkish & focusing is also improved. Wide angle lens can\\'t be used in videos as of now but oneplus is working on an update & will introduce this feature surely. Selfies are ok. In comparison to pixel & iphone & samsung\\'s flagship phones this camera may be inferior,but I have to say oneplus is able to improve the camera performance of this mobile through multiple updates. Now I am satisfied with the camera performance of this beast. Camera isn\\'t a deal breaker anymore.2. Lack of headphone jack - Even the type c to 3.5mm headphone is not included within the box & after 2 months of this phone\\'s launch oneplus is still not able to make it available to purchase from online or offline stores. Shame on you oneplus. You couldn\\'t give an adapter worth ‚Çπ390 (manufacturing cost is ‚Çπ40) in the box of a ‚Çπ50k rupees phone. This is my biggest gripe using this phone. But it\\'s a fault of OnePlus not the phone.Edit : Today I bought oneplus\\'s official audio adapter from their website for ‚Çπ439 (including shipping fee).3. No IP rating & wireless charging - though I don\\'t need them.4. Customer Support - No where near the quality of this phone. Few service centres are available. Most of the accessories are out of stock. I am very disappointed with the service of oneplus.5. Tempered glass - No official tempered glass launched by oneplus for op 7 pro whereas it\\'s available for the regular 7. I purchased an uv glue glass from a local shop worth ‚Çπ600 & the glues are spreading from the sides of the phone. Oneplus should have released their official tempered glass for their best phone.6. Price - I read from the internet that the manufacturing cost of this phone is ‚Çπ22k. But you are charging more than  double the manufacturing cost. This phone should have been priced at ‚Çπ40k,though it\\'s cheaper than samsung and apple\\'s flagships.ConclusionMost of the cons I mentioned are related to the support of oneplus not of this phone. Hence,I would suggest everyone who is looking to buy a real flagship, take this one & you won\\'t regret.Final rating9.5/10\\n\\n \\n\\n  Best phone ever, the only problem is sometimes while selecting photos using watsapp, it\\'s getting stuck. I checked with one of my friends as well, he too had the same issue. Hopefully this will resolve in future patchings\\n\\n \\n\\n  Honestly i love iphone and from the reviews and ratings of this product considered me to buy this phone but my previous phone iPhone 7 was too good and i was not too happy with my new android so i gave this oneplus to my sister and bought iPhone 11 and im very happy with my decision.For me no phone is better than apple iPhone i mean iphones are the leader of phone industry and for this oneplus I don‚Äôt like this phone too much i mean its good for those who likes to live with android.\\n\\n \\n\\n  First of all I regret buying a Chinese mobile phone and I urge all my Indian brother and sister to stop buying any Chinese mobile or any article to extent possible.  By buying Chinese product we are funding Chinese army to get more stock of ammunition and attack India.For God sake, don\\'t buy Chinese product\\n\\n \\n\\n  one plus 7 pro the best phone i have ever fluid amoled is awsm finger print 0.26 un lock super speed super performnce ultimate gaming experince cam super I MOSLTY LIKE THE NOTIFICATION BARS COMING IN BLUE LIGHT ON EITHER SIDES IS ULTIMATE wrap charge is also excellent 5 stars\\n\\n \\n\\n  Tremendous Excellent mobile phone by One +All the features is amazing üòçüòçüòçüòçCamera Quality is amazing especially Pop up camera looks üòé cool.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been using this phone for more than a month now and here is my short review-Camera- Camera is extremely good until you bring s10 or iphone11 into competition....other than that it easily beats other phones falling below 50k lineSoftware and Speed- NO MATCH.....This is THE most fluid and comfortable experience i had using a phone ever....i dont think any phone can match this level of smoothnessBattery- Sort of Average i would say but Warp Charging is Extremely Fast and hence it makes the overall experience goodDisplay- NO MATCH....No Bezels, No Notch, No Punch-hole....Just Pure Screen....That Curved 2k 90hz display is the best screen i have ever used and even better than my friend\\'s Note 10 PlusAudio- Dual Stereo Speakers Is Super loud and Crisp and gives a very enhanced music experienceBut i regret buying the oneplus bullets 2 as it sounds like budget bluetooth earphonesI also have attached some pictures...i would recommened to buy Nebula Blue as it looks different from the crowdThanks for reading\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have migrated from apple. Not regreting. Being launched on May19, Not feeling outdated, even after next gen onplus phones are out. Still getting good battery life out of it, without any compromise in preformance. Camera quality is ok, but not the best. You can get good images, if you tweek some settings while in pro cam. Excelent choice for the price range.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Amazingly quick phone, was under some doubts when i read the reviews which were negative about this phone while the overall rating was better then 4 star! All doubts cleared though as i have been using it since last week.I have cut one star because i believe it can improve further on camera and fingerprint sensitivity as well as few tweaks in software (like u cant seperately lower down notification volume); otherwise, it is a phone to have in 50k range!\\n\\n \\n\\n  Mobile has good battery, excellent sound quality,but oneplus accessories (original) not available in open market, I\\'ve searched for screen glass , but in oneplus official store also not available till now for one plus 7 pro, worst maintenance for oneplus and one complaint is unnecessary movement of popup cam during mobile in pocket while sitting and standing.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am diehard fan of one plus but this time I was disappointed coz of its camera quality even..one plus 5 has better camera quality than it..  pop selfi camera is also not good ..the picture are blurred after captured...it\\'s battery is not good as previous phones coz it\\'s drained fastly...nd also disappointed for headphones jacks...or even in the time of unboxing u shown there are Bluetooth headset but I didn\\'t get any headset..u should provide headset with phone when we paid 50 k...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Demerits Very heavy it weighs like a powerbank.Low light camera is not up to the mark compared to oppo f11.Wide angle videos not supported.No headphone jack nor a connector in box which is very bad.Pricing toooooo much.MeritsWarp charging is superbBattery backup is also good but not up to the mark.Front camera is unimaginably good.Gestures and performance are excellent.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Adaptable usage, captivating screen presence, amiable towards eyes, diligent software, and a phenomenal experience using this phone. Heck, I\\'m even reading e-books( never read a book before btw) online, that\\'s how fun the screen refresh rate is helping me with. Yes camera needs some work, but hey they did a good job.The only set back(in a way) is, I was dreading to get almond(8gb,256), and settled for grey(6 GB, 128).. because almond is not available in 6gb and when i checked my ram usage recently, i was only using 4.5gb of 6gb with 62 apps. 8gb would be an over kill, so not really a set back.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Have been an ardent fan of OnePlus ever since I bought my OnePlus 3. This is my 2nd product from them and have always recommended in my circle to buy their phones for the performance, value for money, and the simplicity it brings in their phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is the worst product i have ever got from Amazon.i bought this on 27jan  nw display is not working nd if some one call me display stops working i called to ur executive on 6th of this month he said to format the mobile i did as he said mobile worked well for one day nd again same prblm arose nw wat i have to do nw i want u guys to help me out of this .\\n\\n \\n\\n  Mobile is excellent and display is superb... I can\\'t find much difference between 90Hz and 60Hz refresh rate.. battery is draining Very fast ..one plus must work on it.pop up camera is awesome..for face unlock it unlocks with in a blink even we cant find the camera moving up and going inside..back camera OnePlus claims 48 MP , but images taken are same as one plus 6t cam . which is 20mp...finally one can go for one plus 7 Pro if they are affordable for 50k bucks , one who wants to enjoy popup camera..display is really super .\\n\\n \\n\\n  One of the best looking smartphones out there. The display looks amazing, it is super smooth. The fingerprint scanner is also fast and better compared to 6T and other phones having indisplay fingerprint scanner. The camera have been improved a lot from past models(I used to have OnePlus 5T and also used OnePlus 6T for sometime). The battery backup is fine if you are using 60hz and 1080p resolution it would easily last a whole day even after gaming for 1.5-2hrs and with heavy usage of other apps. Speakers are also good they are quite loud enough. Charging speed is also good ..it charges from 0-100% in approx 1hr 16min average.Overall really good device. The constant updates makes it even better. Smooth and bloatware free OS.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0Phone with I have been waiting for since one year , oneplus 7 pro is my first smartphone from oneplus. I need to tell few people, who has put down few wrong reviews including the box coming with two covers and headphones by just watching the reviewer box in YouTube guys please grow up and understand the reviewers box and the box which we get in outlet it is totally different please understand and don\\'t waste your comment and miss guide people.Likings1. Best display out there.(may be less brighter than the Samsung Galaxy display)2. And wonderful stereo speakers3. Good battery life4. You feel excited to use the phone everyday due to the display.5. The phone might be heavy but dam it\\'s good its feel really good in hand6. Snappiness of a smartphone is incomparable to any other smartphone out there especially Samsung.Dislikes1. I know one plus has always been struggling in the camera it still does but improved alot when compared to the older version of oneplus smartphones.2. Might be too large for the people with smaller hands and smaller brains3. Difficulties to get screen protectorsYou will be extremely happy use the phone everyday a and and I think OK it is worth every penny which you are spending to this smartphone.Go for it guys by the way hey I am using 8 GB RAM variant of oneplus with nebula blue colour.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It is a good phone except that now since One Plus 7T and 7T Pro are here. They are a better option. And the 7T is cheaper as well.Apart from that, you can also get 2000 more off if you used my referral. In case you need a referral, you can mail me at danschmidt4321@gmail.com or 9711382150 whatsappThe phone\\'s 90Hz display is the main thing about it. But only for gaming would you see a stark difference and realise how good it is. If you don\\'t intend on doing that, then no point buying a 90Hz display.Great audio quality. Camera is amazing! The nightscape mode is great as well.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Some time Touch sensor doesn\\'t response so advice me what to do after 11 day of purchase m facing problem .camera quality is not up to Mark standard ,don\\'t know problem is my phone or it\\'s a OnePlus quality standard.immidiate after purchase I request to give me seller contact details but not provided to me , Don\\'t know why .RegardsPunit\\n\\n \\n\\n  Display - 5/5Performance - 4.5/5Charging - 5/5User Interface - 4/5Sound - 4/5Camera - 4/5Fingerprint reader - 3.5/5Weight - 2/5Pop up selfie camera - 4.5/5Feel - 4.5/5Value for money - 4/5\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am using this phone from past one month and trust me guys, one of the best phone in the market right now. Battery life is far better than my previous samsung flagship phones. Camera is good but the main thing is display. Best display in market right now. Amazing sound quality. No comparison in terms of performance and charging is amazingly fast. Only drawback is regarding the notifications i.e. there is no AOD and notification LED so you have to wake up the phone each time to check whether you have received notification or not.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Excellent phone ! LovedFan of OnePlus mobiles , quality is amazing , Glossy finish makes it look more beautifulBattery performance = 5 starDispay : 5 starSpeed : 4 starCamera : 4 starOs : 5 star\\n\\n \\n\\n  Oneplus 7 pro is a gorgeous device, looks great, feels great while in hand. Glass back with matte finish combined with curved glass adds a touch of premiumness to the phone. I have done some nitpicking although after thorough use of the device for 4 days.1. Fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow sometimes. I have heard that it keeps on improving as days pass by. But it is annoying sometimes.2. SOT is somewhat between 5-6 hours with normal usage,  it would have been good to have around 4500mah battery capacity.3. Sensors does not work smoothly every time, auto brightness is aweful, fingerprint unlock misses one out of five times and pick up your phone to show has low response.4. Phone is heavy, would require time to get adjusted.5. Photo quality is great at daylights, but at night the corners get washed out a bit.6. Horizon light feature is just laughable, it happens only for a single time once a notification pops up and not at a certain interval.7. No 3.5mm headphone jack.None of the google, samsung, apple or huwaei provides latest flagship below 50k price range, so if you can live with the cons mentioned above, then happily buy this device.One more point, got the android 10 update on the same day I received the device from amazon. Thumbs up for oneplus support.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Have being using it since last 2 days .. Didn\\'t find any feature which is new or unique to 1+7 series. In fact there r lots of good features in my last mobile Honor 8X which I found missing in this.Big disappointment is1) Fast battery discharge. Full charge lasted for 21 hrs only.2) Dual sim reduced functionality.3) Android 9.04) Settings very complex\\n\\n \\n\\n  Good and speedier product, suitable for business as well as personal use. MS Office works very fine. Curved screen gives extra large viewing. Easy to hold. Original karboon back cover adds to its business-look.Battery easily lasts three days at moderate use. Very helpful.Did not use camera or finger-print reader till now.Overall a prized possession who has been using BlackBerry for over 10 years and, after its discontinuance, was looking for equally good product.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I am a huge fan of one plus mobiles , for the 1st time I have bought one plus 7pro , all features are excellent but only three problems are bothering me1st one : though I kept the fingerprint reader security for phone  it doesn\\'t working properly and phone lock  is opening  up like a normal like named swipe up2nd one : sometimes fingerprint scanner tooks more time to unlock the phone3rd one : battery life is not greater , when compared to Samsung j7 series  it doesn\\'t gives 60%of battery life of j7Please work on it and update me how to solve my problemsI never want to change my brand from one plus , and if the problem continues how can I be tied up with you\\n\\n \\n\\n  Battery drain problem and hanging problem in this one plus 7 pro 12gb ram.very worst phone of one plus in one series and cost is too much high and it doesn\\'t deserve this cost.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Waste of money only speed,  Changing speed also not good same like oneplus 6 ,fingerprint is less secured open using some tricks, camera is too poor for money\\n\\n \\n\\n  2 months on and the experience has been great so far. Whether it\\'s about taking pictures or watching that high-res video song is just a matter of pure indulgence. Totally in love with the 90 Hz Display that gives videos and live wallpapers an extra fluid factor. Camera quality is superb and the overall processor response is like overwhelmingly good. Initially there were some lags with opening of the camera those are not present now after the updates. Kudos to the OnePlus Team for giving a nice finish to the exterior look and overall aesthetics of the Phone. True Notch-less Experience that is worth owning.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Overall average product for the price i paid. The disaster is internet speed is superrrrrrrr slow in this.  i was using oneplus3 previously and switched to this model now and now I can\\'t use internet at all. Beware before buying this product.\\n\\n \\n\\n  its a great phone in this price segment.  best display, premiums looks and built quality, the fastest phone, smoother experience, best choice for heavy gamers and for the best graphics..the only con is average berry life.. if you are a heavy user..u will have to charge twice in 24 hours..but quick Dash charge is super fast.. so if twice charging in a single day is ok then go for it..face unlock is but slower as popup camera takes time to get opened. overall its the best flagship smart phone if your budget is around 40-50k..\\n\\n \\n\\n  Super awesome product in such a cheaper price. It\\'s my first time using android phone and have to say that one plus delivers a very premium quality in such a low price. I would everytime recommend this product to those who are thinking to buy apple or samsung smartphone, just give this phone a try it will never disappoint you. The fingerprint scanner, camera, gaming experience, movie watching experience are some of the things has always been at the top notch for me.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I had an option of getting the S10+ or the OP 7 Pro. Glad I went for the latter. Firstly, I do not spend big bucks on a phone for camera. I base my purchases on a phone for the performance and the speed.  Even though the camera is not as good as S10+  the OP 7 Pro makes up for it by having notchless display and 90 Hz. When people say there\\'s hardly any difference  between 60 Hz and 90 Hz it is not true.  I also went for 12 Gb option so this helps battery draining apps to run in the background. Only issue is the battery does not meet my expectations and the whole charge barely lasts 18 hours.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Worst product because at this price this is not water proof and they claim it as water resistant but that is not true as my phone screen got completely damaged in minor rain. Don‚Äôt buy this at this price.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Everything is superb ....minor changes needed....battery life could be better but good as compared to the display size and quality.....the dispaly and camera are the best one....Get a major issue with the device.....its get swtich off as i connect it to charging......one month review.....i really hate one plus now.....first one plus device may be the last one tooo.....\\n\\n \\n\\n  Product is as per description. Screen guard had bubble. Camera quality is good.Battery when charged 100% will run full day. Speed is good.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Firstly, a great phone, all the features which it has right from the notchless display to the 90Hz refresh rate coupled with the space and the UFS 3.0 transmission, this device works buttery smoothWith the android 10 update now availale, the phone has only improved system and UI experience wise with dark mode and the addition of digital well-being.Though a bit overpriced than Redmi K20 pro, i feel if you really want a great UI experience with the Oxygen OS and dont mind spending a little more for a phone, this phone will serve you atleast 3-4 years making it value for money\\n\\n \\n\\n  Let me begin by saying that the display is just amazing. Everything is buttery smooth and fast. Coming to the fingerprint scanner it could be better because sometimes it takes time to read. Face id is fast, although i have nothing else to compare it with but still good. And camera to be honest is actually good and night mode is little bit sumdgy somtimes but still captures good night pictures. Video recording is the best i gotta say, it is very stable. The only problem i found about the video is the 4k 60 fps mode, the file size is so large it is actually impossible to record more than 10 mins which would probably take about 10gb of memory. The front camera is also pretty decent. Coming to the os its one of the best i have used and all the apps function very very smoothly. If you are planning to go for iphone in the same range i would recommend to go for oneplus 7 pro since its a much better buy.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is one heck of a phone.What\\'s Good:Awesome DisplayAwesome CameraAwesome warp ChargingI was a iphone user and recently decided to give OnePlus a Shot.It won\\'t let you down, Got for it.One to One, I\\'ll say its even better than Iphone. Plus you got so much user control when you use android, everything is so restricted in iphone.Loved this Phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  One Plus Genuinely Could have worked on the camera picture quality . It\\'s Just mediocre. The Phone is a beast when it comes to Gaming and it doesn\\'t heat up. Battery life is Good considering it\\'s a performance based fone. Overall not satisfied with the pricing but happy with the performance\\n\\n \\n\\n  The best thing about this phone is the screen and battery life. Hands down the phone lasts for a full day with heavy screen on time and could last a day n half or even two with little usage. However, the camera is a big disappointment for me who is coming from Google pixel phone. Also, for the features and quality of this phone, I believe it could have been priced between 35-40k and not more.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome handset so far. I have not faced any issue. The only thing I have to mention is the connectors missing from the box. C-Type to 3.5mm should have been given in box along with hands free. Anyways that is what I think may be most of them dont think that way.\\n\\n \\n\\n  1. My new One Plus 7 Pro delivered yesterday. But could not be able to set up as Android closes frequently. Tried several times after switch off/on. (Photo of error message enclosed)Contacted Amazon technical team, but response unsatisfactory.  Replacement ordered yesterday evening itself. No response till now.2.  My earlier One Plus 6, after software  updating to ver. 10 , the BSNL 3G/4G sim is working for call and SMS only, but no data service. Went to BSNL and checked. Sim works with other mobile , but not with my OP 6(after updating). APN setting show blank. They says problem with mobile/software.Any solutions?\\n\\n \\n\\n  I upgraded it from One plus 6. It\\'s just a perfect phone in all aspects. Every spec including hardware and software is awesome. Display,design,camera , sound everything meet my expectations.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Everything ok excellent feel , finger print sensor not at good as per this phone standard... doesn\\'t work properly. Again and its show mismatch. Getting irritated. With this high cost, their is No head set , no c type connecter to 3.5 audio Jack. The packaging is very very worst.. no bubble wrap , outside box got damage. Really disappointed\\n\\n \\n\\n  Best phone. Everything is good. There is no place to say bad. I love it. I use 17day running..\\n\\n \\n\\n  Received the product today. Absolutely mind blowing. Battery back up, display, camera etc everything is perfect. If budget is not a concern then can go for it. Thanks to Amazon for an perfect delivery.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality is not that good , fingerprint reader doesn\\'t work properly\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone comes with lots of exciting features. Will update about pros qnd cons after 1 month.The beauty about the phone is it\\'s screen and camera. The photo was clicked on portrait mode.Please note, the box doesn\\'t contains usb type c to 3.5 mm headphone adapter.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Product sturdy, neat, premium finishWorth the valueSpeed blinding fast won\\'t feel the lagDisplay is next level with 90hz refresh rate colours are very vibrantVibration feedback powerfulSound loud enough for a roomProcessing power no lag no matter how many apps running in background\\n\\n \\n\\n  Speed and 90 Hz UHD Display is all about this phone. One you use 90 Hz buttery smooth display, it is almost impossible to go backward in 60 Hz. Camara Quality is as usual pretty normal in all one plus phone. It will not justify the price tag. Portrait mode is worst. Only good thing in Camara is Night Mode. Performance and Display are outstanding. Haptic feedback and Dual Sterio Speaker also good.UFS 3.0 Fast storage is also USP for this phone as no other phone have. Not for a Camara beast. Good who is looking for 90Hz smooth display and fast performance.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Most amazing phone I have ever used ..got hands on this yesterday...the smooth touch and the mirror screen is awesome..I would recommend to buy this ...OnePlus is doing a really great job ..hats off to the phone and technology ..worth the price..\\n\\n \\n\\n  What an amazing premium phone, the colour, the build quality, the big curve screen, the speed, battery everything is perfect. I am a oneplus fan. I have been using oneplus 2, oneplus 3 and now directly jumped into 7pro and the oneplus 3 is still running smoothly. Its undoubtedly the flagship killer at this price.\\n\\n \\n\\n  No doubt at present it\\'s the best phone available in the world. At first I thought it\\'s a bit costly but after using it for a month take my word it\\'s worth every penny.I will not mention the features as we all know it, but it\\'s really super fast, the touch is excellent, display has no match and it is super smooth, battery can easily last for full day even with heavy use and the wrap charger fulls it very quickly. Finger print reader has no match, it has great camera with some great features, very good quality even in low light. Friends Oneplus 7pro really is a great Masterpiece by Oneplus.Those making mind to buy but are a little doubtful........ take my word, buy it with closed eyes, you will Love it. Thanks Amazon for 2 day delivery.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Am cutting one star for not having any headphone jack also the OnePlus wireless earphones are too high.Regarding other performance so far so good you can go for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Like:1. Superb screen. It\\'s incredible. Maybe the best that I have seen on a mobile device.2. Great battery life and charging speeds for such a power house.Dislike:1. The camera is really really bad for the hype they created.2. Can\\'t stress enough, camera is sub-par. Especially when you take pictures from third party apps in low light.\\n\\n \\n\\n  OnePlus forgot it\\'s customer first policy, also quality of OnePlus 7 and onwards series are not upto the mark.Their is no premium quality left and the brand is now into mass production of low grade device and supplying in India.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Simply the best deal in the Android world right now. Stupendously quick and delightful performance! Forget all the reviews saying average battery life, I get 7 hours with 90 hz, qhd+, wifi and location on all the time.Love the nebula blue gradient. And the screen, o my god! What a treat.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I don\\'t know why I\\'m seeing so many negative reviews, personally, I haven\\'t seen any issues so far from past 1 week of usage.The camera is not up to the mark but I hope future updates will solve this. Every product has its pros and cons.Hope one plus solves the issues related to the camera.\\n\\n \\n\\n  hi ,Pros:Displaycons:Less battery life , can\\'t take fast pics coz three cameras but good picsBit heavy phonehmmm immersive display so pro of display will rule off restSo don\\'t think much i have thought too much  for 4 months and bought finally but it\\'s worth it guysAs compared with samsung s6 and this is better\\n\\n \\n\\n  just not able to finish the setup process and its heating like crazy.Didnt expect this from OnePlus7 Pro, its highly frustrating\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have been a loyal customer of One Plus.... but the problem I am facing with this phone is that there is no option for cellular/data back up of photos in the backup &Sync section. It only says waiting for wifi. I am clueless what to do about it. This option was clearly available in my previous One Plus phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is awesome after around two updates the camera quality goes better and the fingerprint reader is accurate and fast.Display is awesome and crisp colours are observed. Battery life at first will be somewhat less but as phone adjusts to the usage, the battery life will go up.\\n\\n \\n\\n  A great device with great specs.The display is simply great and now I don\\'t feel like using any other device after using this display.Oxygen OS is fantastic.Warp Charge is very Handy.The camera is also great, although a bit confusing in some aspects.Now runs on Android 10.I couldn\\'t ask for anything more.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Every thing is good with this machine, it works too fast ... That is unbelievably quick ..... Moving to camera  it is not top notch but you can get good pictures with it ...other than that it is an awesome phone I am experiencing for th 4 th month and to this day it hasn\\'t disappointed me . Kudos to you ..., It\\'s edge screen is an eye catching feature that people will admire.Ps: I was using galaxy grand duos and switched to this just this year and everything in it is worth the money\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first one plus device and I am quite impressed with the quality of the phone, however I faced an issue where the camera app kept crashing for which I rebotted the device and the issue got solved. I hope that is just a temporary glitch. The portrait mode works only in telephoto mode and is quite annoying for indoor photography. Hope we get a software update for this. battery charging is very fast and last for a day very comfortably.\\n\\n \\n\\n  No water resistant, but product pdf says water resistant to some extent by this they making us tempt to buy. But finaly dening warranty for water issues.Don\\' t buy this, oneplus and amazon won\\'t help, all of them simply cheating customers.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Don\\'t go by the media uplift of the product. It\\'s not worth the money. Still need a lot of software updation, new issues are arising as one is getting solved. Camera is not so great as they say. But looks good & feels good too so if you don\\'t care about small issues then go for it who am I to stop you?\\n\\n \\n\\n  Well it\\'s one of the best phones out there period.Now it\\'s a great time to buy this phone and it\\'s a good choice too cuz it\\'s prize has gone down a lot. I had a phone to exchange it with so I got it for around 35k which was a steal.of a deal for me. And at that price man this phone is good.\\n\\n \\n\\n  One of the best phone in the market currently.I got this 8 GB RAM+256GB @Rs 39000 during decent sale period which includes 2k HDFC instant discount+ 1.7k HDFC loyalty cashback+6k One plus 5th year anniversary discount.So for me it was a gorgeous deal.Everything seems to be great apart from battery which was a tad disappointing but then u have got a 30W super quick charger.\\n\\n \\n\\n  buy for display ! even though the camera not great compare to iPhone/s10+ but it was pretty good to take photos, Dolby was awesome!  It feels bit heavy but it\\'s manageable! super-bright vivid AMOLED display! speed and haptic vibration is good to feel ! blindly go for it !\\n\\n \\n\\n  Beautiful Phone...Pros -LooksCamera.. especially the pop selfie cameraSpeedLovely Color Gradient of the body...ConsBattery Life - Could have been better..Cannot make folders in the drawer.. as other phones.. should add in OxygenOS\\n\\n \\n\\n  Worst everI dreamt of this phone since 2yrs n finally purchasedDouble tap doesn‚Äôt workBattery drains so muchNo vibrationsSoftware issuesVery much disappointedFinally returned this within a week nFor the same cost I purchased iPhone XRI‚Äôm happy with iPhone now\\n\\n \\n\\n  Battery life is very bad.....warp charger provided in the box isn\\'t as good as company claimed...... company claimed it will reach 0-48 within 20mins but when i tested it was 35% in 20 mins.....but completely charge in 1 hr 15 mins......otherwise everything is good..... Amazon\\'s security service is very good....with this otp system no delivery boy can keep anyone\\'s order or deliver to other person & mark it delivered.......for this security service 5* to amazon\\n\\n \\n\\n  Well purchased it after lot of thinking but i can proudly say one of the best flagship under the price range . Overall from its display to its hardware all upto it\\'s software are tuned up so greatly. And the android 10 with oxygen os 10 after the update works so well . Camera is a big improvement works well in low light conditions and can generate some great shots . Completely satisfied with the one plus 7 pro and it really lets you NEVER SETTLE.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The product is phenomenal....It just blew my mindI definitely recommend you to go for this product.I think it\\'s better to go for this product than Apple iPhone XR , cause it has only 64GB rom.Pros:1) Speed2) Display with no notch3) Classy look4) 90Hz refresh rate makes it buttery smooth5) UFS 3.06) Warp charge7) Stereo speakersCons:1) The phone is slippery without case2) The pre-installed scrath guard is not of a good quality..I would recommend to change it soonThere\\'s not much of a con in this amazing device\\n\\n \\n\\n  Received the product in a day, thanks to amazon, the phone is working super smoothly, great gaming experience, it\\'ll be too early to decide about the battery life, camera quality is good but i feel pictures are slightly artificial kind anyway it\\'s still a flagship killer, processor is super fast.. Nebula blue is an eye candy\\n\\n \\n\\n  Fabulous product... Screen is amazing.... Worth buying... I bought this product for presentation of photography captured in dslr.... So big screen is necessary for me... And i am happy for the pro version...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Everything thing is good, but sometimes it hang while charging.One thing I notice after 2 month on back side of phone glass I observed some minor scratches even I always use back cover.they should improve quality of back glass.It\\'ll become Heavy if you use back cover and glass.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Woderful phone, love many things,...charge within 1hr. Wt- slightly heavy..got use to it.Front camera not so good. All other things are very good. Price is high..fingerprint reader is ok...camera quality is also improved after new update. But camera quality is avarage when u click photo of news paper. U can\\'t read the words. Autorotate is wrost.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very bad expreinced from amazon,defective mobile was sent to me,when i was opened i feel its like used mobile,there are more than 2 bubble are on pre aplied protector ,battry drained in just 15 mnt of starting and android setup time.after long discussion with customer care defective item replace with new one.pls dont buy costly product from amazon.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Hi, I bought this 10 days ago, one plus 7 pro has wonderful fingerprint reader, especially camera quality is excellent ( pop up front camera is very fast ) , battery life is very good and last one ICICI instant discount of 2000... Overall wonderful\\n\\n \\n\\n  Overall phone performance is good. Camera is very nice. Fingerprint sensor is thunder fast. Display is mind blowing.this device gives u a better experience. U\\'ll never ever seen before. I\\'m very happy for this product. My favorite colour is blue üíô. Nebulla blue is the only colour which gives u a royal look. Battery life is better. Charging is like warp charge For every 1 min 3% will charge. That\\'s the beauty of this phoneüòç. Loved itüòò. Expecially camera has 10x zoom. Gives a clear output to which you have focused. Jai Saaho üòé. #Saahotimes_birthday_vibes_oneplus7proüòç\\n\\n \\n\\n  Hi,Pls confirm whether purchase from Amazon automatically entitles me for warranty or not. If not, kindly guide how to cover the oneplus 7 pro 12gb Ram 256GB Storage can be covered in the warranty.Also i had taken a number of gift cards/booking card for oneplus pro phone. however i could not place order till 15th june as 12GB RAM product was hardly available for booking. Pls confirm that my purchase is covered under screen protection.RgdsMunindra\\n\\n \\n\\n  Best Android phone you will ever need.I have been using this for 4 months and it works as smooth as butter. I have the 12gb RAM with 256gb memory variant. Has zero glitches while running CPU intensive apps. The selfie camera mechanism is quite sturdy and safe. All in all, whatever OnePlus claims for this phone is true. The only con is that it doesn\\'t come with a type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter/ converter.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Its a beast interms of performance. Oxygen OS is as smooth as always and its get better and better day by day. Updates are always on time. Interms of camera it\\'s good but not the best as compared to the competition. Still waiting for the updated camera software which was promised by the OnePlus team during the launch of this phone. Battery life is better than average but not so good for heavy users.\\n\\n \\n\\n  If you are android user and you want something fast in your life than go for it best device in terms of everything\\n\\n \\n\\n  Support is pathetic, they don\\'t even to bother to respond to emails or phone calls.It is like u buy the phone and forget you will get any service from them.Phone has issues after using a while which can be fixed by support but they do not provide any help\\n\\n \\n\\n  Beware, the back glass will cracks itself within 2-3months on its own even using the proper case. Check yourself the one plus support community thread , numerous cases are listed with same problem with same pattern . One plus plus just another mediocre quality smartphone company\\n\\n \\n\\n  Mobile are too good\\n\\n \\n\\n  The phone is little heavier than previous OnePlus models, I understand 4000 battery and big screen. Otherwise it deliverd as promised. Initially it fails 2-3 time during initial setup due to software glitch but hard-reboot helped to restore the error. The mobile is a charm.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The only thing I resent about this phone is the exclusion of the headphone adapter/dongle in the box. Oh and the cheap quality tpu case that comes with it. Dick move OnePlus!Phone is great however, though for the asking price of 58K it better be.\\n\\n \\n\\n  A good device. Review after 3 months. The best part is it\\'s display. Finger print reader and face recognition are in the higher level. Camera is ok but not awesome. Battery is also up to the satisfactory level. Recommended to purchase in place of Apple devices if want to enjoy the Android platform. You can get more details in YouTube. 5 out of 5 stars.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This mobile phone is awesome in this series. After using for 1 month I realise that this phone is the best amongst other flagship mobile phones. Camera filters needs to be reviewed by OnePlus . No network issues at all. 90 hz display is wonderful. Overall excellent product\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was sceptical before ordering almond colour but it looks amazing in person. Pictures on Amazon do zero justice to actual look of the phone. I am so glad I got this one. Needless to talk about features because it is OnePlus after all.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I absolutely liked the mobile. There is no ifs and buts. Looks are super. Feel is even more super. Charging speed is excellent. Usage is very easy. Finger scan is good. Highly recommended in the high end mobile category. Must buy.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Overall the phone is awesome camera ,batter, lookwise, soundquality without earphones, popup camera tottaly best phone Only one thing i dnt like that oneplus should provide c to 3.5  converter for  earphones  must...have a 100% look on this... And if they  then plz send me 1 pair... Eles tge the phone is best\\n\\n \\n\\n  If you think you can live without headphone jack, think again. Get Bluetooth headphones and it\\'s the best phone in the world.Battery / charging speedScreen (dimensions and resolution)PerformanceAudio (speaker)GamingEverything is top notch.Camera is also okay... You won\\'t be able to tell the difference. Pop up camera works fine.The case provided by OnePlus sucks... So get that also.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The basics tenants of smartphone design weren\\'t radically challenged the previous year.But 2019 ,brought a few exceptional releases.And this is the phone I am talking about....Saying this an expensive is a contradiction.In today\\'s days of industrialization and globalization, both life and time is synonymous. And running with this phone is much easier as compared to today\\'s world.Not only it has best features but has an awesome look. Finally, this phone is incredible...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Gud one  ..I bought this phone last week..and all bad rumors are wrong about it...This is an amazing phone in everything ..specially in games it it so smooth , let it be PUBG or any other high graphic games ..and it\\'s battery charging and Curved (looks like 3D) is awesomeüòò ...Also reviews about 1 or 2 star for this smartphone are all from fake bad marketers or morons . Its been almost 8 months since I am using this phone and me and everyone I know Loves it\\n\\n \\n\\n  Switched from iphone to OnePlus. First time using a OnePlus device.Display is beautiful and attractive. . You can feel the 90 hz display on ur fingertips.Overall decent battery life. Lasts for a day. Drains rapidly while watching videos and playing games.Processor is superfast and super snappy. Oxygen os works very well.\\n\\n \\n\\n  PHONE SOO MUCH HEATED USED ONLY SOME TIME BUT ITS SO MUCH HEATEDAND BACK CAMERA IS NOT CLEAREDYOU CAN ALSO SEE THE CAMERA QUALITY IN PHOTO\\n\\n \\n\\n  I have purchased One Plus 7 Pro (Nebula Blue) 12/256 from Amazon. Overall look of the handset is fine but it keeps getting hanged while talking and it\\'s touch sensor is not up to the mark . Overall i am not happy with the handset i received,  i don\\'\\'t know whether store has given an old/used handset to me because other friends of mine are using the same phone but they are not finding this issue as such and they bought it from Chroma.\\n\\n \\n\\n  amazing design and display quality.facelock,fingerprint lock super.performance is terrible.battery is not bad.white balance of the camera is little bad.anyway nice product.i really liked it.OnePlus give me an amazing product.\\n\\n \\n\\n  One plus is a big brand now.over all features of phone is good.but I am really disappointed with one plus not even proving any kind of earphone or earphone jack as well..now a day if I am purchasing a nokia1280 worth rs 1000 also providing earphones & one plus 7 pro Is of 53k bro..highly disappointed\\n\\n \\n\\n  After a couple of months the face unlock and fingerprint stopped working. Although both security is activated yet the phone gets unlocked by just a swipe. All my friends can unlock the phone with face recognition üòÇüòÇ i have tried setting password unlock but still this phone gets unlocked with a swipe. I would have serviced it but seriously, what phone gets damaged within couple of months? Not even half a year has passed and I had to resell it. Definitely not a quality buy.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Really very fluid experience. 90 Hz refresh rate really makes everything look much smoother. The battery life is great. Fingerprint sensor is a bit slow, but the whole screen without any notch and a 90 Hz display combined with very less Bezels makes it the best value for money on the market.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This was the immediate response:Fingerprint sensor could have been better. Battery life is awesome. Display is again a thumbs up. Earphones absence in the box had let me down. But over a good phone, may little over priced I felt.After 11 months usage:Definitely not worth the money. It\\'s only a spec sheet phone. It hangs a lot. I have gone service center almost 5 times. And their services is again not customer centric. Phone still hangs often. It gets heated up like hell. Sometimes I can\\'t hold it, it gets that hot while charging or sometimes when I play games. Really pathetic and strongly against getting this phone!\\n\\n'"
