       " \"\\n\\n  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Dear Amazon & samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.Rear Camera getting blur in low light.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone\\'s quality doesn\\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I\\'m lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is \"dust\" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\\n\\n',\n",

Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund\\n\\n\",\n",

Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.\\n\\n',\n",

The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps.

Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3.

Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4.

Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)\\n\\n\",\n",

Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products\\n\\n\",\n",

I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting\\n\\n',\n",

So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.\\n\\n\",\n",

Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

When you play music, you can see that the volume of the song just fading off and at a point you just cannot hear any noise from the phone.When I try to return the phone its asking to install a smart check app and only if the app says there is some defect, they would take the phone back. If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one.And another point to note is that, I trusted that I would be happy with this phone, hence had purchased a special phone cover. now that money is also a waste.\\n\\n',\n",

The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\\n\\n\",\n",

Phone was charged to 73%.Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Over heating issue and slow charging time 5 hours in full charge over slow .and proper not working in sensor..so pls don't pay ..waste your money\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  II am writing this with 4 months of usage.Issue1: Getting On-Hold automatically during calls.Issue2: Call recording also autmatically ON during calls even we dont need.Issue3: Sensors are very bad, not able to recognize call is going or not.Issue4: Camera stabilization is very bad, not able to take photo of scan docs perfectly, always it used to be blurred.Issue5: Charging time is more, even though they are telling 15w charge. My old phone get charged quickly rather than this.When i tried to reach customer care toll free, there is no response from them saying \"Limited staff\". Think before buying this model twice.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I have noticed below issues with phone.* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.Also battery drains out easily* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!======================================================================================Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after more than a month of usage:- The phone heats up during charging.- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This phone is great with battery backup and picture quality but within 8 days the phone got in bootloop as sson as I got a new update and I did it. This is not even starting now.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Its OS Software got crashed in first update build release and it happened to all the M31 devices\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Hangs up in 2 months. Had to loose entire Data. Samsung service centres is always full with atleast 100 people in line. That speaks about the quality . Had similar experience in the past. Trusted Samsung for second time in vain. Never Buy Samsung Products. within 2 months touch not working and hangs up frequently.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  \\xa0The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.I purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.I have used the camera in the last 5 months. The results are very satisfactory. There may be some limitations in low light photography, but with a little tweaking, you get good results.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am 💯 percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,Display: good,Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,\\n\\n\",\n",

That too 3 to 4 times a day !Intially I thought it needs an update and might work fine after that but that didn't work too.It's not very pleasing when it restarts in the middle of some important work you trying to finish.I have been using this phone for a month now but it has not been working upto my expectations.Sorry but not happy with my purchase.\\n\\n\",\n",

There was a little scratch on the side of the phone, many applications weren’t working properly on the phone (ex: YouTube, Spotify), but eventually YouTube was fine but Spotify still has problem. I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person’s voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn’t show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don’t have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand. It may stop working any time.Poor experience with amazon as well as the Samsung galaxy m31.I don’t even want to keep this phone, It gave me that bad experience in just 2 days of using it. But amazon is not supporting at all.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Most disgusting service from Amazon & Samsung ever. Received a defected Mobile which had issues with its touchscreen. Replacing the phone is such a pain in the wrong place. First they ask you to download a stupid app to run testing which takes incorrect tests. I have problem with my touchscreen & they test the fingerprint sensor & give a result stating that all is good. Secondly I cannot contact any customer care agent as no one is available at this point of time. Customers are left to fend for themselves. \"Atmanirbhar\" is taken to a whole new level by Amazon!!! Utterly DisgustingPlease sort this out Amazon before your customers shift to other online apps.Samsung, Where has your quality gone? Do you only focus on expensive phones? One Plus & other brands have already started eating up your market share.. please act wisely if you don\\'t want to share your fate with Nokia.\\n\\n',\n",

They said they cannot write everything about product.Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.\\n\\n',\n",

The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre-installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re pre-installed, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera ReviewThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.Galaxy M31That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security ReviewGalaxy M31The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance ReviewGalaxy M31The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone10. Night mode photos are stunning. The first photo given above is of Hyderabad nightline, taken from my balcony.11. Next two photos are of clouds taken from an Indigo flight.12. Next snap is of cardamom flowers in my garden.13. The last one is pav baked by me at home. Snap taken with Food Mode. I found in food mode pictures coming alive.I especially impressed with night mode and food .Ode photos. They are si.ply superb.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Phones battery life is good but it gets heated for example when you are on call for a long time for while booking cabs when location is on it takes a lot of battery No pop up notifications in WhatsApp phone needs work in accessibility I am a low vision person the phones keyboard gets too much expanded when using zoom gesture making it impossible to type I have to reboot the whole phone to get the keyboard to its normal size . Select to speak options hangs frequently and the phone becomes unaccessible.after my purchase there was a software update due to which my screen gets zoom automatically creating problem while using which is very irritating face recognition is not that good phone takes two and a half hour to charge completely.Camera is really nice beautiful pictures come out.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Missing app lock and secure folder, I hope software update will fix it in future.Headphone is missing 😩.Downloaded s secure from galaxy store for App lock.Removed unnecessary preloaded apps.Add restrictions for background data if you want to save data and battery.Great Camera tested in all moods(check in pictures).Night mood is superb.Anyone posting bad reviews about camera is personal intentions.Freefire or pubg consums 6% battery per hour. But remember it depends on your network speed.Fast charging is working perfectly,Still moving my apps from old galaxy J7 Pro, I will update my review after 1 month.Nice phone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.\\n\\n\",\n",

About battery I want to say something that please do charge the phone for the first time to 100% fully charge and then use the phone or else the battery life reduces.The camera quality is awesome. Just remember to apply correct settings.Front camera photos looks awesome.Phone performance is also very good. Very smooth controls and the screen quality is also very good.Sound quality is also up to the markThe phone has an excellent sensor coordination for everything.It also has a virtual proximity sensor and an AR support from Google with an excellent gyro sensor.The fingerprint sensor is also very fast.The face unlock feature is above everything.It detects face automatically when your phone is kept upright even without turning screen on. It will detect your face and automatically turn on.The look of the phone is also very nice with a glassy look on back.This is a power packed phone which will always win over any phone in this price range.I think everyone should try this experience.I trust Samsung and still I think it is better to buy a Samsung phone than to buy other phones even if they are offering some more features.I am very happy to write this review.I think this review you make impact a bit.Just stop here and buy this product.After using it you would be feel that your decision was right.Thank you for reading my review till last.\\n\\n',\n",

It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  It is a best budget phone with the amount of provided specs in it, having a massive battery of 6000mah gave me a decent backup of upto 2 days, if you are a average user then this is a phone you want, I played all types of games in it from ludo to asphalt 9 and pubg but it stood up to its name as not much of battery drain but minute lags were observed at the start but later on after few second everything got ok, adaptive brightness is very good but was not working some times had to manually set it but sometimes switching it off and on came as a solution, fingerprint sensor is quick but some times doesn't works if it is a bit dusty, also if you hands are wet it will take multiple attempts before giving access, most of the reviews I read about back panel color and material quality was negative as compared with other phones but personally i liked the color of back panel as I have the ocean blue you can call me old fashioned but there are many reasons like 1. It looks good,  2. Doesn't slips from you hand 3. Eventually you are going to use a back cover with it and etc, I have a transparent back cover over mine coz no other color would be that good as it's original, its display is one of the best as the picture quality and the color contrast and many other aspects cannot be compared with other phones in market, it also provided built in Dolby atmos when using earphone which totally changes the experience of audio while watching movies or listening songs its is just amazing, I was averagely satisfied with the camera as the night mode is not that good when compared with other phones, macro shots are very good but struggles a bit to focus, I did not find any much difference between slow mo and ultra slow mo, providing inbuilt custom stickers and emoji are good and enjoyable, speaker volume are good for a average noisy room conditions but not for listening songs outdoors, there are many gestures which takes time to get comfortable with but once you are life gets easier also there are many other features which proved helpful for day to day working environment, over all it is a best phone for average and heavy usage until and unless you are planning to play heavy games on it entire day long with heavy graphics requirementThank you 😁\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage. The new USB connector is a joy, with the option of high power charging for those urgencies when traveling.. backed by Amazon's super logistics and accessories options, this is a great buy!\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  My review after using the phone after 4 months of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.Pros:1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.6. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.Cons:-1. Night mode isn’t the best.2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.3. It doesn't come with earphones.4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.Conclusion:-If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.Regards,Yash\\n\\n\",\n",

The phone has the same issues tht samsung used to have 5 years back like getting changed,features like adaptive brightness doesnt work and pictures with 64 megapixel camera  leaves white patches on the face.phone has a lag and not fast .samsung seriously needs to review its product quality otherwise customers will surely dump it and go for Chinese brands\\n\\n',\n",

This was my first online purchase of this value and had concerns there. But was delighted as everything went smooth. There was a delivery OTP provided by Amazon hence the delivery person had to deliver to me in person which was good. I was worried that he shouldn't leave it with security in my absence. 2nd, the seller had packed it nicely, the primary pack seal by the manufacturer was intact hence a genuine new pack.

I was Iphone user and seriously I purchased this phone to get more handy with android OS.Camera: Too good. Many options and works in almost all condition.Sound: Dolby supports to Bluetooth and wired headphones. AmazingDisplay: No competition.. sAMOLED is doing its best. The contrast is such black even you cant make difference between the body black color and the screen black color. Phone looks very nice when I use dark mode.Battery: Monster battery, full usage will give you 1 and half day life. if average use then it will last for 2 days.Charging Cable: it is only 0.5 Meter, Samsung why why are you giving such small length wire? how much are you saving 50 INR? Also i found the charging cable is with poor quality.No Case: Generally silicon case we get by 150 INR outside, samsung would have given it then it was good. but its not there in box.Overall this product is superb choise if you have budget under 20K (for this variant of 8GB RAM 128 GN Storage)\\n\\n',\n",

Infact I want to thank all those involved in getting me  a replacement.Now for the phone itself. Big display--good display--but not HDR enabled though Vivid color setting does a pretty good job. I am not the Cheapo kind who takes selfies and uses a lot of Tik Tok so camera is not a big deal for me But the camera  is real good HDR pics are nice and slow mo and time lapse are amazing. Live focus is a amazing feature in camera. Sound quality is awesome and better than redmi note 6 pro which i was using earlier. Good snappy phone for daily app usage. I don't waste my time on games so no comments. UI is good with ease of use all around. Love the AOD display.Bought a sandisk type C usb otg but it didnt show in storage.

Highly reliable. It was time to change my old 3G Samsung mobile. Finally I settled for this one.Why M31?In my professional life, I worked on R&D, and fabrication of VLSIs. That made me a perfectionist in the field of photography. So  I was looking for an affordable mobile phone as an aid to my DSLRs. This M31 met all my expectations.The Samsung M31.The high-resolution front and quad-camera system at the rear. Excellent exposure sytem. Brilliant colour rendition. All these through world class Samsung display.The hardware is perfectly matched with its operating syste. I was amazed using its never-used-before features.

Battery life of the phone is awesome. On medium usage it lasts for 2 days. The charging time is 2.5 hours though, which a bit high for charging 6000mAh battery.2. Screen, colors and resolution all are a masterclass.  Samsung and its screen are the best thing to have. There is some bezel in the screen and I didn't like the idea of curving screen at the corners. It is manageable though.3. Touch and keypad are good and responsive.Cons1. Processor on the slower side. Good for its category but definitely not the best.2. I didn't like the build quality of the phone.  While the shape is sharp and finish is good, I find the phone little bit bulky.3. The menu and options are not the most user friendly. I used an Oxygen os before and believe me it was much smooth in sorting things.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Camera: 3.8/5Battery: 5/5UI: 5/5Fingerprint reader: 4/5Screen: 5/5The first and foremost reason to buy it is that its not a China brand. Had a Mi phone which stopped working after 7 months had to visit service centre to replace battery which has warranty of 6 months. Charged me Rs.1880 for it. After raise issue to Mi CS atleast they refunded my Rs. 524.Now, about M31 if you looking for decent phone with Amoled screen and bigger battery this the phone for you.For some people not having glass body may feel like a deal breaker but for me whi has used a glass body phone with back cover doesn't feel like much difference, phone is 90% of time in back cover.Camera id descent for thus price range, won't  say the best but gives satisfactory results and quad camera setup many more options to play with.Samsung needs to upgrade from 9611 processor but still for a user like me it doesn't  make any difference.Any body looking to buy a new phone can wait and buy M31s which has a better charging and screen.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This review is for users who mostly use mobile for calls, watching videos, some social media and photography!!Looks: This phone is Huge! For watching videos it is fun but handling it can be tricky... Plastic back is fingerprint magnet so cover is recommended.Screen: stunner! Big screen + amoled is great combination! Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.Always on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.Battery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.Few hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays)I am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.Charging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%(Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.)Performance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.Camera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.Attached some sample shots.Macro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.Wide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.Selfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.Video recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!Summary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt. Had to uninstall it manually)\\n\\n\",\n",

But after 1 month I chage my mind and believe it's one of good phone cader. Not bad as wat I have written below( my early review)Battery back up is too good and performance wise to its a MONSTER. Camera too good. The only area in which the phone lage is loud speaker. That they have to improve.👍👍👍👍🤳Thx allMy early review👇Very much Disappointed  with the product M31 I was previously  using MI A2. I bought this after so much research from review from Amazon.  The major disappointment was with speakers both loud speakers & phone speakers  quality  is not at all acceptable. Very cheap sounds never ever I used it before in my entire life time.I play free fire ( only game I have in my mobile)In MIA2 (6GB Ram ,128 storage ) I never got up hang my mobile. But in case of M31 (8GB RAM 128 STORAGE) I got hang every time 🤣🤣🤣If you have other options plz go for it. I will never come back to Samsung in my life time.I hesitate to go for redmi before I  buy MiA2. This time too I thought to for Mi. Still gone for Samsung. But it proved me wrong.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Hello All..I'm writing this review after few months of usage, but this should not be different as per my experience. I feel this instrument is having all necessary features in this price range for those who believe in smart work and nice user interface.I liked the most..- Android 10! Latest looks & works Beautiful...ahead of all- One UI is the superb experience as compared to other ones which are cheap. Feel the REAL look and damn useful features required for what is called as SMART WORK- Dark Mode is the best feature I wish for- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging.- 6000 mh battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support VoLTE...i really appreciate this- The Mobile Mic and speaker is good and clear- Camera is really good.  Video stabilization option is excellent- Face unlock, figure-print sensor response is quickAdditional requirement- I wish Samsung should provide a screen guard and back cover along with the handset. This is very good business trend and customer convenience. This will also help to protect the instrument from Day1 of usage.Finally the icing on the cake is..If you are thinking to buy a new phone, you can always consider this on priority being proudly Made In India. The day is not so away...MONSTER will surely beat the DRAGON\\n\\n\",\n",

People used to super bright screens will not like it.2. The max brightness is also not as much as other good quality phones.3. Battery life is ok at best. But that is because of Samsung os. You can enable it to kill more apps to preserve battery.4. Samsung one os is ok ok. Lacks many things in 2020! Scrollable wallpapers missing on home screen. Sms and calling app look outdated. App launcher is also ok ok. No issues have installed nova launcher. Can also recommend lawnchair.5. Sar value is low, so range is not max always. Some basic issues with wifi tooHope samsung will fix color tint issue and other os issues.So at almost 20k not worth it. But hey I bought it because it is not a Chinese phone. So extra money spent on nationalism. Jai Hind!\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Worst ever phone any one can buy ...really shameful that these type of third grade products are being sold on Amazon. I ordered a Samsung phone on 14th March it was defective so a replacement was sought on 20 th march but due to lockdown andreturn pickups not happening it could not happen finally Amazon person came in JUNE but refused to replace it as its outer cover was not there I pleaded but he refused to budge I was left with a defective piece so went to service center my phones camera ,Jack, battery have been replaced but still issues are there , a brand new phone turned out to be a dud...really shocking even now battery drains too quickly...in this price range many phones are available please dont go for it ..worst ever purchase with zero service from both amazon and samsung .P.s - there service  center will keep on saying that no parts are available and will keep your phone for around a week. So have another phone ready with you as you will need it.My honest advice dont buy this phone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is a short review after the first 24 hours of the M31 6GB 128GB black color phone I have bought. I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks  (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone,  buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly.  This is huge.So should you buy M31? Unless you are a high end gamer the answer is YES.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I am using Samsung Galaxy M31 last 10 days. I feel I made best choice this time.1. Android v10.0 OS with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor really good performance. No lagging.2. Excellent Display. Blue ligth filter is cool.3. 6000 mah battery is very usefull for continuous user like me. Fast charging & no heating problem.4. Camera is good. Macro performance is very good. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.5. Both dedicated sim slots support LTE.6. Mobile speakers sound is good but when I use earphone I am not getting full clarity.7. Finger print sensor response is compartively very good.8. When I ordered phone I was thinking it is big size but it is very handy..!9. Storage expandable upto 512GB is really usefull.I feel phone is really worth for the price & you may like to use it. Without doubt you may order.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Phone has a .massive battery as stated by Samsung 6000mah capacity.  But trust me it's useless. Battery backup in average moderate usage will not last even a complete full day by the end of the your battery percentage will be around 15 to 20. Which is really disappointing.  Trust me my honor 8x mobile with just 3450 mah battery gives a similar back up. What is the point of buying such a phone then. Camera is good. Low light capture is efficient enough at this price range. Finger print sensor is okay. Not great as my honor 8x has a lightning fast finger 3sensor when compared to Samsung. Also I found a sense of lag in the UI when going through the phone like pressing the back button for returning etc.  Samsung need to fix the bug for battery drain its drains like crazy. Disappointed with the battery.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  A nice phone for Rs 16000. It also manages tonplay asphalt 9 on highest graphics settings. Yes i did face a bit of heating issue. To solve it, update the firmware to latest version, Reduce brightness to minimum , turn on battery saver and turn on dark mode. It wiil solve most of the heating problem. U would still get a little heat while steaming youtube video, whatsapp video call or playing games or doing a phone call for some time or simply charging the phone but that's quite normal for any android phone\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Bought this product when launched at its lowest price, had to wait quiet long for the product after intense surveying because I was avoiding high end phones because life of each phone is nearly same, and during the pandemic it was of utmost importance to save each penny instead of spending freely and also wanted to avoid phones manufactured by China.I had decided to buy a phone within 20K and this phone gave me all features which are in top end phones(30K-40K), off course there is difference in the quality.1.Camera picture quality- Though it has nice cameras(number wise e.g 64MP,32MP) clarity of picture is not so good,but worth it in this price range.2.Battery- 6000 mAh it says but it isn't actually its 5825 mAH and I use a third party battery application called accu battery which is especially for battery its charging speed,health,discharging,sleep time etc. and it shows around 5400 mAH, so can't be sure of battery, though they have got a certification regarding this but am not sure.3.RAM- I have 8GB ram version and its worth it in this price range. Sometimes it lags but that is acceptable.4.Internal memory- 128GB its satisfactory, what is even better that it has a dedicated slot for memory card and since  had onnem my previous device I was happy in it.Overall speaking it is a good range phone, especially it is MADE IN INDIA, of a South Korean company.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  An average phone with decent features that are usually available with any Samsung Mobile.What i didn't like -1. High battery charging time of over 2hrs for 100%2. Phone heats up quite quickly. Upgraded OS and right on day 1, it got heated up during the upgrade3. Poor quality camera - but can't expect more from a 18k mobile4. Large and bulky - poor design- again, can't expect more at that price5. Performance isn't greatOnly good things1. Display - good for that price and size2. It is Samsung!What am I comparing with? Oppo, Poco & Samsung A series.Have always been using Flagship mobiles and this one was just a secondary mobile for home, yet it is not quite exciting.\\n\\n\",\n",

Its braking in just 2 mtr away speaker. Other phone I had it was super fantastic iPhone old though. It was working if its 10mtrs also.Facebook watch videos flickering. Need to close all n open again to view from scratch.Buggy and  bulky model.Dislike same old UI icons. Bulky design like old mobiles. Camera is fantastic.

You cannot expect a DSLR clarity for this price even if you have a 128 pixel in Digital zoom.If you are willing to buy only for a high quality camera, not a good choice. I have attached some shots, you can have a look and decide. Otherwise i am happy with my purchase 6 GB RAM & 128 GB Storage with a pretty good speed of operations.Mangal S\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a disappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.A little more details after a couple of months usage. This phone needs to be little more rugged as it can crack at edges and screen very easily. An aluminum/any metal body would be much better. The battery after 2hrs 20 mins charge can easily take you through the day with above moderate usage. For heavy users, still a fast charging option may be required at the end of day. I mean who keeps phone to charge for 2+ hours? You cannot risk charge it whole night too. Samsung has produced a nice phone. It could be a game changer with some more changes.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  White is not white. Screen is too warm in color. Video of human face has red tint. Selfie is totally horrible, it is beautifying fully and make clean face removing all the details. Signal quality is poor. Rs 8000/- phone redmi was connecting to internet without any issues and this phone was not. Also it was observed that voice will be heard after 5 seconds of call getting connected. This happens quite some times. Sound output is less both in speaker mode and in earpiece mode. I didn't expect so many issues with such reputed brand. Pl visit reviews with my above comments in google or GSM arena.com, many have brought out same points. But battery life is too good. Colors are punchy and vibrant but not natural  they are like over saturated.\\n\\n\",\n",

They've kept phone for 15days and then informed Tht, lcd is not available, you can collect coupon worth 10000 n can purchase any Samsung product frm Samsung store..Maybe several customers had faced problem alike me..

Camera is also cool, but not that great, but it is good enough for the price you pay.The only thing I am little disappointed was it has some lag while browsing and if it is improved, the phone really rocks for the price.Overall when compared to chinese phones in the market, Samsung is really doing good in terms of service, trust and the value of the product.Also, would like to thank Amazon for fast delivery and awsome service.\\n\\n\",\n",

Even after Zoom, details are very clear & No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear & stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent & reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality & long-lasting capacity).3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick & so far no single glitch.4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass. (also depends upon on the quality of your headphones like How much it supports to this technology)5)CALL QUALITY- Premium mic quality. Crisp & Clear voice calls. Supports almost all CODECS including Aptx6) RAM - Best RAM management, even after you play heavy graphics games along with complex tasks, you'll see approx 1.5gb still left. That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience & to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance & during multitasking & Gameplay.8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings. Recommending to use Built-in Game Booster feature for Thriving Gaming experience along with AMOLED graphics. Just Imagine.9)BATTERY - 6000mAh juice will give you an output of approx 2 Days on avg use & 1 day(20hrs) on heavy usage.SUMMARY -  If you looking for a maintenance-free consistent device for 3-4 years then Go for It without hegitation.\\n\\n\",\n",

Battery drained by 10% only.Phone is light weight.Wifi calling.5G wifi support.Loved this dark mode.Samsung VPN.Cons:Heating up issues as in all Galaxy M series.Camera quality is average.Full charge requires 2 hrs.Finally 15,999 for Samsung is ok to buy.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I received this pohne from Amazon yesterday. Let me start by saying that this phone is completely Made in India and the quality and finish is as good as any other imported phone that you will get.The specs of the phone are simply awesome and for the price it is an excellent buy. The Amoled screen is very good and has a Gorilla Glass hence there is no need for a screen protector, but no harm if you want to put one. It is advisable to have a back cover as the finish is shiny and could be a bit slippery.I have still not used the camera extensively but from the few pictures that I took during the daytime, they are very good.Took early for me to comment on the battery life but it comes with an awesome 6000 mAh which lasts for a very long time. Of course this will be dependent on what you use the phone for.It comes with a 15W fast charger. It charged the phone from 65% battery to full in little over one hour.Transferring all your stuff from your old phone to the Samsung M30 was a simple straight forward affair using the Samsung Smart Switch. You will need to download this on your old phone from Google Play Store. I did the transfer using the wireless mode.The specs of this phone are unbeatable for the price.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Samsung galaxy m31 is excellant phone and reasonable price. Battery life is very good as if we charge for 2 hours it's more than enough for two days.Its had very pixel and great clarity images.videos are amazing.Fingerprint reader is working .\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using M31 from last 3 months here are some pros and cons...Cons•Fingerprint sensor Dose not recognise sometimes, i tried to setup it again but had same issue. But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.• The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.•The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.• Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I’m noticing less lag. Just don’t get this phone for gaming the chipset isn’t good enough.Pros•Samsung is known for their Super AmoledScreen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.•On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn’t good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it’s average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.•LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.•This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you’re heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.So overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using  social media...If you’re heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn’t for you. So if you don’t play graphics demanding games on your phone you will like this phone....\\n\\n\",\n",

If you have your phone idle for sometime it cools down but then the instant you start to use it, it gets heated up. Can't have it over ear to speak on a call.PERFORMANCE : 4 starsCAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top. Being in bottom is so annoying that i couldn't place my phone over ground while on vid call.SCREEN CAST : Works perfectly.

       " '\\n\\n  The first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is its design. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is good.

       " '\\n\\n  Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don\\'t need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can\\'t use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and \"reduce animations\" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox securityDisplay: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experienceSound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that\\'s what Bluetooth speakers are for)Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that\\'s not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can\\'t sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table\\n\\n',\n",

Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30sAs a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  After using the Samsung Galaxy M31 with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage for more than 2 months, I list following pros and cons:A. Pros1. Very good display quality. Watching videos is a delightful experience2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast4. Apps load quickly as expecteB. Cons1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of \"fast charging\", which is very disappointing.Overall the phone is very good and highly recommended.\\n\\n',\n",

Dual SIM slot ( both supporting LTE) and dedicated memory Card slot is given6. Camera performance is really good specially the Macro feature.Cons1.

This phone may not come with features like punch hole display, in screen fingerprint sensor but after having used this I don't miss those features.

       " '\\n\\n  Update: 03Jun2020Visited Airtel store today and the customer care exec told me that all new phones autimatically switch to WiFi calling for better call quality.But I disagree.  Given the fact that WiFi calling is disabled in system settings, how can it be automatically switched to Wi-Fi calling?Still stuck. Samsung... Please help... Honour the phones system settings.-----First Review:The phone is very good in everyday usage.The only problem faced is that the phone automatically switches to WiFi calling while making or receiving a call despite turning off WiFi calling. The network is Airtel.This results in a situation where once the call starts, data gets switched off. No internet connectivity. So cannot talk and connect to internet simultaneously.Am writing this after a lot of googling to find a fix for this.The phone has April 1 2020 patch applied.Can Samsung or anyone out there help fix this problem?Also let me know if it is an Operator related issue (please mention what the operator needs to fix) so I can talk to the concerned.\\n\\n',\n",

Best thing is that i can move my apps from internal storage to sd card as most phones not allows this thing. It doesn't heat much even at games like Fortnite or pubg.

While sleeping keep it on maximum.These are the issues people are facing because they have not fully set their phones.Now,The camera is genuinely amazing. Night shot are extremely well colored and aren't dull.Processor - the exynos 9611Simply put it resembles 675AIE in performance than the 722 AIE. So, that's one factor you need to consider.What does it mean?It means playing  PubG in ultra graphics will be a problem. Just that, at the extreme frame rate the phone will not be able to do it.Note:only at extreme frame rate dies the phone sort of fails.For everything else the maximum RAM usage is 4.2 and then under device care ckean your RAM.

       " \"\\n\\n  Its been over 3 months now with this phone. Some highlights :1. super amoled screen- probably the best display in the 11 to 20 k rupees segment, hands down. Much needed if are like me and you read alot on kindle etc. Having used an amoled once, won't go opt for other screens ever!2. Free VPN with Samsung max, so better privacy3. Its Made in India, and the ultimate profits go to South Korea, where samsung is headquartered (not China).4. A pretty low Sar value. So a much safer phone than its competitors, especially Chinese brands, in terms of the amount of radiation u are exposed to.5. Battery life is not that great as they proclaim to be, but it's still good.6. The camera is pretty good in this price range, and the front camera also does its job pretty well. (Tip- you need to change snge the default resolution of the camera to 64 mp to utilize the full power of the lens. Many people don't do this, and then they write bad about the camera)7. A fast charger- thought not as fast as other high end phones, the charger is a good improvement from standard chargers in this price range.8. Much more reliable than Chinese brands, and rest assured, they won't steal your data and won't snoop on you.What it doesn't have - an IR blaster, But that's not a big deal.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I had high expectations on Samsung M31, but after  using  for about  one week I find it not very impressive. I'm writing  this honest  review as per my observations.Pros -1. Display is very good.Cons -1. Charging takes too long, from 30% to 100% charging, it took more than 2 hours.2. In regard to battery lasting, I don't  find much differencebetween my old realme 3 pro which has 4045 mah and this phone which is claimed to have 6000 mah battery. I have to charge everyday.3. Most irritating is while attending calls in our ears it automatically goes to onhold mode and also call recording  starts automatically while placing the phone in our ears though automatic setting is off. Samsung should really work with this issues and correct the software options during calls.4. Finger and eyes sensor is not so swift like my old realme 3 pro.5. Main Camera is also not very impressive upon comparing  my old phone but yes front camera  for Samsung M31 is better.I hope Samsung  will soon correct all these issues.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I got a 8Gb 128Gb variant. The phone is great value for money. I'm sure everyone's read the specs and are looking for more user experience insights, so here goes mine. I wanted to buy a phone which gets latest security patch updates at least for the next 2-3 years (else my office mail doesn't work). I also wanted one that was made in India and owned by an Indian entity. A phone meeting both requirements doesn't exist. So the next best option is a good phone (security  patch) made in India by an entity that does not have a Chinese owning entity. Options were Panasonic (Jap) and Samsung (Kor). I've used Samsung phones before so went for this which had the following pros:1. Made in India2. 6Gb/8GB RAM3. 64/128 Gb ROM4. Fast processor (handles heavy apps with ease)5. Smart finger print sensor with notification scroll feature6. Awesome battery backup7. Nice pics for this price8. Amazing display9. Great sound quality, enhances the music experience on external speakers too.10. Auto disable screen timeout when face detectedThere may be many more features I don't use.. but I'm a typical person mostly using for work and some web surfing. I don't play games so don't know.On cons (explaining why I gave 3 stars) is only one.. the first phone delivered started shutting down on its own after a day. I quickly raised a replacement request and I got a new one and that's working great but the hassle of having to do all that is not nice.  I also read that this issue is there a lot. So Samsung needs to take note and fix this.Otherwise awesome phone guys 15-20k range, this is by far the best phone. And it's made in India!! :) go for it guys!\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I'm reviewing this phone after using it for nearly two months. I bought this phone as a temporary replacement to my flagship. I'm actually very impressed by the price to perfomance ratio of this device. The biggest USP of this phone is its OS. Samsung's OneUI 2.0 has improved tremendously in reducing bloatware and managing RAM efficiently.  It multitasks with ease. The battery life is fantastic. I'm putting my device to charge every alternate day, the screen on time is at least 9-11 hours depending on the intensity of the usage. The Camera quality is great, not outstanding. The speaker is loud and clear. It has Dolby Atmos audio drivers for external audio devices. The call clarity is excellent from both ends. The rear camera does a great job but the front camera doesn't live up to the expectations. It smoothens the images taken from the front cam, not sure if it's because of the sensor or if its in the software. Since it's a budget phone I don't think it would be fair to expect a lot.  I'm not much of a mobile gamer so I never actually tested it in that aspect. The overall build quality is good, looks premium but the entire body is made of plastic. It nearly takes 150 mins to charge to a 100% with the 15W factory charger. The speed doesn't change even if you use a charger of higher capacity. Coming to the conclusion,  I feel this is the best budget phone considering the price and brand value of Samsung. It does its job perfectly and I'll definitely recommend this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.As per suggestion I updated phone immediatelyThe look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.Once this phone restarted on its own.Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.After 3 months, I experience the hanging once every week.Gets heat up a lot on video calls of WhatsApp, Zoom and Duo calls and restarts automatically.So overall, not recommended.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is my 4th Samsung mobile device having used different models over the years starting from Wave series.M31 is a definite buy if you are a heavy mobile user where battery, call quality and connectivity is priority.+ Battery has lasted me for more than a complete work day with approx 4hrs of talktime over 50 audio calls over mobile network, 5hrs mix of Microsoft audio call, Google meet audio call, atleast 30-40mins of what's app chatting throughout the day and almost an hr of social media including audio & videos with GPS always ON.Charging is pretty fast.Battery: 10/10+ speed of device which has been brilliant in multi tasking and switching between appsPerformance: 8/10+ support for airtel wifi callingConnectivity: 9/10Camera was never a priority for me however is pretty decent.Camera: 8/10What I didn't like is the bloatware that gets installed from Samsung Galaxy store. That's bit of a pain.OS Software: 5/10\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Premium phone for a great price.The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display with 2340x1080 pixel resolution. The display is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top.Samsung Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 operating system topped with the company’s own layer of One UI 2.0. The user interface is quite clean and the large app icons give a nice look to the device. There is also an app drawer where users can hide all the apps and can keep the home screen clutter-free. Like other Samsung smartphones, this one also comes preloaded with all the usual Samsung apps along with some third-party apps such as Facebook, Amazon, Snapchat, and others. Samsung has not included Bixby in the Galaxy M31 and along with this the Bixby Vision app is also missing from the device. The device also comes with Digital Wellbeing and Parental Control options which array of usual gestures. For instance, users can double-tap to wake the device and users also have an option to hide the three-button navigation layout and use full-screen gestures to control the smartphone.The camera is one of the major updates which comes with the Galaxy M31. The Galaxy M30s has a triple rear camera, while the Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup. The rear camera of the device comprises 64MP main sensor, 5MP macro camera, 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. On the front, you will find a 32MP selfie camera. The company claims that both the cameras are capable of recording 4K video. Samsung has also added Night Mode in the camera for better photography experience. Like always the Samsung camera app is pretty clean and easy to use and users can find different modes to shoot within the app. Along with this, the app also offers a toggle that allows users to switch between the primary and wide-angle lens cameras. There is also a Scene Optimiser present in the app, which quickly detects the scene and set up the camera accordingly. We were quite satisfied with the camera results of Samsung Galaxy M31. The device was quick to focus and also offered an ample amount of detailing in the images captured. Swinging on the wide-angle lens camera offers a wider field of view along with some really good images. However, we personally loved the macro camera which offered really detailed images. The images captured in daylight were better as compared to the ones taken indoors. The Night Mode incorporated in the device also does a reasonably good job and it reduces noise from the images taken during the night. The 32MP selfie camera does a satisfactory job as both the selfies taken indoor and outdoor turned out to be good.6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. Unlike other smartphone makers, Samsung has included a fast charger within the box. We were able to get through the day of mixed usage with a single charge, courtesy the powerful battery Samsung has packed in.The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you. The smartphone comes under the budget segment but it doesn’t look like one.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This was bought for my father. He was v skeptic buying this. We got this for 20,500 on emi. The phone reached in proper condition. The phone comes only with a charger & a pin to open the sim slot. What surprised me is that, no screenguard is already on it and we have to purchase one seperately. I already bought a flip cover for the phone which is doesn't actually do the guarding of screen for minor scratches. Samsung should pre apply a screenguard to smartphones, 20,500 phone and is not a small amount too. We checked the phone everything was good. The camera quality is sub-par. I am not impressed with the can quality. The music is playing well. All ok. Nothing wow about this phone.. just glad it will serve the purpose for my father. Will edit this review once I find out how is the phone working actually.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Disappointing. Can\\'t get worst than this. Firstly received a faulty phone which never got switched on. I did not have option to return, only replacement was available. It took additional 9 days for the replacement to reach me that too after multiple conversations and \"so called\" inspection and all. After all this when I got the phone which was fortunately in working condition, I\\'m not at all happy with the output1- finger recognition is not very good, you have to tap hard.2- Face direction doesn\\'t work on multiple accounts.3- phone takes forever for charging. How can they not provide fast charging in the phone of today\\'s generation?4- phone is extremely slippery. Impossible to use without cover.5- speaker volume is pathetic.6- camera quality is okay okay.7- picture quality is pretty good.I will not at all recommend this phone. I\\'m sure samsung was able to sell huge number of handsets but they are only trying to ride on anti-china notion going on currently. Since there are very less option if you do not want to buy Chinese phone, many would buy m31. However, this phone more look like \"something built in hurry in an effort to deliver at comparatively lower price but without much R&D\". Dear Samsung, I was not expecting this from you. We deserve better, you owe us better.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I will divide the review between pros and cons so as one can make informed choicePros:1. Camera creates stunning images.2. performance is good, though not checked any games.3. UI is really well designed, lot of customization available, need to skim through the settings.Cons:1. The battery lasts 1o hours with continuous hotspot ussage OR One and half day with normal internet and mobile usage.2.  Supplied 15W charger takes approx 2.30 to 3 hour to fully charge the phone.3. Camera Video artificial light performance is not good and get worse if slow motion mode is used.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Obverall performance is best. Samsung is Samsung.  Even better than socalled redmi series. Its display and dolby atmos sound is awesome. Main is speaking clarity over call which is supab. Battery life goes upto 2 days even after using it as hotspot device for my smart TV for more than 6 hrs. primary 32 mp camera takes gr8 pics. I won't say rear camera is not good. It is also gr8. But u can't use flash in 64 mp setting.  Fingerprint sensor and face unlock do its job well. Fast charge takes 2 and half hr to full charge from 10%. But I prefer more slow charger as that will increase battery life. And remember it has non removable battery. So why to worry if it takes 4 hrs to full charge. Overall go for it without thinking for alternate.But one problem, seller didn't supply ejection pin with the mobile. I don't want to return as mobile is superb. But seller must check such mistakes before delivery. For someone he may forget to send charger or even mobile. I would expect that delar to send the ejection pin seperately as I won't get it from market.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Yeah after 15 days of usage..heres my review about samsung galaxy m31PROS1.Amoled display of course the (best in midrange smartphones.)2.camera quality is awesome u must know fully about it and use.(I have attached a couple of shots.)3.Mega battery (lasts one day even if u do 5 hrs of gaming and 2 hrs of watching videos).4.Brand resale value of Samsung.5.Processor is fantastic for everyday usage and good for gaming.6.unexpectedly fingerprint  sensor works so good.CONS1.Stereo speakers are not so loud..they are just aaudible.2.Not a glass back just a polycarbonate body.3.Its an internet model and back covers are not available though im nt a backcover user but i tried finding some in the local market.4.Only two colour options.5.charging takes 2 and half hours to completely charge the device.6.some heating issue when using wifi.FINAL VERDICTThis is an awesome mobile from samsung that competetes with the likes of poco x2 and newly launched moto fusion plus.If u love an perfect brand to buy which gives  regular updates to keep the phone upto date then defintely go for it.😁\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Among the range of below 20K, this is the Smartphone, everyone should blindly go with buying without any second thought.It has the needed Elegant look, amazing screen display, camera, battery, Classy feel, etc. JUST GO FOR IT!! This phone has everything that I expected. Battery lasts for 2 days with normal use, listening to music for couple of hours a day including watching a whole movie on prime.Check the detailing of the camera took in the dark in the pic uploadedI have also recommended to my friends and families, and post me I have made them buy too :)\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  After 1 month usage, here is my review.I had been using Moto for years now but got fed up with not up to date build quality and poor performance. I am also not comfortable with UI that is far from stock android, so didnt give the chinese phones a look. So M31 was my best option.Samsung One UI with Android 10 is an absolute pleasure to navigate.6GB RAM is more than enough with 3.5 GB always available without any apps open.It multi tasks with ease.Screen is AMOLED Full HD and it completely blew your mind as a first time AMOLED user. The difference between AMOLED and normal screen is astounding. Once you get used to it, you won't be able to go back to normal screen. Best Display on a budget phone hands down.I was discouraged by other reviews saying Exynos processor is not good. However I have had no problems with it. Ofcourse if you compare its benchmarks with Snapdragon, it falls behind but that does not make it a bad processor. But trust me, looking at it alone, it is good with no problems. I haven't encountered any stutter or lag till now. Even gaming like Call of Duty and PUBG is perfect with medium settings. Ultra high drops some frames but that is expected of a budget phone. And anyway, gaming experience is perfectly fine on medium settings.Haven't yet tested camera with the lockdown going on but for normal user like me, I found it to be of good quality.Battery is a behemoth and easily lasts 1.5 days with normal usage. with 1-2 hours gaming, I need to charge it only once every morning.Because of battery its slightly on the heavy side but you wont notice because weight distribution is excellent. Feels extremely nice to hold. I strongly recommend getting a cover as the back is glossy and picks up a ton of smudges. That's the only con I experienced.Having used Moto G series and Moto X series in the past, I can safely say this is the best budget smartphone I have brought till date. Phones with specs like this used to cost 30-40k 2 years back. Absolute steal.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  For the price this phone has really surprised me in the camera department! The shots come out really good n detailed..the only big disappointment is the processor..even with 6gb ram the phone still feels sluggish like a 3gb ram phone...lags time to time..typing slows down..if you are a really fast typer you might notice it..battery charging speed is decent it fits the price range..display is beautiful..another big plus point..vivid mode on the warmer side gives out nice vibrant colours..speaker is average..I'd suggest you put in a few extra bucks n go for the 8gb variant as more ram will help run the apps smoother and may cause less lag.4/5* for this!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Simple and straight:Pros:- Battery- Display clarity, bcz it\\'s Amoled and also the size- Enough speed according to it\\'s configuration. Mine is of 6gb RAM- UI, i used Mi before and thought it was the best UI till i started using this. This ONE UI is too good but will let you know about Flaws in \"Cons\"- This one for Amazon, i purchased it with exchange of my MI mobile bcz of the recent revolution, u know. The exchange value was very good, thanks to Amazon.Cons:- Fingerprint scanner sometimes is non-responsive, have to use power button to awake screen- There is no multi tasking windows available in this UI- Media volume is not loud enough, Bass lovers can\\'t have enough loudness when playing music- No IR blaster, which is very useful, Samsung should provide atleast in future- No LED indicator for notificationThese are what i observed and mentioned as per my experience, may be useful especially for anyone going purchase or Samsung and for Amazon. Basing on these, you can consider your priority. Cons aren\\'t that big and few can be changed or updated. Finally I recommend for buy. It is a Good Mobile.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.Thanks!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Wonderful product!!Glad I bought this.It is more than 3 months now since I bought this phone!Battery life is excellent! I use my phone with wifi and data on with multiple apps running together. Even after 8hrs of use it consumes only  50 to 60 percent of the charge.Camera quality is also good.captures fine details well. The live focus is also quite good. For regular use and daily photography it is beyond sufficient.  I had seen few poor reviews about the camera, but it turned out good.The finger print reader is quick and responsive.Overall good value for money! With a sturdy back cover and a tempered glass it Is good to go.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  All are good but I don't think that 6000mah battery works like 6000mah ...battery life not up to the mark what I have desired ...samsung engineers must work on it .otherwise all things are perfect..compared to the price but those who say that 6000 mah battery goes for two days they are wrong  it works max 12 hrs on screen continuously but if u are not a hardcore user it works 1 day full. Those gyz who says in you tube that it works 1 and half day or two days ..that does not perfectly match with the reality.One more think charging time is very high u need 3 hrs to recharge it from zero to 100%. I don't have problem with the charging time but those who have problem with the charging time they may shift to a better option.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Best alternative for chinese phones by samsung . Not some major flaws but it would have been more great if there was a glass back than a plastic one but it's not that major flaw just put a good cover and  you are good to go. It has an good battery of 6000 mah and goes for 2 days straight . Camera is excellent . The combination of four cameras make the photo look awesome . The fingerprint reader is also good and fast . Samsung has given a seamless experience with stock android and no pre installed apps . I will recommend this phone to buy with closed eyes . Best phone under 20000 rs just go for it without further thoughts .\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Pros:Amazing Screen QualityOne UISamsung branding and serviceMacro PhotographyCons:Despite 6000mAh, I did not find it to be great. It was just good.Coming from an iPhone, I felt android phones' are way behind in Image processing techniques. Realized that pixel MP values are just to lure people and the real power of a camera lies in the Image processing.Rest everything is normal like every other phone.If you want to buy a Samsung 4GB RAM phone and macro photography doesn't matter for you, go for the M21. But If you are going for a 6GB phone, I would recommend you to spend those extra Rupees and get this M31.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Pros--1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT  CAMERA  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.3. 6000mah BATTERY  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.Cons--1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX  SECURITY  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.3. BUILD QUALITY  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.4. 15 WATT CHARGER  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.Note-1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.Pros:1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.Cons:1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  M31 is one of the best mid tier, made in India, \"budget smartphone\" out there right now for people looking for an upgrade from their entry level smartphones. The super AMOLED display, 6000mAh battery, 128 GB storage and a Samsung Exynos processor, that\\'s a little better from the top of the line 600 series Qualcomm Snapdragon line of processors are the strongest selling points. The UI occupies a lot of RAM, 1.8 GB on an average, and the battery performance isn\\'t mind-blowing, it\\'s great 1&1/2 days of usage easily (playing some games, watching YouTube for 3-5 hours), which you\\'d expect from a 6000mAh battery (I expected a little more). The camera is great, macro shots are well lit and crisp, 64MP main sensor senses colour pretty well, and the wide angle isn\\'t all that great, but it gets the job done, hyperlapse, slomo features are a great addition. Front facing camera is \"okayish\". The phone feels heafty and sturdy to the touch, and feels responsive overall, transitions to background apps are a bit jittery, but I believe it\\'s a UI issue, and not a performance issue. PUBG runs well, if you plan to play casually. Overall, I\\'ve been using this phone for over a month now, and I have no major complain. Totally recommend it.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Before zeroing in on the Samsung Galaxy M31, I researched the smartphone market in India and tabulated the data in terms of specs. For those looking to not give their money to the Chinese who are using the money to attack our country, among the Non-Chinese smartphones, the M31 presented the most bang-for-buck on paper.The M31 really good in every department, including in its massive 6k mAh battety, its AMOLED display, Android 10 OS, 6GB of RAM, 128GB ROM, Samsung's slick UI.At the sub 20K price range, the phone is an excellent buy.For photographers though not so much since it does not fully support CAM2API. Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k. The 6z supports shooting in RAW as well, unlike the Samsung M31.For the regular Joe though, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a pocket friendly Non-Chinese phone option that is compelling.Amazon's delivered 1 day ahead of schedule.\\n\\n\",\n",

You dont really zoom pictures more than your phone's size so why make the hype.About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use.Somewhere I also feel that this phone provides me more features than ios 13.

       " \"\\n\\n  So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.9.

Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. But this one is Mind blowing and amazing. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. Amazing Camera3. Battery: One of the best from Samsung mobiles. I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5. After using my previous mobiles, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight.6. i don't have any Complaints on this phone. Finally I love Samsung Galaxy M31.Go for it guys !! You won't regret. My rating 4.5/5.. :)\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Excellent product. Worth buying it.Pros:Massive 6k battery. Goes on and on.4 rear cameras with the main one at 64mp.Excellent front cam.Blue color looks stunning.S amoled screen with always on display.Finger print and face unlock work superb.Android 10.Cons:Limited bloatware, Samsung apps, which can be disabled at least which is good.Back panel absorbs fingerprints easily. Needs frequent cleaning.Doesn't come with an earphone. You can buy one outside per your choice.Suggestions:Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.Never look at M30 or M30s. You get M31 for the same price with much better camera.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Gifted this to my Bhabhi and she finds it really nice. Been a month and she is happy with the performance.I personally want that camera in any phone has to be nice. I really love the camera and inbuilt filters as well.Very easy to operate. No rocket science. Anyone can easily access. Even my 2 years old niece also opens YouTube and photos easily. 🤣😜Very good buy for the price you gave. Prefer it over other brands because of its features and reviews I read before buying.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  A complete mega Monster.  This phone brings back Samsung in competition with the Chinese brands which has captured the market share in recent years.Before writing this review, let me tell you'll a short brief on my requirements and background. I'm middleaged,  working professional from Mumbai and my requirements were basic usage with some multimedia at the EOD. And I'm not a gamer. This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this,  I've been using A popular known brand and model,  Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming.  And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Best thing about this Mobile is the BIG Battery & of course the Display is Top Notch.~ For Gaming also mobile fine, some say exynos is not that good vs Snapdragon chipsets but after using for 1st time i would say, not at all disappointed, because see if u can play Pubg in High settings and there not much heat then what else do you need, though there seems to be some lagging issue in higher settings for PUBG Graphics but basic & ultra settings works perfectly 👌.~ No issues with Sims (Airtel/ Jio)~ Best Display i have ever used (AMOLED)~ Sound quality also very good with speaker & also with earphones, atleast way better than my previous mobile (Moto X 4)~6000 Mah BATTERY ❤️ can't beat that with this price seriously 💯 easily works for whole day, on normal use u may get 30% on next day too,My location, Bluetooth, is always on for fitness band so with all these + fb, YouTube, insta , regular browsing, WhatsApp, pubg for 2-3 hours, i still get 25 - 35% at the night or next day morning, this is the best thing about this Mobile (Full Paisa wasoool hai 💯)~ 6gb Ram is quite good- nowadays u need atleast 6gb for smooth working, i haven't seen any hanging issues till now even after rough use believe me~ ONE UI 2.0 : I normally prefer clean stock android phones like Motorola, all my previous phones were from Motorola but u know it sucks now so wanted buy mid range with near clean stock android phone, so this my 1st Samsung Mobile, earlier i never liked Samsung because of there UI, but with ONEUI all is fine u get android 10 with all the Google features.~ Performance is also goodOverall i would definitely recommend this Mobile at this price range (i got this for 15,999)\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Believe me guys this is the best overall package u can get under 18k i have just brought a 64gb variant from amazon at 16k and trust me guys it exceeded my expectationsFirstly lets talk about the cons or negative points of the phone1. The polycarbonate back is a fingerprint magnet and is quite slippery applying a cover is  Highly reccomended2. The glass on the front is highly fragile and gets easily cracked. So applying a tampered glass is necessary.3. The front camera performs very poor in low light4. The fast charging is enabled by default but the battery backup is around 9hrs but if i disable fast charging i could get around 12 hrs of screen on time again that is a good thing because u can just charge it at night as it takes around 4 and half hours to charge completelyNow lets talk about pros:1. Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is  way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devicesIn the competition3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.If u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I'm using my Samsung Galaxy M31 for more than a month and now reviewing it.Below are the details that I feel and have have experienced during my usage.- sAmoled display: The best display one can get in the price range. It truely give flagship phone like experience in mid price range phone.- Bettery: Single charge works for me for more than 1.5 day almost with 3-4 hours daily calls, 2-3 hours daily live streaming, 24 hours net connected. It gets 15W fast charge which takes almost 3 hours to charge this power house from less than 10% to full charge.- Camera: quad camera setup does it job well. 64MP Primary camera takes decent photos in day light. Live focus also works great. Macro is fine too. Ultra wide mode is also good. Though it has night mode but shows noise. 32 MP front camera is best in this segment.Processor: Exynox 9611 works absolutely fine for day to day life. I'm not a gamer so not sure about gaming performance. Apps open without any issue and don't feel any lag.UI: One UI also gives the best experience. It is very smooth and easy to use.The other good thing about this phone is that Samsung is providing McAfee security in this phone which no one will find in Chinese phones.So if you have the budget of 17-18k for new smart phone and want to get smooth and best experience in this price range, please go ahead and buy this phone. But if you less budget around 14k the go for Galaxy M21 in which one will get tri camera setup instead of quad in M31 and have 64GB internal memory which should also be sufficient and rest of the features list are same as M31.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Been 2 months using this phone. Overall performance is good. Went ahead and chose this product because didn't wanted to go for Chinese brands.Less rating because only after 2 month of use suddenly touch pad stopped working. Wend ahead forced power off/on it worked. But only to become unresponsive next morning. Immediately rushed to samsumg cerive center in Malleshwaram Bangalore. They checked and replaced entire touch and screen panel free of cost as it was under warranty.This might be one of rare case but it happened with my device only.All other features 5 star camera, battery and user experience.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Everything is better than expected. Just one thing can't resolve: JioCall app doesn't work. Though jio internet works, calls also are ok. Only app itself is not ok. I tried to check sim setting, mobile data settings, to restart the phone, everything - but nothing helps. Maybe there's no need of this app actually as soon as everything works without so it's ok.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Really great phone at a great price. I have been using since two months..runs smoothly without any lag. The best thing is the display. Amazing amoled display with true black which dramatically enhances the user experience and the infinite display is a plus.The camera is quite good. amazing picture quality with a good resolution. Front camera is quite good and convenient for video calls. 64 mp camera, along with wide angled camera are some cool featuresBut it becomes little bad when you zoom.. like water coloring... image processing can be improved. But is acceptable at this price. Dont expect picture quality like that of an iphone or a 30000 plus phone.Battery is good enough for me. As i use it only for calls and browsing and normal regular use like watching movies, YouTube...it gives a decent battery support and lasts upto 1 and  a half day. Not suitable for gaming purpose. Doesn't feel like 6000 mAh. Might be because of the Amoled display as each pixel actively consumes power. Although, black screen uses no power as compared to LCD, still Amoled consumes more power than an average LCD or LED display. Again, battery performance acceptable at this price when compared to the other cool features at this price.Fingerprint sensor works smoothly.And at last, amazing looks and i really like the ocean blue color and the sides are gradually blackened! Stunning looks.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing this with my experience of 10 days usage.Battery::I have used many models. Battery wise this is the best mobile I ever used. I use my mobile heavily (personal use, office use, video streaming, net browsing, gaming). For me it is giving 1 full day.Finger Print Scanner::Working accurately but little slow compare to Lenovo and honor mobiles.Camera::Camera is good but not up to the mark. Infact I have a disappointment on this section. Taking too much time to sharpen the picture. Difficult to take children photos. But overall is OKAY... It's camera is good in daylight but in low light conditions picture quality not good.Performance::I give you 5/5 in this section. All previous apps are being saved in memory while your phone put in rest aside. Fast and memory recollection is awesome.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  One of the best mobiles I have purchased.Pros: Amazing battery life as it has 6000 mAH battery.Awesome camera. Set it to highest quality if you dont mind space occupied 🙂.Capacity is 64GB which is pretty good.  However you have the option of having a 512 GB microsd Card. I intend to have 128GB card installed so that I can use it as an external drive of sorts 😀. Call quality is good and so is the internet speed handling. All in all very good mobile and I am quite happy using it.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Nice display and battery backup. Don't expect perfomance. Good for candy crush level games. Processor is old. At this price today's competition you'll get better ones. Let's be honest. Camera is pathetic. No difference between 16 and 64 MP . I am not a 'mobile gamer' since this device can't do much in there. Also lots of bloatware by samsung. Unnecessary waste updates and apps. Only good things is the battery backup and display. Sound not so great. I don't know why they put a Dolby feature. No change in sound in headphones. Its a Dummy . Speaker an average performer.. Fanboys can suck it. No need to spend this much money for the crappy perfomance. I bought it for 17499 for 6 GB 128 GB variety. Body is cheap plastic. One of the worst kind .Glass breaks easily\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Consider Other choices also.Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.No notification LED.Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  A big NO for gamers but simply awesome things are -1. of course the AMOLED Display.2. 6000mAh battery3. Main 64MP Samsung sensor with good image quality.4. wifi calling feature.5. dedicated SD Card slotBut some other facts to consider -1. in Pro mode camera 'shutter speed control' and 'focus control' is missing.2. Volume Rocker and power button are cheap plastic, although it gives good tactile feedback.3. have to very careful through the setup process, otherwise, you will get lots of unwanted notifications.4. you need a good protective cover to prevent scratches.5. Charger cable/Data cable, provided is short.6. u will feel Battery is taking so much juice to compare to snapdragon SoC, because of Exynos 9611 processor. but u 'll get 1.5-2 days of battery for normal usage.... I hope this will help u to decide before buying this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Its been like more then 2 weeks since i am usig this phone with my primary sim.I have been testing all the features and usability this phone offers till this time and now i feel i can give my thoughts about this device.So lets make pointers:-Built: I feel the phone has amazing built Quality. Whereas Yes, the Plastic back won't feel much premium but it is actually much more practical then glass back phones. Yes it can scratch easily but who uses a phone without a cover as i would suggest to get a premium cover to get that premium feeling.Talking about Glass back phones it would be very costly to replace but the plastic shell of m31 would be much more cheaper.-Display: As you already knew its best under 20k segment. Better then other Amoled screen and No Crazy 120hz refresh rate but yeah it feels much better to use.-Software: I was using a stock android device previously and the experience of oneui is actually not bad its smooth and even fun to use. There are some hiccups here and there which is acceptable but one thing is that recent app menu lags alot while switching between apps ruining all the experience.It can be fixed via some software updates.Hardware: Phone is not heavy. The buttons are placed right, good quality buttons gives premium and positive feedback. Fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate too.-Camera: The camera quality is actually very good. All the cameras are quite usefull if you know how to use them. The Wide angle and macro camera is also good but implementation is not that great a software update can fix that too.For the night i can say that the shots are blur and grainy if you can use the camera properly then you can take some amazing shots like i do so for me the night camera is also good not great. Whereas some updates can do improvements to it.-Battery: Best battery life of any phone i have used till now. Yes the charging speed could have been better but the battery life is soo good that you will hardly rush for a charge.Note* first charge heats the device bad but after 2-3 days of usage it gets back to normal nothing to worry about. My device doesn't heatup now.My usage includes all day 2active sims, 50% brightness all day, wifi/data ON 24/7. 2hrs Gaming,1hr youtube,  Some calls, and all day social media.With a usage like this, my phone starting from 100% in the morning to 2nd day evening dropping to 25-30%. I never let my device go below that. Even the stand-by time of the phone is great.-Performance: Its fast and fluid. Whereas the ram management could be Better which can be fixed. No heating issue. Good for normal to heavy gaming. Overall the performance is Very Good of the device.This device is not specified for a single use. Its practically a straight forward device which allows the user to use it as a phone should be used. The phone doesn't offer any hanky panky Stuff for attention making anyone mad for games nor for tiktok.Verdict: If you are a rough user or you travel alot, if you are not a mad gamer then you can go for this device.It offers best practicality and usability thats how a phone should be.\\n\\n\",\n",

With a moderate use it is giving fully two days service.Camera is also awesome in this price range in both day and night mode. But it can't say as 64MP.There is no heating and lagging problem till now.Charging is very fast. But one thing I found as cons, it's network capturing quality is little worse as compared to Vivo mobile phones.  Otherwise it is a quality product. I would like to suggest everybody to go with this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

The battery which is 6000 mah even with a heavy phone usage will easily last you through the day and even more.4. The finger print reader works well.5.

I have received my phone on 8th March ,ordered on 5th march when the sell has started.when I took this in my hand ,feel very light weight if comparision to 6000mah mega battery, I watched a movie of 2hour and 5 mins and it consumed only 20% battery ,battery life is very great ,it runs approx 1 to 1and half day after full charge. Charging time is approx 140 minutes.Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up. Worth for money...\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smoothBattery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expectScreen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decentCamera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp camProcessor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 is the Perfect package out there. The Mega 6000mah battery easily gives me 2 days of battery backup. The 64mp camera gives amazing details in the photos. And the best part is, you can also take macro shots, not just with the macro lens, but with the help of 64MP camera too.I was looking for few of things from my new phone. I wanted a great camera, great battery backup, unique and elegant looking design on the back of the phone. Samsung Galaxy M31 provides all of it. Plus a Super-AMOLED display. Samsung is THE best display manufacturer out there. The exynos chipset is no less than any other chipset in the market.This phone has made me decide that my future phones will be of Samsung.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This phone is not as good as we expected. I bought it on 18 March 2020. So I am using it for more than 4 months. I was super excited while I saw the features like battery, camera, screen size all in my budget. But from past 1 month, I am facing an issue. Sometimes while I use the camera or watching a video and sometimes while I play the game into it, its screen gets completely black. If within 4 months I am facing this issue then I don't expect that it will work even for a year. Completely disappointed with Samsung. I won't go for Samsung in future.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Best device around 16k-17k. Overall 4.2/5.Build quality not good. I mean just nice. If i rate it then 3/5. Actually the back of the device is made with polycarbonate so If it were glass, it would be the best all-rounder device in this budget.Screen just superb. 4.7/5.Camera quality also nice. 4/5.Performance also good. I used Samsung J7 prime for 2 and half years. So i know what is the problem with exynos processor. So there exynos 9611 also good processor for approx 2 years. But then this is behave just a 7k-8k budget device. If there was a Snapdragon 712 or 720G processor, it would definitely be rocking device from SAMSUNG under 20k budget. Okay  but the current performance is really smooth and cool. So 4/5.Fingerprint scanner good but also have face unlock option so no problem for device lock security. Both work fine. 4/5.Battery gives approx a day with medium usage. 4/5But charging time really slow. 6000 mAh battery takes time to getting full charge around 2.5 hours. 3/5. Ok let's talk. I think i covered all the pros and cons. Then you decide that what should you do, buy or not buy. If you ask me then definitely go for it if you watch movie and video with decent gaming. I don't think of any other mobile for watching movies or videos. The screen just AWESOME. That's all.\\n\\n\",\n",

Smooth and buttery experience.Display(Super Amoled FHD+)is gorgeous. Viewing angles are fantastic and color reproduction is amazing.Processor(Exynos 9611) is quite powerful.

It keeps hanging frequently. While operating any application on phone, it stops responding along with this is issue the speaker quality has become very low (basically it does not functions) No Sound at all. Even while playing random videos on YouTube application as well in the phone's gallery it automatically gets fast forwarded without giving any command.Its altogether a very disappointing experience not only with the Samsung Phone Brand but also with Amazon Prime Membership Account and the online Retailer (STPL Exclusive Online) listed on Amazon.I would request to please get the Product replaced Asap, as Due to lock-down I am unable to even take it to Samsung Service Center or to any Mobile Repairing Shop.Note: Kindly Respond to the above complaint, or legal action will be taken further at your Cost.\\n\\n\",\n",

It's a gimmick. A good 13 mp is equivalent to the said 48 mega pixel.

Because it took more 2 hours to complete charging.# It's auto brightness feature not working properly.# With Pubg type games, I'm having a slightly display resolution problem on its edge but only with selective games app.PROS you know very well so, I'm not gonna mention.

Overall Handling is quite satisfying. With an Amoled Screen and a good resolution perfect for binge watching. You can switch between Vivid and Natural colours though (don't know why it comes in vivid default).2. Has a 64 MP rear camera with ultra wide and depth however as anyone would have a nick for wanting the best, there still is room for improvement.3. Comes with Face recognition and Finger print scanner, however there is a fraction of a second's lag while unlocking the phone. Recognition does get better with more use.4. Has an inbuilt Optimiser in the UI with anti-theft features to clear up memory,check battery usage and scan through an inbuilt antivirus. So that is an addition, however a third party antivirus should still be used as back up.5. The smartphone boasts of a 6000mAH mega battery and it lives up to the figure with 9-10 hrs of battery if used continuously and upto 2 days with normal to minimal use(Frankly speaking I gifted the phone to my mother and was surprised to see it working at 28%, the day after it was charged..also it was charged in the evening around 5 pm...so still not 2 days). The Charger supports fast charging but I wouldn't compare it to One Plus' dash charging as it would take upto 150 mins to reach full charge on M31.Eventually I did want to buy one more for myself,but there already is one M31 in the family.A great buy.\\n\\n\",\n",

It is amazing in revealing details of close up picture (you can see clearly and  detail of these tiny roof moss/algae, 3.5mm headphone jack was used for size comparison. When I use for scenery photos are good too. Only problem I found is sharpness of photo at highest zoom ( zooming photo to its highest) I think sharpness is good but not best. Samsung should improve processing of photo for excellent shrpness otherwise what  is benefit of giving better lens. I usually use  Adobe lightroom. Last 2 pics were processed in lightroom.

I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.I want to explain it's some feature as below1stly Battery 5star2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.3rd Front camera - 4star.4th Processor - 4star5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4starThese all ratings are out of 5.Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..\\n\\n\",\n",

It fell a couple of times from bed but the curved edges on the sides have prevented it from getting scratches. I don't like putting case or screen protector as it increases the weight and reduces the aesthetics. Also, don't put keys in the same pocket as it can give permanent marks on the glass.

       " \"\\n\\n  There's hardly anything that i dont like about this smartphone. Brilliant  performance, brilliant battery life, amazing camera, brilliant overall.1. The screen.sAMOLED display  is on point, super clear & very well user friendly.2. The camera.Stunning. 64mp does the job the way it's supposed to. Front 32mp camrea is also very impressive. In the rear, quad camera setup is impressive. The sample images are a few example of the camera quality. Also the wide angle lens is a rather wonderful function.3. The battery.Probably the biggest highlight of this smartphone is the battery. A MASSIVE 6000mAh battery can easily go on throughout the day with enough battery life left for the next day. For an average user, the battery will easily live upto 2 days. Heavy usage? It will still go on for a day. Even when the battery is about 15 to 20% the performance doesnt show any decline. The only thing i found a bit not so good about the phone is the charger. M31 comes with a 15W charger which will take atleastaround 2.3 hrs to charge fully. But the new M31s fixes the problem, it comes with a 25W charger & the same 6000mAh battery promising shorter charging time.4. Built quality & design.Front and rear looks impressive. Has a very modern yet conservative designs. Doesn't feel that heavy while holding and is also a perfect fit in the pocket.The blue colour looks beautiful but the one i have is a black one. Yes, the black looks cooler but since the rear is made up of plastic with a glossy finish, it can very easily attaract scratches and fingerprints,  so I'd suggestanyone to use it with a mobile cover.5. Verdict.Overall the smartphone is an impressive package. It simply proves that spending over 50k on a smartphone is insane. Some complain about the processor that is Exynos 9611 which is in my point of view nothing to be worried about. Every function runs smooth and easy thanks to the processor and 6gb RAM, touchscreen is also very responsive,  also the power button can be used to open apps as a shortcut. With 128gb space, dual sim support, 6gb ram, a great battery life, sAmoled display, this phone has everything that it takes to be a flagship phone competitor as a considerable margin. Its almost been more than 2 months since im using this phone and so far i haven't faced any problems with the device any hopefully will not face any in the coming future. The surprising thing is that with all the power packed in the box, it still manages to fit under 20k category which makes it incredibly appealing. I'd surely suggest if anyone is looking to buy one!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  My previous two phones were Redmi note 3 and Redmi note 5 pro mainly because of the specs it offered and was th best option available that time. Well my heart wanted to again buy a Redmi phone again but mind did not allow that maybe anti China sentiments(not naive) and thought of using something different. Lets test try the change.They increased the price of the phone by 1000 rs during lockdown and it did hurt me but I still went ahead with the phone. I am using 8GB 128GB model. (Rs19500). It cost me 2k to 3k compared to other phones but dimag tha jo mann nai raha tha.Amazing battery. It definitely last a days use and I mean it even when you use it extensively apart from gaming. Surfing, videos, movies , you can do alot of other thing it will last 20 -28 hours and battery wont disappoint you.Security: i felt more secured using a Samsung phone than the redmi phones that i have used earlier. This is something personally what i have felt.Camera: Camera quality is good and i did not get lags while clicking pictures. Honestly I do not click much pictures so this does not really matter to me.Display and Touch: Display is fine but screen gets streched, related to resolution mainly so you may not be a able to see the score of football matched on the left corner, or youtube subtitles in the full screen mode. Touch could haven better i felt and more quick.Performance: I did find issues here and i am really disappointed with the performance even though i compensated with higher ram i do feel lag while opening apps switching between apps, handling multiple task and lag here and there. I am bit skeptic not sure how much the performance degradation will happen down the line. The performance is not seamless and not upto the mark. could have been better.Ui: i am not enjoying the samsung ui and it is complicated and it does not have basic features of spamming callers or catergorzing or app lock and takes time to search through the settings option(major lag there). The navigation is difficult. I really enjoyed miui.Sound Quality: Decent not amazing not bad..okaish it wont thrill you. Could have been better.Gaming: I am not using this phone for gaming and not sure how it work but i think it wouldnt be a great performer with high end graphic games.For me Battery and Performance, ui should be top notch.  that is my only requirement. 5 for battery, 3 for performance and 2.5 for ui.There are far better phones available then again non-chinese this is the only best option.This is will get done all you day to day activity.Maybe an I buy an iPhone next time would make me an I-diot? Lol.\\n\\n',\n",

Takes 2 hour to full the battery from zero which is less. Fast 15 w charger. If you are going for 6gb ram 128 gb I would prefer go for it. Talking camera i was amazed to see wide photos with high clarity. Selfie too has added advantages. Thanks samsung for making a high end mobile at this affordable price. Also samsung is made in india. So people go for local.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  The overall Phone design and handling is okay but lacks quality both in the the material used and the software performance. I've been using this phone for over 2 months now and all I can say is that I shouldn't have taken the negative reviews lightly. The phone lags even with minimal activity. The fingerprint sensor is almost insensitive and reminds me of old samsung phone touch screens. The camera quality is amazing but only after you adjust the settings to different(highest) resolution. Battery life is subpar and way lower than what I thought a battery this size would perform but the fast charger takes care of that problem to some extent . The inbuilt operating system lacks any applock which has to be installed from play store. The phone is okay for someone who doesn't use or expect much from his/her phone except basic functionality but I'd recommend going for a different phone if you're a heavy user or for gaming.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Cons:Heats up a lot :The phone heats up a lot along the upper body during charging and gradually the entire display gets heated up . you wont be able to make calls on the phone just after unplugging  due to excessive heat.RAM usage :Phone after factory reset with no apps running consumes whooping 3GB RAM .  So the 6GB RAM is a MYTH. You hardly get 2GB of RAM space  for your applications .Memory : Out of the 64GB of memory , the system UI and OS takes a whopping 12GB of memory space .Pros:Camera is decent  and Fingerpint access is quite smooth.Summary: Phone heating up is a huge disappointment. Not sure if the product is user safety compliant\\n\\n',\n",

I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography.

Try googling this issue for M31 and many other users are frustrated. Best part is there is no solution to it. Next problem is its too slow, it doesnt matter if it has 8 GB ram and 4.5 GB shows as free, if you just try to scroll a whatsapp chat window, or simply type a text message, first word starts to appear on the screen after you have typed entire sentence. A usual \"suggestion\" given by ppl is free up RAM and storage or disable  \"auto-restart\" in device care (which is not even enabled). My phone is almost new and i dont play games or do heavy multi tasking. Ram is never 50% utilized and storage is hardly 30 GB used out of 128 GB and yet you cannot even type a text message nicely.On the positive side, camera and battery are as expected. However, trust me, you\\'ll get frustrated by its lag and restart feature.Verdict :- Its a trash.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  What I am impressed is the camera quality in night time. The  battery life is long enough to keep you occupied for the  whole day. Now the charging speed is not best in class but its fast. I loved upgrading from my old phone. Moreover Amazon allowed me to exchange my old phone that brought the price of the phone in my budget. Thanks.Many customizable features for dark mode, blue light, game recording etc are best.On the downside. You will feel lack of snapdragon processor during heavy gaming. Otherwise I would have given 5 star.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  What I Like on M31(30days Review)Value for Money ProductSamsung One UI 2.0 (best UI among all UI's)6.4 inch, 403 PPI, Super AMOLED display (Best for Always on display, Best for Black, also helps saving battery as black pixels are not lit).Battery 6000 mAh(Amazing Battery Backup, Lasts almost 1.5 days for even an heavy user like me).Camera 64 MP Back/32 MP Front (I have attached sample photos).No heating issues at all in 30 days usage.What I don't Like isNot able to upgrade to 2.1 One UIExynos dosen't support GcamFast changing with15W is very slow takes approx 2 hours to get fully charged.\\n\\n\",\n",

In night camera seems horrible.In Audio department M31 inferior to Realme 1 , m31 lack its sound quality and also bluetooth codec Ldac .But decent audio output guaranteed.Pros;BatteryDisplayWidevine L1FingerprintDolbyCamera (in good lighting)One UI (No so much junks, Very clean compared to Realme UI&MI UI)Cons;Low light photography horribleVideo shootNo caseBattery optimizationLack of LdacSecurity patch### Rised Replacement request  , phone switchoff frequently  ,\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Device is overall good, But I must say that camera quality is not upto the level I was expecting it being a 64MP camera phone.Front camera photography is a not good in dark and images appear very grainy. Talking about image processing Colors are oversaturated and during video calls you could see a yellow tint. This underperformance of the front camera is because of the notch design as there is less space in the front for another camera/ flash.The rear camera is somewhat good in photography and and the videography is pretty good.BloatwaresWith this phone Samsung has targeted the  budget phone section as they were falling behind the likes of other Chinese manufacturers. Though they have packed this phone with massive features but it comes with  a trade off i.e. Bloatwares and sponsored app downloads. If you are wise enough to bypass those app promotions you can happily use this phone.Overall, I am satisfied with the phone because I didn't want to go for Chinese companies. But still I miss Good front camera.\\n\\n\",\n",

When I complained on the video quality, I was told to use super steady mode.I have attached a video  shooted in super steady in the same mobile which was like the old video cassette we use to watch during 90s.Do check that before you invest your money in this smartphone.\\n\\n',\n",

Yet, the Samsung M31 got my attention right at the moment I saw it on Amazon.And it has surpassed all my expectations and more. I've never been this satisfied with a phone's performance at this price range.It is absolutely amazing in all aspects from camera to battery. Performance is smooth. I'm not a gamer but occasional PUBG was a lag free experience.Overall, this is the best you can get for 17K right now.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  M31 is equipped with all the features what one wish to have in mobile. After reviewing all makes and comparison, I choose to have M31 and I must say, my decision was not wrong. Amazon delivered the product before their committed date. 6gb Ram, 128gb Storage, Octa core, 64MP quad Camera is more than enough. Functional Performance is very good. 6000mah Battery performance is too good. No need to charge even for next day. Camera also delivers good picture quality throughout day and night. Sensors like Biometric & Compass are very useful. I am truly enjoying M31. Samsung has indeed done a great job by launching M series compared to other make mobiles at very competitive price.\\n\\n',\n",

Samsung should develop this camera's performance asap.Battery is fantastic. Gets thru 2 days easily.UI & moderate multitasking is smooth.Hardware is well built and feels sturdy.But still, added protection of screen guard and case is must.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Remember:* Galaxy M series phones don't have Knox security, so you won't get features like Secure folder, Samsung Pass, Samsung Pay, and other Knox-dependent services.* Galaxy M series phones run One UI 'Core', so features like Good Lock, Bixby are not compatible.* Samsung phones generally struggle in network reception in areas where coverage is poor. If there's strong network coverage, then you won't notice any difference.Otherwise, it's a decent phone for at around 15k.\\n\\n\",\n",

Fingerprint reader non-responsive sometimes2. Camera quality is only decent. Pro mode does not give much options like ability to adjust aperture and shutter speed. Maybe you can get access to those from some other app in the play store.3. Touch unlock available but not touch lock which could lengthen the life of the power button. Again have to depend on some play store app for this.Overall a great buy for anyone looking for fair performance and good battery life.\\n\\n',\n",

Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah3. Display is crisp and very sensitive4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.Cons:1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Giving review after Using it for two days.  Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.Pros-1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.Average features-1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.Cons-1. No cover provided within the box.2. No headphones provided.3. No Samsung secure folder.4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. 👍\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I bought the Samsung M31 6GB 128GB version for 16k. I use mostly online shopping apps, Streaming apps, chat, video calls.Pros1. SAMOLED screen, Pleasing to look....2. Battery life, for me with moderate use it lasts for 2 days.3. Camera Front and Back. Especially I love the Front camera...For selfie lovers it is a boon. Back camera is good but I can spot some color deviations in pictures taken using back camera as the real color is not seen in picture. But for me it is not an issue as I not using it frequently.4. Stylish looks.5. No major heating issues as I could see persons having competitors mobiles are complaining a lot about this.6. Even after 20 to 30 drops I dont see any visible even minor damage to the screen or body. Very well built device.Cons,1. Finger peint sensor and face recognition takes bit longer time then competitors devices to detect.2. Plastic body behind is fingerprint magnet and also can be easily scratched with out case. I dont like using a case so it is a issue for me.Even if you use a case you have to choose a good quality one as the bad ones themselves leave some scratches in long use3. Charging time...I know it is directly proportional to battery capacity but bit more faster charging would have been handy. Tome charging times are 3 hours 15 mins with normal charging and 2 hours 35 mins with fast charging.4. Whenever there is a software update mobile also shows a list of recommended apps that should be installed to complete the update. This came skipped but still it is annoying.Gamers.. please forgive me as I am not going to mention anything regarding the gaming performance as I have never tried even a single game with this mobile.Mobile is worth the money and my Rating is easily above 4 but if metal case and bit more faster charging options are provided I will be happily rate it 5.Thanks for the patience to read the complete review.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Alert: This will be very common man review not a technical one so if you are looking for technical review kindly skip it.Samsung M 31 has been great buy owing to its monster battery  life. I am a new mom and purchased this mobile  when my infant was 2 months  old. The battery lasts pretty long even after playing multiple YouTube videos and being on long video calls (due to lockdown). I don't get time charge my phone properly though.Sound quality: The sound is loud and clear over calls and also during entertainment sessions of movies and video.Camera Quality: The reason I opted  this phone was I wanted  good camera to capture precious moments of my little one. So far it has been serving  the purpose. I can't comment for outdoor photography as we are all home bound owing to pandemic.Screen: The display colours and picture resolution is great owing to full HD Amoled Display. But Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is my savior as my mobile has been kicked and slipped multiple times (I am using it without a screen guard and back cover). Further  the Accidental Touch feature is awesome as I mostly  have an infant in hand while using the mobile.Body: The body is non slippery offering good grip but there will lot of finger impression left on back.Fingerprint Sensor: Only thing that doesn't  pleases me its fingerprint sensor quality which could have been better. It takes times sometimes  or I have place finger multiple times.Face recognition features works well for me and it unlocks the phone from various angles even when I am using spectacles( this becomes a problem in various other mobiles.)Overall I am happy  with the purchase so far after two months of use.\\n\\n\",\n",

The camera to my surprise almost competed with 7T's even though it's half of it's price point.Pros:1. Camera - I find the camera to be pretty good at this price point. Both the front and back cameras have good depth. The macro camera could be a bit better but does the job for a budget smart phone. I have attached photos I clicked (clearly not a good photographer), the first is of a odd little spider using the macro camera, the 2nd and 3rd of the 64 MP camera and the 4th of the front camera2.

It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support.I'm giving this review after using 1 week.Pros:Camera : The Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup at the back and a single 32-megapixel selfie shooter. The primary camera on the Galaxy M31 has a 64-megapixel resolution and f/1.8 aperture. This camera takes 16-megapixel binned shots by default but you can switch to the full resolution. There's also an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree field of view and an f/2.2 aperture.Battery : I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again. 2.5 hours to full chrage.Games:If you are a professional gamer, I suggest you to go for MI brand. MI provides slightly better graphics. Overall gaming experience is nice on M31Cons:Nothing as of now.  Note : When I plugged into charging phone will slightly heatup.I bought it 2  Phones as 6GB and 8GB with 128GB storage.\\n\\n\",\n",

The camera inbuilt AI features are very helpful and easy to use.  Overall I taken the right decision choosing this phone and that too with so many features within the reasonable budget.

       " \"\\n\\n  Perfect mix of hardware and software to perform not just daily tasks with ease but also performance heavy tasks with ease. The display is beautiful and bright inside and easily visible under the sun also. The camera is one of the best in its category with a quad camera configurable with pixel density upto 64 megapixel. The OneUI from Samsung is intuitive, responsive and convenient to use. Best is that the device is 'Made in India' :) ... a highly recommended phone. The only con is the front camera could have been a 'pin-hole' form factor but then one easily gets used to the 'U-cut' camera form-factor in a matter of a few days.Overall a must have device and highly recommended on all fronts - good camera / display / processing / battery / looks.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  There are several pros for M31. But since it's already covered by other reviewers and YouTube videos, I'll instead point out some not-so-common cons (if at all you can call them cons!)1. The phone does not come with a backcover and it is a fingerprint magnet. So you would need to buy a backcover for aesthetics.2. Not water resistant (is that asking too much?😅)3. It does take a bit of time to get fully charged. But once that's done, it'll easily last for more than a day.4. The earphone slot is at the bottom of the phone. I personally like it on the top. Again, it wouldn't be a bother if you use a Bluetooth earphone/headset. :)5. This might not be the phone for heavy gamers.I haven't found any other problem after a month's usage.Overall, I totally recommend this phone. 😊P.S - I saw some reviews saying the camera quality is poor. I disagree to it as I feel it's really good.\\n\\n\",\n",

Battery is really a monster and can easily survive for at least 35 to 40 hrs..6. RAM and memory management is done pretty well on thisCons1.

       " '\\n\\n  I would say this is a better phone as compare to Redmi note 9 pro max. The reason is very subjective but I will try to answer few of them.The first and foremost is the premium look and feel of this phone which is unlike the Redmi note 9 pro max. The next is the camera quality it’s really outperform as compare to anything which rate me as to offer. Next the overall hamlet screen over here is much better as compare to redmi note 9 pro max.Lastly it all depends on how much you have to spend on a given phone but having a Samsung phone can always give you assurance that it will last long at least an year or two more as compare to any other brand.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  It\\'s been just 3 weeks since i bought this phone.When it comes to midrange models samsung has always been a good choice.Its performance and other features are always been decent.Galaxy M31 has some of the good features too.The First and the best thing about this phone is its display.Its 6.4\" super amoled display is awesome! Touch experience is butter smooth.If you watch lot of movies & videos then this phone is a right choice for you.Bcoz I watch lot of movies so its display quality is really great!It has a massive 6000mah battery which gives you a good battery life. I used to watch offline movies without break for more than 2 hours but the charge only decreases 10%.I think it\\'s really great! But if you are using social media and play games a lot or surfing internet for a long time then it gives you a decent battery life of 1 day or less.This is not for heavy gamers.Pls keep in my mind the charging time is too long.It charges only 34% in 1 hour.So it surely takes 2 and half hours to charge from 0 to100%.Even though they have given an Adaptive Fast Charger it charges slowly.Due to its heavy battery and 8.9mm thickness I thought it would be bulky but surprisingly it doesn\\'t feel heavy or bulky in hand.Thanks to its curvy finish.Cellular call quality is good.It has a single Speaker which is loud and audible.Sound through ear phone also really good.Camera takes decent photos.It has got wide angle and macro too.I have posted some sample shots here .Color Saturation is good.Camera has some more features which I haven\\'t used it yet.Selfie camera is good. When it comes to performance I would say it\\'s not bad at all.I haven\\'t seen any stutter or lag so far.Gaming performance is also good.I am not a fan of PUBG so I haven\\'t installed it.I have Real Racing 2 which played really good without any lag. Some of them has said in their review that the phone has some heating issues but in my experience the phone doesn\\'t heat much while playing games or watching movies or doing any other task.It gets heat while charging but it\\'s normal I think.In this price range you can get lot of other brands with very good spec.But at the end of the day its SAMSUNG.Due to its brand value the pricing is high for this specs.So finally its user\\'s choice to go for what they wish.Overall the phone is good in all aspect.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Beautiful screen with vibrant colours and a wonderful battery life is all I needed and Samsung galaxy delivers it to the dot. No compromises there on the humongous 6000 all day long or should I say all 2 days long battery. And the screen is brilliant with popping colours and eligible under sun.The blacks are deep as it should be on an amoled. Decent gaming is welcome. And the camera is no slouch the quad cam setup comes up with the best of modes. So when you go online with your pictures you don't feel bad at all. Camera has been done rightly. When you can watch Netflix in Full HD there are not a lot of phones providing this option in this segment.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I have ordered this mobile on 20/07/2020 and got delivery on time i.e. 24/07/2020. I have chosen M31, 8 Gb RAM version. Earlier I have used Motorola mobiles (which are good and rugged one) and this is my first Samsung mobile and I think I have made a good decision. Rest time will tell in long term use but first impression is great.So list of Positive points:1. Battery is very of good rating 6000 mAh. i do cycle rides using strava which uses GPS continually and to my surprise after using strava app for nearly 5 and half hour which include clicking photos dropped battery level from 100 % to 75% only. Which I think is very genuine.2. Processor is fast and efficient with almost no lag.3. Camera is definitely a plus point of this mobile. It will not disappoint you.4. RAM size is good as per today’s usage and I have opted for 8 Gb RAM so that in future after updates no issue arises. Other wise 6 Gb is also fine if you are going out of budget. (Here I want to mention that I am not a mobile gamer)5. Super amoled screen by Samsung is just awesome.6. User interface is very good with many good options and it will enhance core android experience. You can uninstall or hide default apps that you do not like on your mobile.7. Internal Memory is enough i.e. 128 Gb over that you get a dedicated micro SD card slot so that is impressive.8. Finger print sensor works very fast and efficiently.Now coming to negative points from my point of view1. Volume of loud speaker is bit less. If finger or something else comes over speaker it reduces volume drastically.One neutral point is that it comes with a battery charger of 15 watts only which is bit low for 6000 mAh battery but at same time very fast charging is not good for life of battery. May be Samsung engineers did what is best for their product.Final words \"It’s a good mid range mobile by Samsung with impressive performance”\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  DISLIKES:I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product  Defects:No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:-headphone audioJack not working-caller audio receiver not working-speaker not workingVideos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2× speed.Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.LIKES:Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.WHO can Buy:-Camera is priority-Wants some bigger battery-day to day regular usage-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wiselyPHONE WONT' SATISFY:-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.-onscreen finger print sensor-A51Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.For this price,this is a real mega monster.REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer's😁\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is my 3rd phone in Galaxy series. Galaxy series from Samsung is widely known for great phones with great features, but this one M31, is great even from Budget point of view. I did purchase on First Day First Show, when this was launched. Reason is number of reviews I had read on YouTube. Almost 20+ reviews I checked. I also read number of issues on Samsung forum / various blogs/forum etc. Every piece of information convinced, this is the best phone in this budget. Extreme value for Money.My smartphone journey has been quiet diverse in terms of various companies, so I am able to compare / differentiate various features, with hands on experience.From Year 2012 : Samsung Galaxy S2 > HTC Incredible 2 > HTC Rhyme > Samsung Galaxy Note 2 > LG G Vista > LG G6 > Redmi Note 3 > LG Q6 > Redmi Pro 6 > Samsung M31 : To year 2020.Following is my experience with M31, after a month of usage.Good: (for M31)- Android 10! Great looking version & beautifully customized by Samsung. Even in 10th edition, Samsung was fast to roll out update.- Mammoth display, my kids can actually use it properly for school online classes, as screen is sufficient when viewed from near distance.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 mAh battery is NEED of the times, with so much dependence on online activities. I use it full day + almost half of the time on HOT spot. Still, battery works for a 1.5 to 2 days. Charging is very fast, but not ultra fast. 30 min can increase around 50% battery.- Both the SIM support 4G (that’s plus), as we can practically use 2 JIO SIM for almost double the data, without any switchover.- Separate SD Card (up to 512 GB), actually is a great feature. Existing memory of 128 GB is sufficient as of now & SD cards (high capacity) are not cheap as such. So, Samsung did a right thing to provide enough memory from beginning.- Mobile speakers is good for normal music (less bass) & conference call. You actually feel part of the room, when conference call over speaker.- Camera is really good. So many features re there & I am yet to fully know them, as my basic usage is not for photography, but my children makes great video from this phone.- Figure-print sensor response is good, but when finger is moist due to sweat / water, it doesn’t response. That’s problem with all the phone, but the moment you wipe your finger, you are good to go. Response time is ultra fast.- Thanks Amazon for delivering within 3 days, even in partial lock down conditions.Not So Good: (for M31)- Not thin & light. Additionally, I have put up a sturdy cover + glass, so weight increased heavily. After few days you get used to it.- Doesn’t come with Samsung Security feature (like other galaxy series premium phone). However, Samsung does offer S-Secure app to lock certain apps with finger scan.- To many Samsung related apps (like global goal etc) & many of them are still to be known what it does. But Samsung can reduce such apps to save memory. You can disable few of them.- SMS can’t be deleted with a swipe (like in case of redmi),that’s important as many of the OTP/temporary messages should be deleted to reduce clutter.- Mobile torch can’t be switched of with a phone power button. This is a required feature, instead of going to notification & switch off torch.-- No light sensor in front, as it helps to avoid call going in hold during conversation. I read on Samsung forum, that front camera is used, so we have to hold phone in particular normal angle, that will ensure that call doesn’t get disturbed. Now, little used to it.- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. Apps run like butter & it never gives a message of storage space running out, in spite of heavy storage.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.If you are looking for a sub 20k feature rich phone, go for M31/Samsung. As it is far batter than any other Chinese options available, which are good in flashy advertisement, but in long run performance, they can’t match Samsung. I have been user of\\n\\n\",\n",

Another interesting feature is a macro camera.. the wide angle camera is very good too. The basic camera has excellent low light capability and gives a bright image (is it the screen or the camera?).. in short the camera(s) perform much better than expected.And the phone feels solid.The battery again is just great. What's the point having lots of features and not being able to use them? The battery makes them available and reliable. I think this is the first smartphone around with acceptable battery life. For a 15K phone (introductory price), this is real good! Great job Samsung. And nice delivery Amazon, I received it the day before the lock down!\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I had a horrible experience after buying Samsung M31 immediately after it's launch. The screen display got non-functional just in three months of usage. My display got blacked out just in two minutes while I was watching video. Screen went completely black as if it's switched off. The mobile didn't have any physical damage and mishandling. There was not a single game installed and I used the mobile during lockdown just for calling and and watching videos. When I contacted the Samsung service center they called it's liquid damage called bleeding and it comes under physical damage and therefore I will have to bear the repairing charges of display change which is 5000 rs. I am really disappointed with the service and company policy where the consumer is exploited for non-functioning of mobile even though it happened on its own. Buying such an expensive mobile which doesn't work for few months is really not acceptable and company should take a note of that and act accordingly in favour of the consumer. Substandard products are being made and delivered to the customer and charged in the name of policy terms and conditions.\\n\\n\",\n",

It is truly crazy!I have been using this phone for a little over a week now, and I am just in love with everything it has to offer.The camera quality is just amazing, people just need to make sure that they set the default output of the pics at 64 Mp as the phone naturally clicks pics at 16 Mp mode to save space.I love that my phone is add free (which is such a relief!) And all the other features are just so fun to use!This phone is seriously a SNATCH at the price Samsung has introduced it.

Its colours are not that real and it doesnt feel that good to take 64mp photo. Its battery is good but at the first charge it took ages for me to get 100 percent. But after that it got quicker i.e it got to its original speed of charge. Software and its ui looks premium and good. There is a little lag while you fast open recent apps ( You can see it rarely, but for some apps u see it for sure). But overall its good. You will see some features which are that useful to you but when you see it will feel good. I think samsung does it because it wants yo make us feel luxury( but luxury in the sense not that useful but it is there) and honestly it feels good to have it. You will feel it good, simple, elegant to have it in your hand.\\n\\n',\n",

Not expected from at least Samsung.. earlier I had used Le 2, Lenovo, micromax, Infinix, realme, xiomi and currently I am using Honor and IPhone 7.. every experience was a charm but this time, it’s very disappointing..Coming to Samsung M31, purchased it a month ago.. 7 days back the mobile started behaving abnormally.. it’s touch stopped working frequently and at times, the mobile started operating and clicking on different parts of the screen on its own..I went to Samsung service Center and they told that it might be software problem and so they went for a software reinstallation.. I got the mobile after that and it started working fine, but again the next day, the same problem arised..Now they are telling that it might be the problem of the motherboard and I have to wait for few days,,This is pathetic..

Screen - The Display is superb to say the least. sAMOLED display makes watching videos a delight!2. Camera - Few modes and video shooting in both rear and front camera is great. The enhancements dont make the photos look artificial which is great! However, can improve on the 64 MP mode - probably on OTA update can fix it.3. Battery - I have used phones with 5000 mAH battery for the last 2-3 years from Asus (Max series) - If I would rank that 5/5 because they would easily last 1.5 days without charge, this would be 4 +0.5 /5 ( 0.5 for fast charging, even if battery drains out fast). A full charge can last the day.  This is when I have medium to heavy usage of phone without gaming.4. Processing - Very smooth for 6GB, no lags whatsover!5. Some modes and features -•Dolby Atmos Sound mode for headsets is amazing!• Game mode has lots of features related to screen like screen recording, etc.• Fingerprint scanner is super fast too. Haven't tried the face unlock so can't comment on that.Overall, would suggest that if you want to couple the brand trust along with good features - definitely go for M31 !\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Good phone I had ever seenReviewed on samsung.comWell, the Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in blue, the first thing I did was put the case that I had already prepared. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to falling asleep playing on my mobile and using it, and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 64GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 64GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Battary Life:I have bought this phone for long battery and good Camera, however this phone disappointed me in both the cases.1.Battary Life: I am using this phone since 11th August 2020 and now it's 15 days.Phones battary got drained in just 04-05 hours of average active screen usage.This performance is worst than 3000 battery.2.Charging : even after 4:30 hrs of charging phone is not fully charged with given adaptor.This is one of the worst phone battery ever seen.I am getting frustrated because of this.II. CAMERA:So called 64mp camera, quality of camera is seems to be like 32mp camera and is not that much good.III.The worst part is, I have recommended this phone & he bought this phone and facing the same problemKindly replace the phone on immediate basis.We don't want to continue  with this kind of phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I\\'m writing this review after using the phone for a month, and here\\'s the detailed review of my experience using the phone.• BEST PARTS1) SCREEN: Straight up the most attractive part of the phone. The sAMOLED display is crisp, color accurate and legible even in the hardest of lights. And the Always-On Display is a bliss, with customisable clock faces and even options to place own photos. Since the display is AMOLED, this doesn\\'t cause much battery drain (about 1-2% more drain when keeping it \"Always On\" as compared to off). And the bezels are not noticeable much, and the screen is super smooth. The refresh rate is still 60Hz, but then it\\'s not geared towards gaming. 9/102) BATTERY LIFE: Absolutely unbelievable! The 6000 mAh battery is no joke and it delivers. I use my phone heavily (~10hr screen on time, with video calls, gaming and instagram scrolling) and still the battery lasts me a day and a half. Charging is also good, it takes almost 2.5 hours to get it from ~20% to 100%. 10/103) PERFORMANCE: The 6/64 variant caters to my needs perfectly. There is always more than 2 GB of RAM free, even when there\\'s 4-5 background apps open. Sometimes I minimise my game to respond to a notification, and then forget about it; and when I open it after 6 hours it\\'s still there in the memory. Phenomenal!The processor, now. Before buying the phone, I read a lot of reviews as I was skeptical about the processor. Snapdragon 730G is better, they said. But to be honest, I really don\\'t see the difference. This phone has never once lagged in my one month of using it. It is snappy and DOESN\\'T HEAT UP.  10/104) SOFTWARE: As soon as I started up the phone, I opened up the app drawer and removed all the apps that could be removed, and then disabled some I didn\\'t need and couldn\\'t be uninstalled (Samsung\\'s mostly), so that\\'s GREAT. Also, I ensured I disabled notifications whenever any spammy notifications arrived, and within two days my phone was ABSOLUTELY bloat-free.Samsung\\'s OneUI is beautiful. I have no other words for it. The dark mode goes well with the sAMOLED display, and is absolutely great to work with. I\\'d always been a fan of stock Android and Pixel, but OneUI changed me. 10/105) CAMERA QUALITY: I\\'m not an enthusiastic photographer, but as far as day-to-day photography is concerned, it is magnificent and highly detailed. You need to tweak settings in the Camera app to suit your taste and also set the resolution (64MP photos are 3:4 aspect ratio, but I prefer Full screen, for example). I also got GCam installed and that\\'s added benefit, if you care. The wide angle lens is nice! There\\'s barrell distortion at the edges but you get an option to automatically correct it in the settings. Macro camera is able to pick up details easily and really close to the subject.Front camera is equally good, able to capture details nicely. There\\'s also a wide angle mode for the front camera, though it\\'s just software and there isn\\'t an actual wide angle camera at the front. 9/10 for both!• NOT-SO-GOOD PARTS1) The speaker quality is not breathtaking. It does the job and is reasonably loud, but I prefer headphones or else my Echo Dot for audio, so it doesn\\'t matter.2) The back surface is \"glasstic\" and smudges easily. Get yourself a cover and you\\'re good to go.3) Fingerprint sensor is FAST but use it once with sweaty fingers and it can\\'t detect anymore unless you clean it.So, there you have it. If you want a no-nonsense phone with great battery, screen and camera, with NO ads (read: Xiaomi, Realme) and NO bloatware and a BEAUTIFUL UI, look no further. The Galaxy M31 is THE phone to go for.P.S. call quality and network is also flawless. I use airtel.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)Pros1. Great phone with 128 GB storage and 6 GB RAM at this price.  Definitely great  value for money.2. Total 5 cameras make it a great photography experience. (wide angle + depth + macro for close ups.3. 6000 mAh Battery lasts for more than 24 hr with moderate use. Charging is fast. Takes 2 hr to charge from  20 % to 100%.4. Switch over to USB type C cable which is going to be the future universal cable across all devices of all companies.Cons1. 128 GB memory is great but within a month it has started getting reduced with software updates. It is the same game that the mobile companies have been playing with the customers. One has to discard the phone while it is still working well because of depleting memory. Let me see how long I am able to use this phone despite my settings  to store most of the things in the SD card.2. Highest sound volume is also very unsatisfactory. In fact, the worst sound volume among all phones that I have used earlier including three different models of Samsung Galaxy.3. The positioning of cameras on margin is problematic because we are used to camera lenses positioned around the mid-line of devices. It is difficult to aim the camera with a side-aligned Macro lens.4. Default Font type and size is very small. Option of Samsung Font is provided and it has better readability.  But even after switching to Samsung font and increasing the font size through display settings it works on some websites but not on many others where the font remains small.5. The phone heats up while charging . I never experienced this heating while charging with any of my earlier Samsung phones..6. The charger has a USB Type C cable. Therefore, you have to make sure that you carry your new cable with you all the time on the go till it becomes the normal charging cable like the present Type B cables found in each home and office.7. Very difficult to take screenshots with M31 because the volume control and the on-off switch are on the same side adjacent to each other.8. Samsung has saved some money by not including  ear phones in the phone package.  Earphone  doesn't cost much but a new earphone with a new phone gives good feeling to customers. This was not expected from the cell phone giant like Samsung.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Seller must be banned... I ordered this handset twice.... First time it was ON inside the package.... I returned the parcel that time..... Then ordered again.... Today after opening the handset everything was looking good, but when open Sim slot it was very tight from inside.... When it ejected finally, the Sim slot was tampered... I think it's returned and repackaged handset sold by the seller.... So the seller must be kicked out from Amazon Prime...\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Its battery life is really amazing. I charged this phone from 0 to 100 in 160 mins. If you are heavy social media user you can use continously 10hrs with one full charge.Pros:Good wide angle cameraBest selfieGreat features like app timer and you can see how much you spended time in each day.It can be suitable fir even 13 years child too with parental control.Good display qualityFast responding with no hangsAll rounder.It owned its samsung exynos 9116 soc processer. Which prevent from loss of performance when heatingCons:Dust on phone will easily visibleDesign is lightly oldSamsung still remains the launcher no improvement in launcher.Charging time is little slow when compared to redmi latest phones\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Overall Good. 6GB RAM provides smooth operating of Phone along with Android 10 and One UI 2.0. Though fast charging feature is provided in this model, feels like its charging at normal speed and samsung needs to check with this. As I also own a Samsung galaxy M40 whose charging is really fast as compared to M31.Only drawback is that can't get proper sized tempered glass for this mobile. Hope Samsung will try to provide Proper accessories for any new Model they launch.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Great phone in all aspects at a pocket friendly price point. i was using several expensive brands earlier and i needed another phone for some generic use at home. i was looking for a good balance of quality, brand, performance and a decent price point. this samsung galaxy M31 fits that bill perfectly. i have been using this for several months now and i am extremely happy with it's performance. speed and responsiveness are great. camera quality is comparable to several expensive phones that i have at home. finger print sensor is a great relief and makes it highly usable. display quality, like all samsung devices is really superior. light weight on the pocket both in terms of it's real weight and also from the price perspective :-) Strongly recommend to budget conscious folks..\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Phone built quality is good. It's a very rigid phone. I have already dropped it thrice but thank God phone is working normal till now.Camera quality is AWESOME. It is best in this price range. But camera is not so quick. Phone gives lag while using camera.Battery life is normal if we see a 6000 MAh battery. My usage is mostly internet and I use Bluetooth connection also. I get around 8 to 10 hours of battery life when Bluetooth and location is on.Finger print sensor is working fine. But I think it could be a faster one.Phone is not so quick while using multiple windows. It gives lag.Overall I am fully satisfied with the phone performance. Highly recommended if you are searching a new phone in this price range. GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHT.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Best Mobile from Samsung I Purchased 2 handset from Amazon, In Just Rs:17499/ You get A Samsung Mobile with 128 GB of Internal Storage, 6GB RAM & 6.4 Inch Super Amoled Screen.Best part of it Mega Moster 6000 Mah Battery first from any Mobile Co.You can buy this Mobile without second thaught. I m enjoying 3 day of Battery life on moderate use.Thank Brand Samsung n Amazon quickly delivered to me within 12 hours.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I've got the 6GB+128GB variant and thanks to early access and Prime Delivery experience....Pro:1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.7. Price.Cons:1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protection🙂.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  with plenty of very good and expert reviews available for Samsung M31 for its deserving features and quality, I would like to share my experience as a user with vision impairment using screen-reader and Text-to-speech:1. Samsung mM31 features Samsung's own built-in screen reader 'voice assistant', hence Android Accessibility Suite doesn't come built-in. One needs to download it from playstore if the need be.2. Samsung's 'Voice Assistant' is an efficient screen-reader in itself, but those used to Talkback will find it less suitable in terms of gestures and other features.3. The camera is surprisingly accessible with the screen-reader telling you if face(s) get focused. I could click not-so-bad pictures as a totally blind person!4. Samsung's UI and in-built applications offer smooth and faster navigation while using screen-reader. Most of the buttons in Samsung's apps are labeled and hence accessible.5. Attending calls is most convenient with the volume-up button doing the job. Live caption is also another fantastic feature that will be useful for the hearing impaired people.6. There could have been an option to wake the Google Assistant using power button since 'Okay Google' comment is not all that convenient in travel and noisy places.Overall, Samsung M31 is a very good choice in this budget for the visually impaired / blind users too.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Pretty heavy phone to handle.great response time from one window to another, excellent refresh rate on the screen.Didn’t like was too much heating on the phone. May becoz of the 6000 mah battery at the back but it’s ok as most of phone do heat up.Battery life is something on how the person uses it, it’s recommended that use the phone till it indicates it needs to be charged say 15% or even 5%. And then charge the phone back again. To have healthy battery life.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  On the next day of release i.e 6.3.2020 ,  I purchased Samsung M31 , as I was very impressed with M20.Samsung the \" master in creating mobiles \" in the intrest of public and to their taste.  My order was honoured and sent the phone within 3days.Now Iam enjoying the great phone suitable to my purse.No heating in playing and recording videos.Thrillig sound output ..What more I need..I recommend to my friends to own a beautiful phone..\\n\\n',\n",

Easily lasts for 2 days.Awesome camera. The images captured are having enhanced colors that are very attractive. Better result in low light compared to my other 22k phone. Memory management, even high resolution images are of ambient size. Front camera result is really awesome.Processor. Its good and I did not find any lag since I bought the phone.Weight management and balanced body.Conc.Notch display and back mounted fingerprint scanner. Other phones come with punch hole display and in-screen or side mounted scanner. But the price is higher and also in many display is ips lcd and not super amoled. So its the preference by which you should decide.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  First of all I received the phone I was incredibly happyIt says it has 6000amper but I found it was not up to the expectationsIt takes around 3:30 hr to charge completely while it should only take approx 2:30 hr,even battery drains out quickly within 8-9hours on WiFi the battery turns from 100% to 17%-this is how 6000mah works????? ofcourse not!!!!It heats up a lot while charging like about to burstFor me it was a terrible experience ,I will not recommend anyone to purchase Samsung m31 , Samsung is a brilliant industry which makes brilliant and durable products but its only applicable to their high rated phones(above 60000rs)In the case of m31 they have too many compromises which reduces the battery efficiency,camera quality and all and you not need to waste even 17499rs for that you can get these lower performance even in the budget😉 of 6000rs,for me it's a high rated product with low I mean very low performanceBetter to by any other brand products in place of using this phone by Samsung!!!!!!!Anyways Samsung is the brilliant company but here they are making compromises in low priced productsSo same your time and money both,😁😁😁😁What's inside the box-adaptor with able,phone,warranty papers,pin and that's it😵😂And now I don't want the product coz for me even 17499rs matters alot\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  1. I'm writing this review after 120 days of usage, using the 6GB Ram /128GB version.2. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon - within 72hr delivery.(b) The phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(c) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(d) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo, realms and Mi. Works like a flash.(e) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(f) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. Front camera is average.(g) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(h) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking approx 3hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.(c) Finger touch has less sensitivity.5. Otherwise I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Camera is awesome, you just need to know how to use it in the best way.Fingerprint, face unlock are pretty fast.Battery lasts for 1.5 days for person like me who listens to music, plays games but less often, talks over skype and click photos every now and then.I love this phone and I appreciate myself for choosing it over realme 6 and other such Chinese phones.Good job Samsung 💯🤟\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Very best product at this range. Battery and camera is awesome. Network connectivity is not as strong as M30 but it could be better with some updates.

       " \"\\n\\n  Previously, I was using Samsung A6+ which accidentally got broken so needed one phone too as I can't get it to repair as it was during the lockdown. So, I was looking to buy this phone looking at its features, and after hearing that it will even be available in 8gb RAM and also its price. But, when I checked this phone on Amazon and Samsung website firstly it was not on stock. So, then I waited for a few days to get it. Later on, as soon as it was on stock I purchased it, and also it was my first experience to purchase a smartphone online. I received it on time and it's just a perfect phone as per my usage. I would also prefer it to everyone who wants a smartphone with good storage capacity, battery, camera, and performance then it is definitely the one.Thank you Amazon for timely and undamaged delivery and also for making it available during lockdown too.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  What I like about the phone is that the touch is smooth, the back camera is good but i honestly expected better considering that is its usp. The 2nd day of using the phone my instagram stopped working and was force closing every single time and the whole phone would freeze and not work for 30secs. The battery life is surprisingly not good. It takes a long time to charge since its 6000 mah battery but drains completely in a day. The face unlock is not that fast. The camera is noisy at night and the wide angle sides gets distorted. Even the front camera is not that good at low light. Also absolutely hate that Samsung has so many pre installed app which cluster the phone and is of absolute no use.Overall an okay phone, for me i expected better at 17k.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  First of all after 1 month of using m31, i am now going to post a review about it.. so let's start with the followingScreen-first of all if you are a movie lover or watch movies mostly on mobile then its samoled has no comparison and is best in all cotegories.Battery- optimization of battery is not so good, but yeah you can play pubg continuous for almost 7-8 hrs which is quite impressive.. now you can think of urself how good is its batteryProcessor-its processor is quite good, but but but optimization of it is worst, 9611 is quite gud, if it may be optimized well..with the software and games..You can get fps around 35-55 in pubg smooth +extremeBody-body is made of plastic, and no frame but yaa with a cover it look amazing🖤Weight- with a massive 6000mah battery weight of the phone is well managed not so heavy, not so light, normal normal but yaa more than normal devicesLast but not the leastAdvice-download Package disabler pro and disable all bloatware.. it will make your device more smooth...I guess in the next update they will optimize the processor and fix there services bugs..Stay safe❤\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Nice phone with almost all advanced features.Pros:-1. Display is FHD and full marks to it.2. Sound quality is ok.3. Android 10 is handy.4. Full marks ro 64MP quad camera.Cons:-1. Battery is never felt like 6000mah. Rather it performs like 4500mah.2.while receiving the call the panel sensitivity is poor.Overall value for money. Must buy.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Pointwise Review after 15 day usage:Buid quality: Basic build quality with plastic uni-body, not that impressive but not that bad. Looks just fine. Back panel attracts lots of finger impressions.Screen: must be the best displays that samsung is providing in M series within this price range or comparable to even flagships.Rear camera: it has 4 rear camera sensors, here is what i felt about these:-Main 64MP sensor: probably the best in this price range, performs phenomenonal in day light conditions. However, in low light conditions you start to feel that it's a lower mid rnge phone, though all phone in this price segment struggle in low light conditions.Macro sensor: it fine, not bad. However, i had more expections with it.Wide angle sensor: pathetic qualityDepth sensor: must be the worst, very poor edge detection.Front camera: inclined towards good camera category, it can be improved.Processor: no problem in normal usage, but not recommended for those who want to play heavy games on it.Ram management: initially more than 3gb memory was always in use without software or even sim. But after tweeking the optimization settings and removing bloatware, it performing better. No complaintMemory: it's fast, no complaintBattery: it's really a monster. With normal usage of calling, camera, messaging you can easily get 2 days of battery life. It can be easily extended to even 4 days if you use very less.Charging: Though samsung claims fast charging, it's not. 15W charger doesnt seems to be really providing 15W power. Theoretically, it should charge 6000mAh battery in 2 hours, but it takes 3-3.5 hours for full charging. Not that impressive.Speaker output: it's fine, not that laud but not that low.Sound quality in earphones: Good quality output, no complaintFingerprint and face unlock: no complaintCons:1. Slow charging speed2. Very poor wide angle camera3. Poor edge detection in depth camera sensor4. One serious problem that others also faced: randomly 2 times it got rebooted itself and stuck on boot screen for 20 minutes. I have to see if it persists.Edit: after july OTA update battery performance reduced significantly.Edit: after 1.5month of usage; working fine. Rebooting problem didnt happen again after OTA update. Battery performance was better before the update. However, still it's not bad. One need to tweek app settings to optimise the juice suckling of the apps.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  The phone is really good for this budget, I was looking for a secondary phone since a long time and after using it , I will never use the term secondary with this. It's a amazing phone to use , I have been using it since 3 weeks.It takes time to charge but the battery lasts for 2 days (6000 mh).Picture quality is more than enough 64 mega pixel and 32 selfie shooter gives you perfect experience of photography.Face unlocking is a bit slow but good enough.Finger print reader is nice.Over all looks is 9.5 out of 10Great phone Samsung.Got the delivery of the phone in just 2 days , much appreciated . Amazon 👍\\n\\n\",\n",

With 6gb ram, this mobile dose all job smoothly.6000mah battery is really good offer. Earlier 'Battery backup' was a big issue for me due to continuous travel for my sales job.  Now, I can happily use GPS maps with worring about battery drain issue during work hrs.This is worth a buy. I charge daily night, but my observation (not tested) says, battery definitely last 1&half day with normal use.\\n\\n\",\n",

Then I am telling you my experience with this phone.In daily usases this phone is absolutely fine in this price segment. Only one thing is that you can play PUBG on recommended settings  not on the high settings for long time. Otherwise there is no any issue in this phone. Only one thing I want to say that this phone is the best.Love it. Display is absolutely fine.Go for it.\\n\\n',\n",

But this time I want to experience Samsung phone & I found Amazing Phone Samsung Galaxy M31 phone as compared to all Mi brand phones. I am excited with following reasons to use this phone:- 6000 mah battery, for 2 days not need to charge even using for games and zoom meeting- 4 rear camara. I got amazing results even in Night also. Front camera results was also amazing.- 6GB RAM. So phone is not hang even so many applications are running on background.- 128 GB ROM. Not need to use memory card.- Space black colour. Amazing sexy looking- Function of taking selfy using our hand palm.- Font is also good.- Brightness is great even in sun light.- Bluelight filter can help to reduce stress of eyes to use phone in nightI strongly recommend to buy this phone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  After using one month ..These are good things I noticed..1. touch is good 2. Battery is good.. 3.screen is perfect .  Now comes to bad points..1.some time screen got blackout automatically not expected this.. 2. in simple application it get hang some time(i am not pubg player dont know what they are racing).  3. Camera is okk okk i hv vivo with same specifications ..As it is camera phone still it lags with vivo...\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Speed of mobile is Good, no hanging, smooth gaming. For me Camera not up to the mark...as I earlier used Samsung note5 and 8mp of note5 is much better then this 64mp. Samoled is great. Finishing of the product is so not good....alignment of fitting lacks perfection. Camera holes alignment or side edge you can see poor craftsmanship.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I felt myself very bad for switching  back to Samsung. It is having all good quality as they mention in specifications. But I can't imagine  why it is generating that much of heat at upper half part of mobile. Very scary even to touch. Hope it will be solved in future with some system upgradation. Waiting for the same- Charan\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  OCEAN BLUE, 6+128The product was delivered to me on 8th March 2020,so i am reviewing it after 3 months.1. Camera QualityThe quad camera is awesome, even some shots can be compared from cinematic shots you can zoom the pic upto extreme extend.Front camera is 32MP and selfies are as good as the pics taken from rear camera Sometimes even better.Overall camera is excellent .2. DISPLAYWith the phone equipped with superamoled along with infinity display you can watch some videos on YouTube even on 240p and it gives the feel of 360p quality.Needless to say about HD video their views are crystal clear.Although the display is protected by Coring Gorilla 3 but i would suggest the buyers to apply screengaurd the quality of videos or the touchscreen functions would not be affected i can assure you for that.3. BATTERY LIFEThe most demanding feature in any cellphone.For normal usage like movies, calls, videos calls, music the battery would lasts upto almost 2days.On the otherhand if you are a heavy gamer like PUBG or CALL OF DUTY, then also you can play these games 8-10hours continuously.I have played PUBG on M31 8 hours continuously with 15% battery remaining afterwards.4. GAMEPLAYPUBG never lagsWhenever i am playing with my squad they say the game is lagging as some squad or any enemy is approaching but i never ever experienced any type of lagging during gameplay except the network error problem or sometimes when internet is not  working properly.Otherwise, if you are a pro player of PUBG you can reach CONQUERER rank with this phone.5. RAM & ROMThe buyer will get almost 110gb of user space as their some pre-installed and system apps.With 6gb RAM you are all set for smooth and fast gameplay and multifunction.6. FINGERPRINT READERYou can add more than one fingerprint.Beside that the sensor is at the back side so at times you can feel that the sensor should have been on screen otherwise the sensor responds quickly to the fingerprint.Overall it's best phone in the market below 20000.The only missing quality was 8gb ram according to my opinion but on 29th May 2020 8gb RAM variant was also been launched.The one and only drawback with this cellphone is its charging time as the battery capacity is 6000mAh but the charger is of 15W only so it takes 3hours to charge the battery 100%.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it\\'s M series of smartphones.Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.Rating: 5 of 5.Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.Rating: 5 of 5Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it\\'s awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that\\'s normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it\\'s ok at this price point.Rating: 5 of 5Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.Sound: 4 of 5Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can\\'t be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.Rating: 4 of 5.Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word \"Excellent\". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.Rating: 5 of 5Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.Rating: 5/5Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  *Looks_Premium*Samsung has gone with glasstic for the back of the phone — plastic that looks and feels like glass — which is smart, because it gives the phone a premium finish while keeping the weight low. And weight could have been a problem given that Samsung shoved a monster 6,000 mAh battery into this thing.And don\\'t let the \"glass\" in “glasstic” fool you, it’s still plastic and still prone to scratches, and it’s glossy, making the phone slippery to hold, especially for someone as butterfingered as I am. On the bright side, the phone doesn’t look cheap, unlike its predecessor.Battery Life- An Absolute BeastPacking a whopping 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M31 has managed to reach roughly the end of two days on a single charge, despite being connected to Wi-Fi for the majority of that time, with Bluetooth on and multiple wearables and a pair of wireless earbuds connected for good measure. That’s on top of the heavy use activities I mentioned previously. Simply put, you’d have to be a serious procrastinator to even think about draining the battery completely in a single day.Samsung Galaxy M31 – 4The Galaxy M31 proves that having a multi-day battery life doesn’t cost the Earth, and if you were planning on using the M31 as your main media device of choice, this unbelievable battery life paired with the phone’s AMOLED screen makes for a match-made in heaven. You could binge content for hours on this thing.The only letdown is the supposed inclusion of 15w fast charging, which I beg to differ. When hooked up to a power outlet, it took just over two hours to reach full charge from 8%. If charging your phone overnight is part of your routine then you’ll never have an issue here, but needing a quick top up before you leave your home is just out of the question.Camera Quality- Good but not BestGood quad rear camera setup - 64MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensorShots taken with the primary camera during daylight are quite satisfactory, images are detailed, especially the 64MP shots, and they showcase good dynamic rangeThe ultra-wide sensor, like on any budget phone, is a good addition - it takes social media-worthy images in great lighting conditions (in low-light, the quality dips and pictures look grainy and noisy, wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges)Photos taken in low-light looks good - switching to Night mode helps reduce grain in the output and further improves image qualityLive Focus shots are quite impeccable and the camera app does give you the option to set the level of blur before taking a shot - edge detection is very good and the Galaxy M31 does a good job of separating the subject from the backgroundThe macro camera takes decent shots outdoors (though, the quality dips when indoors and the output is restricted to 5MP in resolution)The 32MP selfie camera is quite good and takes detailed selfies (though, in low light, the quality goes down a notch and results are grainy)Overall, the cameras on the M31 are good for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title crowned to the POCO X2)Overall Verdict:Samsung\\'s Galaxy M31 delivers the promise of long-lasting battery life and one of the best in its class in the market. In the camera department too has improved a lot over the predecessor.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Got this after my long stint with the Lenovo Zuk Z2 plus. Jumping from a Snapdragon (820) to an Exynos was difficult, but had no other choice. After a lot of searches and collating data and feedbacks, went for the Galaxy M31 (6+128). Was planning for an 8gb model but was not sure how good Exynos 9611 would handle tasks, so went with one level down. To be honest this phone does the job very good and more than what is expected. Back is a finer print magnet and the open camera is prone to damage unless a good back cover is put on. App loading time is a bit high. Fingerprint and face unlock is fast though the face unlock takes a longer time sometimes. I tested face unlock in dark environment and worked good as the brightness fills up your face from the device to capture the face. Similarly works for night time low light selfies. Games run smooth with minor frame drops at high settings otherwise you wouldn't find any (I am not a gamer though tried quite a few for sometime off in the lockdown). Has a specific game booster mode. There's no lag on the phone unless you install multiple apps as in my case. I have a usage of lot of apps at all times on my phone (32 as of now including the preinstalled ones). You'd only find lags while opening the app drawer beacause the phone is unable to handle so many apps installed. If you are not into keeping many apps on your device this is the perfect phone for you. Camera quality is good. Has a night mode which captures good pictures in low light. But selfies in low light are not good. This phone did not disappoint me (only if I have lesser apps). Preinstalled apps are removable. Battery backup is very good and with a fast charger is power packed. Faster fast charger would have been more helpful for this battery though. Liked it but would be happier only Samsung could have shortened or removed the notch with a punch hole as in the M31s. Samsung does not provide SD processor and Amoled screen together and they have been running the same old 9611 processor of theirs on all recent (previous ) and new phones as well from the A & M series. It's time Samsung thinks about it. Just not to increase the price of a phone with few new features and same old processor won't do good. Overall a good phone to go for. A tough competitor with other Chinese counterparts. You can also checkout the M21 which only has a difference of camera (48mp) if you want to save some bucks. Other features mostly remain the same.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Fingerprint reader works quite well but not so amazing as my old redmi note4 because it only works if your finger is completely moisture and dust free. Camera quality is amazing, works well even in low light. Even though I expected a little bit more battery life (I am using always on screen and maximum cpu usage) it is pretty good. Screen quality is good and I have to say that even for an above average hand sized person like me, it is difficult to use this handset in a single hand (you cannot access the notification bar while using a single hand). The lenght of the phone is a bit over sized i guess. Talking about other physical attributes, it is a bit over weighted because of the 6000mAh monster of a battery it is packing. There are a lot more advanced features encorporated in this handset and most of them are very much user friendly.  I have been using this phone for 2 months now and honestly speaking I have encountered hanging 2 times. But both of the times it was the application that wasn't resposding. First time I had tried to close the application and it took some time to respond to it. I know its a bit harsh to criticize such a phone that provides so much for a budget price but I thought it would be better to give an honest experience here because for buyers like me every penny is hard earned!Thanks.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  6 MONTH REVIEW:I came to this phone after using the S7 for 3 years and finally decided to move on to a bigger screen and also the battery on the S7 had seriously degraded to a point where I had to recharge it twice a day.So one of my major draw for this phone was the 6000 mAh battery sadly that was the most disappointing part of the phone. The phone was advertised as having a 2 day battery but with my primary usage of watching videos it hardly lasts an entire day.It does last 2 days on light usage though which comes handy when traveling. I have disabled fast charging to allow my battery to last longer but even in cable charging mode the phone charges quite fast which is good.It also used to hang and restart abruptly quite often initially but after multiple updates it seems to have stabilized.The fingerprint reader requires multiple tries to work as it seems to attract smudges which inhibit it's performance.The Camera was one of the prime reasons to buy the phone and it's perhaps the best feature of this device. I usually use the 64mp feature for highest quality which it delivers.Overall for the price the phone is alright but hopefully Samsung can improve the battery life through some future updates.\\n\\n\",\n",

And its outstanding camera quality will impress you to the brim.Last but not least, Brand Value, Samsung always has a reasonable resale value.Cons:Speaker output is low. If you are a type of person who doesn't like earphones, and loves to hear songs on speaker, this product might not impress you.Exynos 9611, though is a decent processor equivalent to Snapdragon 712, but is unsuitable for hardcore gamers. In low graphics, you can observe playable fps.Charging time is approximately 180-190 minutes from 0-100. Fast charging needs improvement.Samsung could have provided an earphone, unfortunately, there's none.Summary:This is a value for money smartphone which focus is to grab attention of movies and TV show audience. If you go for it, one thing you'll definitely not have is regret.\\n\\n\",\n",

And you can set settings of the display to natural colour.Software: As far as the Samsung's own UI is concern, I think it's intuitive, lacks some crazy fastness of AOSP or android one projects — but with the phone one is paying for the software as well. And might as well, use these OEMs rather than running something plain. It's stable so far and running great. Fingerprint is pretty fast, as fast as my other device poco F1Battery line is absolutely wonderful, it takes almost 3 hours I think to be fully charged, with standard usage it gives me screentime of around 36 hours sometimes 24, while playing PUBG or Call of duty.Camera quality: Well, I only have one word, impressive. Camera on this phone is social butterfly's or some serious smartphone photography, videography — although no video stabilisation in 4k mode.Some things to look out for: Phone body catches smudges easily, so get a cover if you are serious about it.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  After purchasing this device I'm writing my opinion for Samsung Galaxy m31. Screen resolution absolutely stunning at first sight you will fall in love with it. About system presentation Samsung have really worked great on it to make it much better compared to its previous devices available in the market.Camera performance is some what not as per the expectations compared to the other devices with 64 mega pix.camera available in the market. Performance of the camera in low light is not that much good.Last but not the least regarding performance guys I'm still thinking after creating such a beautiful device why samsung have kept 1 lacuna i.e. processor chip set. Other brands are providing Snapdragon chip set which is much more powerful at this price segments while Samsung is lacking that which is some what found disappointing w.r.t. the performance. My recommended for samsung is to have Snapdragon chip set so that it will make a complete device.So guys if performance does not matters for you Just go for this device this is absolute beauti from a Samsung.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Very competitive mobile in the mid range category. Camera is fine but images do not look like 64 mp.PROS1. Amoled display2. Fingerprint reader3. Samsung UI 24. Battery (good for a day)CONS1. Processor (noticeable lags)2. Speakers are neither clear nor loud enough\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Well I would like to share my honest review after using it for more than a month. Below are some pros and cons of m311.Battery life is very decent. Last for one day with heavy usage, 1½ day with moderate usage and 2 days with light usage2. Performance is also great. But Snapdragon would have been better as this phone will disappoint you if u play pubg and other high graphics game. If you only use some basic apps for office work or you are a student and use study apps, then absolutely no issue with performance.3. Due to a larger mah battery, it is somewhat heavy, yet bearable.4. Camera quality is decent in day light, with focus mode and video recording is also good, but is disappoints in night light.5. OS is also good, with less ads and high security (one of the perks of being a Samsung mobile user)6. And at last, Super Amoled screen is awrsome, with vivid colours and natural outcast. If you like videos and movies, then you are gonna like it too.Conclusion: overall it is a great product. I would give it 9 points out of 10.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  It's a good phone in this price. However, since the price is low many security features in this phone is compromised like Secure Folder, Samsung Pay, Knox etc.  Since the price is low Samsung has taken off many of these features which were even available in the earlier J Series.Performance: Although this phone comes with 6 GB RAM the performance is good as A Series phones which almost comes in the same price.Camera: Camera quality is also not that good as A Series phones although M31 comes with 64 MP back and 32MP front camera.Battery: 6000mAh battery will come for one and half dayIf you are looking for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB Storage with better performance, I would rather suggest to go for A51 which will be little higher in price.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using this device for more than 2 weeks. I am an above-average user the battery lasts around 40 hrs plus. I am happy with the device.1. About the OLED screen: I can adjust the color saturation, I have reduced the color saturation as I am not that used to vivid OLED displays. Brightness is pretty decent one good feature is that we can reduce the brightness to a lower level such that I don't want to install any 'Dark mode' application for night use.2. Camera: Camera is pretty good, the wide-angle view is pretty handy when we don't have much space in the room. The front camera is also pretty decent on low light(Recommended).3. Weight: It is pretty heavy as it has a massive 6000mah battery. However, the weight is balanced so it is nice to hold on, we won't feel it too heavy when we hold it for a long time.4. Performance: Performance is a said as in the paper, I have tried Call of Duty and worked in medium graphics well.5.Bluetooth: Bluetooth is important for me as I usually take calls with my Voyager Wireless headphones. Connection time is extremely low . I could turn on my headphone while phone is ringing and the next second the headphone is connected. I used to wait/need to manually connect on my old Zenfone max. So this is a great value add for meNB: This is not a dedicated gaming phone.To conclude with this is a very good phone for people who travel a lot and watch movies , surf internet, attend online meetings during their travel. This is not the phone for gamers\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I would rather recommend this phone rather than the Samsung M31s since most of the features are already available in Samsung M31. Albeit the camera quality is a bit lower than M31s. If you click too many close range photos then I would suggest go for the M31s. But if that doesn't bother you then paying extra 2000 bucks for trivial enhancements is not worthy. The bad thing is that it does not come with a cover and you have to buy one from outside.\\n\\n\",\n",

The most important thing as we know samsung battery backup is never satisfying any user compared to other brand. It does not last a day even if the screen is not continuous light. 2.8 out of 5.2. Exynos 9811 (10 nm), the processor is not upto mark as it consumed huge battery which is unexpected. Also, it somtimes delay/hang phone.3. One major disadvantage is the signal strength. It is not getting a proper signal while other brand are using full speed on the same place.4. Camera is hopeless at low light.Note: The battery and the signal strength really needs to improved and I hope the battery backup improve with system update.\\n\\n',\n",

U can easily stretch 2 days wid average use, even with battery below 20 percent u can easily game for 1-2 hrs (personal exp). Its a beast when it comes to battery, the only con is the amount of time it takes to charge.The fingerprint reader acts fast bt due to flat nature with the back of tge phone it gets difficult to locate, if ur using a case then no problems. But wid no case u have to locate fingerprint reader, a slight curve wud have been great!Rest I have been using the phone for more than 1 month and d phone fell for more that 7 times bt till now the front screen is intact.

If you want to buy a made in India smartphone which in it's production have given some jobs to our countrymen then go for it else choose some Chinese brand who is just assembled in India and doesn't add to our GDP.

Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge.

Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use.

       " \"\\n\\n  On the day, the mobile was released I couldn't hold my excitement and ordered this Monster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything else from this except battery life. I needed a smartphone with bigger battery that lasts longer than usual so that I can do everything that I want to.Talking about the battery life, it works as promised. On Wifi, I used continuously on Day 1, and it took 21hrs to drain from 100% to 0%. And I tested on mobile data the next day, it took around 15hrs to drain completely. Im super impressed with the battery life that I will blindly get a smartphone from Samsung if it has a big battery.Fingerprint reader and Face recognition are pretty fast. I was never expecting this speed at all. Camera quality is really good. I always had doubts in mind about cameras in Samsung, but this one cleared off everything. I feel proud to have this when I see the pictures on other handsets.Many people have misconceptions and complain about the processor in Samsung mobiles. Actually, it all depends on your usage. Processors in Samsung handsets aren't outdated, they deliver pretty good performance. I never had any such problem.The mobile is not lightweight like other mobiles. But, a 6000mah smartphone of today will definitely have this much weight. I hope the design will change in future to have a lightweight smartphone with bigger battery.Finally, I want to conclude that if you want a phone that targets Productivity, M series is best. And M31 is the King of this segment.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  My review comes after a 15 day use with the M31.The features offered by this phone at this range is really astonishing.Let it be the monstrous 6000mAh battery or the clean One UI or the Processor.I was a bit confused at first with the Processor as I felt Snapdragon offered by other manufacturers had an upper hand over the Exynos, but I am clearly mistaken as the performance of Exynos is on par with a 7 series Snapdragon (Exynos might even be better than Snapdragon).I have not faced any kinds of issues with high end gaming or continous usage.The next big thing about this phone is the Battery, the 6000mAh battery is actually the real deal.Under heavy usage I have got a battery backup of nearly 18hours.Even with the monstrous battery the phone is lightweight and easy to carry.Samsung has offered decent 64mp quad back camera which also houses an 8mp wide camera and a 32 mp front camera.In my personal opinion the M31 camera stands ahead when compared with its competitor Motorola Fusion.The fingerprint sensors are backmounted instead of inscreen unlike the new normal.The backmounted fingerprint sensor seems to be faster than the inscreen fingerprint sensors provided on the Samsung A70 smartphone.But at times I have faced issues with slow detection on my M31.Disregarding this small problem the M31 is the perfect budget phone currently in the market.I as a customer of Samsung highly recommend you to purchase this mobile phone.Worth every penny.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Giving a review after 5 months of heavy usage so worth reading.Pros-1. Unlike every other Samsung phone which is not apt for gaming , this is the one friend. Many said me that don't go for it if you want to play but it never lagged or heated up while playing high end games.Super smooth usage and interface.2. Camera is drop dead awesome. It literally justifies the 64 mp quad camera.3. I guess no one can give a negative comment on the sleek and classy look of the phone. It feels great to hold and 10 on 10 for looks.4. Screen resolution and quality is also super fine.Cons-1. The quick charge is almost equal to normal and there is nothing to get excited about.2. The battery is unable to justify 6000 mah as it claims. Other brands offering 4000mah lasts equal to this and after good all day usage u need to plug it again in the night. I expected that 6000mah will go 2 days easily but not in this case.Conclusion- After such detailed analysis after 5 months, I can easily say that the pros can easily oustand the cons and this is one of the best budget phone Samsung has offered. And with such a reliable tag of Samsung, go for it without a second thought.You will see that the other brands will offer somewhat same features in little less price but I would suggest you to go for this as this deserves the every extra penny spend, and ofcourse not a Chinese product.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing this review after 2 days of usage. I was very excited at first about this phone when it came but now I am very disappointed with it. After using for some time, I put it on charge at 10% battery and after 3 hours it was just 54%, even after 9 hours of continuous charging, it could only charge upto 74%. Also, the mobile data doesn't work after some time. We need to switch off the SIM and then ON it for further usage. I am really disappointed with Samsung. Now there is no option of returning the phone and all my money is now wasted. This policy of Amazon just proves to be a big problem for genuine buyers.Okay so after 4 days, now the charging issue is automatically solved, while sometimes the network issue still persists. Overall I am now satisfied with the product.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Here is The Review of my New M31 Samsung Galaxy Phone with 6 GB Ram and 128 GB Storage. As i m owner of CSC and having BC Point. I need phone with more data storage and fast Processor. So i bought Samsung M31 phone. It has most big advantage of having 6000 MaH Battrey which gives longer time to talk and to manage all things. Secondary thing is about storage, it also had more space for downloading big movies, songs and other documents. I love this phone also bcoz it has a feature of Dual VOLTE, which provides unlimited connectivity which means we can use Both Networks on 4G. For me i m satisfied with overall performance of this phone. So i m refering All to buy a best Samsung Galaxy S31.\\n\\n',\n",

Its a bit heavier than the S7 Edge, but it is because of the 6000mah battery.

Awesome phone for a budget.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Handson experience after 10 days.Really disappointing product from Samsung. This is utlra hyped product. Its a marketing stratagy of samsung to promote it. Only battery is the feature of the phone which last around 1.5 days on heavy usage. i am a game freak and it is good for that.The camera is pathetic mark my word pathetic its a 8 megapixel camera which they branding as 64 megapixel. when you zoom after cl8cking a photo there is no details. its all blurred out and you feel cheated like anything. the selfie camera sucks. Overall experience is bitter. I really dont like the smartphone. it is all plastic body and quite compressable. I have oppo reno phone i felt it is 1000% guinine than this cheating phone. Be aware before you buy. 2 star is only for battrry only battrry.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The battery life of this product is best so far even with heavy usage and gaming the battery stays for more than a dayCamera quality is amazingIt's not very heavy and has a sleek designSamsung has kept its focus on the cameras as the Galaxy M31 touts a 64MP quad camera setup. Other key Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications include a Super AMOLED display, 6,000mAh battery and Android 10 softwareThe front of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is familiar as well, as you're greeted by a 6.4-inch full HD+ (2,340 x 1,080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display, much like its predecessors. The display gets a U-shaped notch up top that houses a selfie camera and a fairly thick chin.Thanks to a glossy rear panel, the Galaxy M31 is a fingerprint and smudge magnet, something which is quite noticeable on the black colour variant that we received for review. Moreover, the rear panel attracts scratches if you place it on a table or in your pocket along with some keys.This mobile is the best in affordable range\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  1) Heating issue can be experienced frequently while using YouTube, downloading, uploading, updates and during charging. Few restrictions of disabling location and background apps when not in use reduces the heating issues.2) huge 6000 Mah battery but backup not up to the mark as it should be. Similar backup in my previous vivo with 3400 mah battery.3) camera 64MP but similar quality pics compared to other 48MP pics of vivo and realme.Except above, the phone is nice and good option if you don't want to purchase Chinese brands as in my case.4) very long charging time more than 2.5 hrs. It should be made fast by samsung.5) should be provided with  in box accessories like screen guard, earphones.6) backcover to be made more attractive and qualityOverall phone is good with nice display, camera features, good pics, good video recording.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  The features provided in the phone are good but what broke my trust from samsung is that despite having a 6GB RAM, i see some glitch while using this phone. There is bit of a lag while using this phone which is seriously not expected from samsung. I am disappointed in samsung on buying this product.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  \\xa0Honesty saying I'm totally satisfied and happy with this one. All in all everything is great, the interface, the display and the battery is to die for, and as for the camera the video and picture quality is also great, it lags only when it comes to night camera as it takes a bit of time to getting used to, like initially I thought the night photos looked like some oil pastel painting but now after the update and some use it's better. The features are very nice too.I also used redmi 9 pro max as I ordered that one before so I can say that I've had the opposite to compare both and I found the samsung m31 a lot more better than the redmi set which had some heating issues and some kind of camera launching issue.The super amoled display is awesome, it is a very good looking smart phone, the battery can last up upto 36 to 40 hours and it takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to charge completely from zero to hunder. The camera quality is also very good and have many additional available options and features.The processor is very efficient as I've played many games without facing any lag or problem, also I binge watch for long hours and the experience is great.\\n\\n\",\n",

As I owned a Lumia 950 earlier, I still feel the display and camera of Lumia is better than this one.\\n\\n',\n",

But never had issues but with this phone I have to unlearn every android or iOS simplicity. Samsung UI is complex.

And that too very useful.5. Battery couldn't be more great. Though it takes time to charge but once charged then it goes all day night long.6. Sound is superb. Speaker are crisp clear audio without any glitch. Call quality is great. I can talk so easily now.7. Dolby Atmos is a charm. Its headphones sound quality is super.8. Camera is great. It captures details. Although its not a dslr but its good.9. Build quality couldn't be better. Gorilla glass makes it more good.Cons:1.

Now comming to the screen, the phone comes with FHD 6.4\" super AMOLED infinity display  with infinity-U cut this is a full HD display with amazing screen quality.Internals:It works on 1UI version2 i.e. Android 10With Exynos 9611 octacore processor with10nm.Finally 6000mAh battery USB-C Port and Samsung\\'s 15Watt adaptive fast charging\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  A marvelous phone at great price which can compete with any phone in its category in all aspects and can beat them hands down. Long battery life to sustain for more than one and a half day, responsive fingerprint reader including retinal scan and a great camera to shoot at various angles.  The nail in the coffin is that its NON CHINESE and this is the minimum we can do to support the cause in such a situation. Only one demerit is that its slightly heavy, may be due to 6000 mah bty. Overall a highly recommended budget phone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  My mom has been constantly complaining of issues with the phone, i.e. like the phone keyboard sometimes not responding to touch, the audio jack breaking the earphone sound, the fingerprint not always responding. Or not getting the calls over whats-app.She has used Android phones for a long time already.So i think most could be software problems, so i installed appropriate once for her to make it work better. I am still looking up on the internet if the phone has some persistent hardware or software issues, like with the wifi card because of which intermittent connectivity problems could occur.The phone works fairly fine when i am using it.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Fingerprint reader at a weird place, if you use covers it'll be even more difficult to use.Fairly good face detection, so I use that often to unlock phone. Though difficult to detect when in dark.Super artificially enhanced and processed output from both the cameras. Would love some naturals captures that's just impossible. Not a good camera. Aap you can see in the first picture, the room is moderately lit but image is pretty bright, the details are lacking and the image is not as sharp. The second image is of outdoors, good lighting and a little enhanced colours, though if I zoom in the picture will be distorted and lacks details, which is not expected from a 64 mp camera.Amazing display, lovely colours. Same goes with the touch.Battery lasts for well more than a day on moderate usage with data on all day long, which is great.Performance is good, not best not poor either.Don't play games at all, no clue/opinion about it.Great after sales service, I received a call to check in and review the device.

       " \"\\n\\n  A good budget phone with some pretty decent features.I've used it for almost 10days. So according to me the pros and cons are listed below.Pros-----* Color reproduction of camera is nice and display the almost accurate colors.* Video stabilization is up to the mark* Amoled screens are always glamorizing* AI battery optimization (depending on your usage pattern the battery will auto optimize. It'll take some to time to learn the pattern)* Many levels of customization including fonts, themes, gestures, etc.* Processor is good enough to handle day to day multitasking. I don't play games on regular basis but games like pubg, asphalt and cod are playble (at 45-60fps). Some graphics tweaks will boost the performance.* Single speaker but loud enough for basic usageCons------* Charging takes almost 2h 45m to boost from 0 to 100.* Night mode could be optimized.Go for this phone if you're looking for a budget phone with decent features, good security patterns, long battery life and an amazing camera for outdoor and selfie shots.Note: This phone may not be suitable for gamers due to the exonys Processor. According to the benchmarks it's more powerful than a SD 675 but slower than SD 720. Go for phones with 720G or 730G.#MadeInIndia\\n\\n\"]"

First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Dear Amazon & samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.Rear Camera getting blur in low light.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone\\'s quality doesn\\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I\\'m lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage.

PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5.

It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made.

Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop.

Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps.

One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Delivery was fast, packing was good, phone started quite unusual that applications were not even downloading on wifi, later after a couple of restarts it's good now.

Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Camara is too bad. Sound clarity is not at all good ... though it looks like a premium phone ,but when you started using it makes you feel that you bought a cheap quality product. Gets frequently stuck and restarts for no reason.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device.

Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces.

One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5.

Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better.

Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  It is not 10 days that i have got this phone. But having issues in hearing some one talk from the other side or at times, the other person on the call cannot hear you. it is clear that the microphone are bad and not serving the purpose of a phone. When you play music, you can see that the volume of the song just fading off and at a point you just cannot hear any noise from the phone.When I try to return the phone its asking to install a smart check app and only if the app says there is some defect, they would take the phone back. If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one.And another point to note is that, I trusted that I would be happy with this phone, hence had purchased a special phone cover. now that money is also a waste.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  sir, I  purchased the mobile with much excitement that it would provide a wonderful experience but actually the product is not worth purchasing. After using the phone for 3 to 4 weeks the system asked for an update of the software but as soon as I downloaded the update and installed it. My mobile crashed and I can do nothing on the phone. It is neither getting switched off nor restarted. So what type of help you can provide me in this regard. I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I can\\'t believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I\\'d need to pay if anything is broken. What\\'s the warranty for? I asked what\\'s the \"Gorilla Glass\" for if it couldn\\'t handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, \"We are insiders. So we understand these things, there\\'s no such thing as \"gorilla vorilla\" it\\'s a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you\\'ll have to pay for this.\"I can\\'t believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this \"insider\" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The phone is very amazing it's more than expectation. I ordered black version with 6GB of ram and 128 GB space. Best smartphone in this segment price. The trump card  of this phone is camera. What a wide angle and selfie  captured by this phone amazingly good..  all the best feature you will get on this price.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Gorilla glass 3Its very worst fregile product. Fall ones by 5 inch and broken glass.I have Samsung Galaxy m31 i buy before 2 months.  But till i full reset my phone after that my fast charging  not working. I used already  another charger and cable  but its not workin also. I used power off mode also but it's not working.  So friends  there is no support to how to do use fast charging.  Please don't buy Samsung M series. AND after 3 months NOW comes new update fast charging is worked. 16 jun 2020 .Thank You\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Battery is very poor. It is draining at a rate of 6% per hour. I didn't expect such a poor product from samsung. Moreover, while charging for even half n hour phone heated up. It restarted by it's own after following troubleshoot procedure also.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  \\xa0Live focus Camera is too goodBattery is great which lasts for a day.Display is nice and Bigger great for watching video and playing games.Fingerprint scanner is little bit slow.Face detection also slow.But in 16 k it is value for money.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Pros:1. Display is good especially dark images or videos look great2. Really a monstrous battery3. Selfie camera is better4. Fingerprint sensor is fast5. OS is fluidic without any lag6. Call quality and reception is good7. No ads and the default Apps can be deletedNeutral:1. External speaker volume is decent but not great. Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the NokiasCons:1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.2. Phone is little heavyConclusion:If you don't want Redmi Note series phones then this is the best branded alternative at this price point\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Heating issuesLagging issuesNetwork issues these are the main problems of samsung phones..we dont need a monster battery or camera /SAMOLED display,. just need a basic performance\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Camera quality is not at all good..the sharpness of the images is very poor...also does not work good in low light condition. It does not look like Samsung.The overall experience is not at all good. Other phones in the range give better quality.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  1.Good Camera but produces Noise in Indoor Lighting Conditions Could be Fixable through an OTA Update.2.Very Good Battery Life.3.Good Display but lacks HDR 10 support.4.Processor Gives Average performance compare to Qualcomm Snapdragon Processors but its sufficient for Normal People Who don't play Heavy Graphics Related Games.5.Physical Fingerprint Scanner is Quite Fast But An In Display Fingerprint Scanner Would Give Better Experience On This Smartphone.6.Software on this device is Smooth like a Butter and Packs Some Really Good Features but Real-time Network Speed Option Should Have Been Provided For Better Experience On This Device.Maybe Samsung Could provide this feature thought OTA Update Later On.7.This Phone Comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 but They should Provided Corning Gorilla glass 5 as other brands are providing in this price range.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Purchased Samsung M31 on sale date and got delivered the very next day. As soon as i opened  the box i was disappointed  as there is no Screen protector or Mobile case available. Box has only mobile phone , type c cable and charger only. Phone was charged to 73%.Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Over heating issue and slow charging time 5 hours in full charge over slow .and proper not working in sensor..so pls don't pay ..waste your money\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  II am writing this with 4 months of usage.Issue1: Getting On-Hold automatically during calls.Issue2: Call recording also autmatically ON during calls even we dont need.Issue3: Sensors are very bad, not able to recognize call is going or not.Issue4: Camera stabilization is very bad, not able to take photo of scan docs perfectly, always it used to be blurred.Issue5: Charging time is more, even though they are telling 15w charge. My old phone get charged quickly rather than this.When i tried to reach customer care toll free, there is no response from them saying \"Limited staff\". Think before buying this model twice.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have noticed below issues with phone.* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.Also battery drains out easily* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!======================================================================================Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after more than a month of usage:- The phone heats up during charging.- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This phone is great with battery backup and picture quality but within 8 days the phone got in bootloop as sson as I got a new update and I did it. This is not even starting now.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Its OS Software got crashed in first update build release and it happened to all the M31 devices\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Hangs up in 2 months. Had to loose entire Data. Samsung service centres is always full with atleast 100 people in line. That speaks about the quality . Had similar experience in the past. Trusted Samsung for second time in vain. Never Buy Samsung Products. within 2 months touch not working and hangs up frequently.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  \\xa0The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.I purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.I have used the camera in the last 5 months. The results are very satisfactory. There may be some limitations in low light photography, but with a little tweaking, you get good results.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Dont buy samsung phones, Only gud for display clearity otherwise worst to but.Also cant return in amazon. within 2 days i tried to cantact amazon Customer service but cant reach them after reach them they said cant do return or replace so better go and buy any show rooms its better,\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am 💯 percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,Display: good,Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Well I bought this phone after listening to all the appraisal its getting around.I bought a 6 GB Variant with 128 GB internal storage.The day it came it was fineWorking fineNow its.been about a month i have been using it..My Reviews for camera .... CAMERA QUALITY IS JUST FINE but the features given like AR DOODLE etc are amazing...BATTERY LIFE IS ABOUT 1 AND A HALF DAY of normal usageGestures are amazingPROCESSOR is kinda slow which leads to lagging sometimes especially when using AR Doodle and Of course during PUBG .. Normal Heating Issue not that big of a problemThere is a slight network problem with this phone as i compared it with my 2 friends phonesOverall the processor could have been much betterOther than processor( which is most important) everything else is upto the mark\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  As I waited for a really long time to buy my Samsung galaxy phone, I am pretty disappointed with the performance of this phone.The camera quality and features are fine . But the fingerprint reader asks for so many attempts.Major issue with this phone is that it keeps restarting for no reason. That too 3 to 4 times a day !Intially I thought it needs an update and might work fine after that but that didn't work too.It's not very pleasing when it restarts in the middle of some important work you trying to finish.I have been using this phone for a month now but it has not been working upto my expectations.Sorry but not happy with my purchase.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Editing the review since camera results are very poor. Too much smudges and noises and looks like either faulty product or incorrect advertisement regarding camera specs.Well crafted product, but very poor camera qualityPros -good picture qualityNice displayBiometrics is fasterBlue color on the back looks classyGood batter lifeCons-Given the specifications found the performance a bit lackingOverall a good phone for the given price range\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Worst phone ever bought, don't  buy, charging slow, heating issues,  phone  gets heated in one small call, I will  return it,...\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I ordered this phone and received on time. Thanks to Amazon. But once I opened the packet, the box was sealed, but the phone looked to be used already like may be for 1-2 days. There was a little scratch on the side of the phone, many applications weren’t working properly on the phone (ex: YouTube, Spotify), but eventually YouTube was fine but Spotify still has problem. I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person’s voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn’t show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don’t have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand. It may stop working any time.Poor experience with amazon as well as the Samsung galaxy m31.I don’t even want to keep this phone, It gave me that bad experience in just 2 days of using it. But amazon is not supporting at all.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Most disgusting service from Amazon & Samsung ever. Received a defected Mobile which had issues with its touchscreen. Replacing the phone is such a pain in the wrong place. First they ask you to download a stupid app to run testing which takes incorrect tests. I have problem with my touchscreen & they test the fingerprint sensor & give a result stating that all is good. Secondly I cannot contact any customer care agent as no one is available at this point of time. Customers are left to fend for themselves. \"Atmanirbhar\" is taken to a whole new level by Amazon!!! Utterly DisgustingPlease sort this out Amazon before your customers shift to other online apps.Samsung, Where has your quality gone? Do you only focus on expensive phones? One Plus & other brands have already started eating up your market share.. please act wisely if you don\\'t want to share your fate with Nokia.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Received my Samsung Galaxy M31 on 7th Mar. It cost me 15,999 rupees.Literally shocked to see the Indian sim card only labeled on box.Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic. They said they cannot write everything about product.Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Bought this phone.  Received in time.  delivery is good.  Product is very very bad.  Plan to exchange it even for china mobiles.  I bought this mobile as my friend is happily using M30 for 2yrs.  I thought M 31 will be better than M30.1.  Audio quality is very very bad -  Not able to hear even when speaker is on with max volume and all equalizer settings.  All possible solutions available on line were tried in vain.2.  Frequently hangs even for a simple task like calling!  Then we have to press the power key to switch off and switch on -  this happened 4-5 times in 10 daysI dont feel like using a new mobile.  Not worth for 20,000.  I am planning to exchange it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Totally flop phone,worst experience of my life to buy this mobile.After 15 days of purchase camera fail,always hanging problem.Now service center tell mother board and camera of this phone require to change.I feel cheated,I don't no whom to blame-AMAZON/SELLER/SAMSUNG.But my suggestion is never brought this M31.After spending a huge amount now I am running towards SERVICE CENTRE and there is a huge waiting during this pandemic and as usual server problems.Now today my phone is submitted and may be in 3-5days its problem solved.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I ordered the phone on June 1, which was delivered on June 5. I tried to start the phone. It didn't. I put it in the charger. No light. Nothing. Phone was completely dead. Same day I tried to put request Amazon replace/ refund section. Now here comes the worst part. It does not allow you to refund/ replace. Rather, it asks you to talk to customer service. However, there is no one in customer service to answer your phone.

After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre-installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re pre-installed, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I bought 2 phones 10 days back. Biggest problem is from day 1, in both mobiles every now and then signal drops completely and I need to restart the phone to get signal back.

I did all that was suggested by samsung but nothing worked. Now I have to waste time going to service center.Another shocking fact is non of the reviews have pointed this problem where on the internet there are many people affected.If this is not sorted, I will sue samsung!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Operating and dispaly is not goodNot user friendlyNot as per expexted quality\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Worst phone ever i purchased in my life.

Please do not buy.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Please don't buy this phone. It has major heating issues. It gets drastically heated while watching videos, while taking photos, during calls and also while charging. 6000mah battery is just for name sake. It works for 1 to 1.25 days without heavy usage. Full charging takes upto 3hrs. Speaker quality is also bad.The only good thing about this phone is camera.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I will not recommend this product to anyone due to the following facts:1. Exynos 9611, which is a 10 nm processor, produces so much lagg.2. 6000 mah battery is just a gimmick. It is also not comparable with even 4000 mah battery of other brands. It does not even last for a single day with moderate usage i.e. surfing with wifi connectivity (no gaming or watching videos).3. 64 mega pixel camera is another gimmick. No detailing is there.

The hardware supports this feature but Samsung has not activated th CA feature. Even my two year old moto had this!

Exynos 9611 is fair enough to handle the daily work but it's a little old processor, it would be better if it would come with any of the latest ones.2.

The phone has a massive 6000 mAh battery and it supports fast charging only upto 15 watt. It would be better if would support 25 watt because it takes quite a time to charge the battery fully.N.B.

You need to press power button and volume button simultaneously--screen mirroring is very poor does not works-- Camera is also poor than MI phones-- while opening web link gives only one option to open using Samsung Browser.-- many other usability issues.--overall you will feel going back to MI due to issues in usability\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Good phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good. But looks wise the company could do better using glass or metal.Fingerprint reader is accurate and so is face recognition.Battery is powerful and long lasting. Keeps you going all day!Camera quality is awesome and comes with many cool features also! Pictures and videos are sharp and true to their color and high quality.Overall, it comes with many features and the brand Samsung adds to the value and trustworthiness of this phone!! Using it for three months now. Smooth and perfect.PA: no proper cover available. I wish samsung provided it.even if for extra cost with high quality for protection.Couldn't find any till date. Help me if someone has recommendations.:(\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera ReviewThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.Galaxy M31That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security ReviewGalaxy M31The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance ReviewGalaxy M31The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone10. Night mode photos are stunning. The first photo given above is of Hyderabad nightline, taken from my balcony.11. Next two photos are of clouds taken from an Indigo flight.12. Next snap is of cardamom flowers in my garden.13. The last one is pav baked by me at home. Snap taken with Food Mode. I found in food mode pictures coming alive.I especially impressed with night mode and food .Ode photos. They are si.ply superb.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Phones battery life is good but it gets heated for example when you are on call for a long time for while booking cabs when location is on it takes a lot of battery No pop up notifications in WhatsApp phone needs work in accessibility I am a low vision person the phones keyboard gets too much expanded when using zoom gesture making it impossible to type I have to reboot the whole phone to get the keyboard to its normal size . Select to speak options hangs frequently and the phone becomes unaccessible.after my purchase there was a software update due to which my screen gets zoom automatically creating problem while using which is very irritating face recognition is not that good phone takes two and a half hour to charge completely.Camera is really nice beautiful pictures come out.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Missing app lock and secure folder, I hope software update will fix it in future.Headphone is missing 😩.Downloaded s secure from galaxy store for App lock.Removed unnecessary preloaded apps.Add restrictions for background data if you want to save data and battery.Great Camera tested in all moods(check in pictures).Night mood is superb.Anyone posting bad reviews about camera is personal intentions.Freefire or pubg consums 6% battery per hour. But remember it depends on your network speed.Fast charging is working perfectly,Still moving my apps from old galaxy J7 Pro, I will update my review after 1 month.Nice phone.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I purchased a samsung M31 on 11 th mar 2020 ,it had heating issues on the upper part of the screen,I have talked to the  customer care regarding this issue,,they told download blancco app,but it is not working properly,I cannot get my money  ,waste of product ,do not buy again ,very disappointed  this kind of experience,mobile inspection  service technician did not came as per confirmation  customer  care,\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  An awesome product.Value for money.The battery is so much good that it is unbelievable. About battery I want to say something that please do charge the phone for the first time to 100% fully charge and then use the phone or else the battery life reduces.The camera quality is awesome. Just remember to apply correct settings.Front camera photos looks awesome.Phone performance is also very good. Very smooth controls and the screen quality is also very good.Sound quality is also up to the markThe phone has an excellent sensor coordination for everything.It also has a virtual proximity sensor and an AR support from Google with an excellent gyro sensor.The fingerprint sensor is also very fast.The face unlock feature is above everything.It detects face automatically when your phone is kept upright even without turning screen on. It will detect your face and automatically turn on.The look of the phone is also very nice with a glassy look on back.This is a power packed phone which will always win over any phone in this price range.I think everyone should try this experience.I trust Samsung and still I think it is better to buy a Samsung phone than to buy other phones even if they are offering some more features.I am very happy to write this review.I think this review you make impact a bit.Just stop here and buy this product.After using it you would be feel that your decision was right.Thank you for reading my review till last.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I thoroughly like this mobile.Very smooth to handle.The camera is very good in day light and medium to low light.The battery back up is awesome. It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  At 1st i want to say above all the images are shoot on the samsung m31. The camera quality is amazing just amazing in macro camera awesome the 64mp mood is very good, zooming quality also best, the battery life is very long 5000mah but some how you can't notice the 5000mah, fingerprints scaner is also good, And the PROCESSOR in good but it is not good for gaming, if you use this phone as daily use as other uses then go for it blindly, and overall  its comes in very good condition, thanks amazon for delivering this phone in good condition. Thanks you ARNAB BANERJEE.👍❤️📱\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It is a best budget phone with the amount of provided specs in it, having a massive battery of 6000mah gave me a decent backup of upto 2 days, if you are a average user then this is a phone you want, I played all types of games in it from ludo to asphalt 9 and pubg but it stood up to its name as not much of battery drain but minute lags were observed at the start but later on after few second everything got ok, adaptive brightness is very good but was not working some times had to manually set it but sometimes switching it off and on came as a solution, fingerprint sensor is quick but some times doesn't works if it is a bit dusty, also if you hands are wet it will take multiple attempts before giving access, most of the reviews I read about back panel color and material quality was negative as compared with other phones but personally i liked the color of back panel as I have the ocean blue you can call me old fashioned but there are many reasons like 1. It looks good,  2. Doesn't slips from you hand 3. Eventually you are going to use a back cover with it and etc, I have a transparent back cover over mine coz no other color would be that good as it's original, its display is one of the best as the picture quality and the color contrast and many other aspects cannot be compared with other phones in market, it also provided built in Dolby atmos when using earphone which totally changes the experience of audio while watching movies or listening songs its is just amazing, I was averagely satisfied with the camera as the night mode is not that good when compared with other phones, macro shots are very good but struggles a bit to focus, I did not find any much difference between slow mo and ultra slow mo, providing inbuilt custom stickers and emoji are good and enjoyable, speaker volume are good for a average noisy room conditions but not for listening songs outdoors, there are many gestures which takes time to get comfortable with but once you are life gets easier also there are many other features which proved helpful for day to day working environment, over all it is a best phone for average and heavy usage until and unless you are planning to play heavy games on it entire day long with heavy graphics requirementThank you 😁\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage. The new USB connector is a joy, with the option of high power charging for those urgencies when traveling.. backed by Amazon's super logistics and accessories options, this is a great buy!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  My review after 2 months usage..Finger print reader working great.Battery life, 1 full day if you use internet streaming. Otherwise u can count for  3 days.Camera Quality good. Long viewshotsworkinggood.Look wise , touch wise its good.It will take 3 hrs to full charge.Facial recognition also poor.Wifi working great.But Signal accessing from mobile Networks was too slow.I will give 0 rating for this Mobile Network Connection.Very very slow internet speed.I have to connect Wifi with others mobile data through Hotspot.Mobile at this price range with such a Horrible networking performance not acceptable.Its my personal view.  Do your own research before you buy.Thank you.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  My review after using the phone after 4 months of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.Pros:1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.6. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.Cons:-1. Night mode isn’t the best.2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.3. It doesn't come with earphones.4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.Conclusion:-If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.Regards,Yash\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It's an upgrade to the M30s. The screen is good with a raindrop camera. The Super Amoled display is quite good to use even while at outdoors.The massive 6000 mah battery easily gives backup upto 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.It takes around 2 hours 40 mins to 3 hours on initial charging from zero to 100 percent.For Gamers there a Game Booster App.The camera is also quite good with lots of options to choose from.Cons:The phone has some bloatwares, some from samsung, and some third party like Helo app. Some apps like fb can only be disabled.Overall a Good Phone, and the massive 6000mah battery is really good for moderate to heavy users.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  First of All I am Not a Gamer I uses phone for calls n l,ill bit of surfing.1.Average Camera2.Phone heating like a bomb even with  normal use.3.Its shows Fast charging on screen but  actually charges slower than Normal  phones which do not have this feature  with same battery capacity.4.Battery last for one day with normal  uses.Final verdict : Lower than average Phone with Bogus and hyped advertisement.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have upgraded my mobile from m30s to m31.Yesterday i got this mobile.after being use for 32 hrs .I have noticed many flaws in this mobile1.Very poor network.Internet speed is dead slow .no constant network .I checked my sim with my old m30s.pretty decent coverge and good net speed .But with m31 very poor unsustained network.2.Battery is 6000 Mah but doest seems like 6000mah.M30s has better battery capacity discharge than m31.in m31 after a full charge when internet is used continuously it last for just 5 to 6 hrs .I never faced this problem with m30s .In m30s battery will remain for atleast 12 to 16hrs on usage.But in M31 very disappointed3.It has better Ram but doest seems to be that worth.6gm ram but i got hanged 4 times while using and  5 times my app crashed(app stopped working).Till now in M30s i never faced this issue.One the 1st day of usage itself im veryyy veryyy disappointed.Replacement requested,need to wait for 10 more days to get it replaced as they are out of stock.My request is go for m30s it is cheaper than m31 and also better than m31 .\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The phone is decent at this price point . I don't like the phone too much,as it has samsung branding so I expect more but at this price many phone available better than this but it's battery backup & display quality is best. But it's not a gaming phone, I don't like the Exynos processer for gaming. Overall good but not recommended for gaming & heavy usages. The main thing it's camera , it has 4 camera but don't think it's too good but I like the selfi camera which I mostly used. Best for old generation people.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Decided to buy samsung phone after using all known chinese brands like vivo,oppo etc in last 5 years. But after using for 15 days realized why samsung lost market share rapidly to the chinese players. The phone has the same issues tht samsung used to have 5 years back like getting changed,features like adaptive brightness doesnt work and pictures with 64 megapixel camera  leaves white patches on the face.phone has a lag and not fast .samsung seriously needs to review its product quality otherwise customers will surely dump it and go for Chinese brands\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Very good product. I read about the concerns on the camera but still decided to go ahead. The mobile is fantastic. Camera, OS everything is good. This was my first online purchase of this value and had concerns there. But was delighted as everything went smooth. There was a delivery OTP provided by Amazon hence the delivery person had to deliver to me in person which was good. I was worried that he shouldn't leave it with security in my absence. 2nd, the seller had packed it nicely, the primary pack seal by the manufacturer was intact hence a genuine new pack. Overall, had a great experience - product, delivery and the  seller.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I orderded 8 GB ram with 128 GB storage. Seriously, samsung is doing remarkable in this segment. I was Iphone user and seriously I purchased this phone to get more handy with android OS.Camera: Too good. Many options and works in almost all condition.Sound: Dolby supports to Bluetooth and wired headphones. AmazingDisplay: No competition.. sAMOLED is doing its best. The contrast is such black even you cant make difference between the body black color and the screen black color. Phone looks very nice when I use dark mode.Battery: Monster battery, full usage will give you 1 and half day life. if average use then it will last for 2 days.Charging Cable: it is only 0.5 Meter, Samsung why why are you giving such small length wire? how much are you saving 50 INR? Also i found the charging cable is with poor quality.No Case: Generally silicon case we get by 150 INR outside, samsung would have given it then it was good. but its not there in box.Overall this product is superb choise if you have budget under 20K (for this variant of 8GB RAM 128 GN Storage)\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's really good device. Battery is a freaking beast, amoled display is beautiful and UI is very slick and simple. I got nothing to complaint considering what I paid for it. I would never buy crappy Xiaomi phones with its obscene notifications. Go for samsung phones, they don't push anything vulgar with their phones.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Got SG M31 more than a week ago. Ran into issues. Got in touch with CC and Tech support. They arranged a tech visit. Tech visit confirmed issues with the phone -- a replacement was done. Got a smooth working phone now and I have no complaints. Infact I want to thank all those involved in getting me  a replacement.Now for the phone itself. Big display--good display--but not HDR enabled though Vivid color setting does a pretty good job. I am not the Cheapo kind who takes selfies and uses a lot of Tik Tok so camera is not a big deal for me But the camera  is real good HDR pics are nice and slow mo and time lapse are amazing. Live focus is a amazing feature in camera. Sound quality is awesome and better than redmi note 6 pro which i was using earlier. Good snappy phone for daily app usage. I don't waste my time on games so no comments. UI is good with ease of use all around. Love the AOD display.Bought a sandisk type C usb otg but it didnt show in storage. Maybe I dont know how to use it. Overall a good phone and highly recommended. Happy bought a made in India phone will sell my old redmi note 6 pro to some anti-national.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  if you are purchasing forCamera - you can do better than this.Games - you can do much better.Battery life - even this will do , please do not expect miracles from 6000 figure.Phone , map , whats app or lots of apps ( productive apps not entertainment types ) at this cost with nice to touch feel - yes this is the phone you should consider.Screen - please buy this , screen image quality is so good , even a dull photo looks good.Phone looks - nothing jazzy , plain and simple15W charging is okay not fast types and when charging 6000 battery is like back to old school.Sound - a bit weak but its okay if you become DJ just once in two months.Software or bloatware - Samsung have better and useful products which all are not provided with this model as its a mid range but what all is given in not sufficient but with that kind of RAM and storage , go get how many do you like.Charger is not small but charging cable isGorilla glass is effectivePhone is not slim but far from uncomfortable.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have been using this phone for quite some time now and I consider myself eligible to review it. Initially, I was very confused if I should be going for M21 or M31 but glad that I chose the latter.Pros:Excellent quad camera and front cameraThe battery lasts for 1.5 days with minimal gamingUI is really cool compared to other Chinese brandsMade in India & most importantly the majority of the parts are not from ChinaCons:Charging takes time (approx 2.5 - 3hrs) considering it is 6000 mah batteryBuild quality could have been better (all plastic)Charger wire is shorter compared to all the other brands which I used earlierTips:Charge your phone in airplane mode and it will be quickerBuy tempered glass on Amazon only as offline tempered glasses from the roadside are not good and will hamper the clarity of the screenBack case is recommended as the phone is prone to scratchesPurchased Boxxo tempered glass from Amazon along with Valueactive carbon filter back case. Both are good and protect your phone to a great extent and also enhances its looks\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 did resonate to me, with another ‘M31’ - Andromeda Galaxy.In the universe of mobile-phones, Samsung M31 is a star in the galaxy of its kind.Why Samsung?Intrinsically, I am a fan of Samsung products.Excellent product design and manufacturing. Highly reliable. It was time to change my old 3G Samsung mobile. Finally I settled for this one.Why M31?In my professional life, I worked on R&D, and fabrication of VLSIs. That made me a perfectionist in the field of photography. So  I was looking for an affordable mobile phone as an aid to my DSLRs. This M31 met all my expectations.The Samsung M31.The high-resolution front and quad-camera system at the rear. Excellent exposure sytem. Brilliant colour rendition. All these through world class Samsung display.The hardware is perfectly matched with its operating syste. I was amazed using its never-used-before features. I found, there's more than one way to peel an apple. With its 6000 mAh battery the phone is very thin and light. Finally, true value for money.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  less think before go for it.!!!!!!Becoz:Most Affordable the best smartphoneBest delivery by amazon.Nice Looks.Best in performanceBest in class camera.Best in class display.Best call receiving .Best game response.Very important for me is best Camera.Total awesome experience .Affordable mobile phone in budget.Thanks a lot to samsung groupFinal conclusion::best  smartphone i have ever used.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I am using my new phone for almost a month now. The phone looks great and value for money to me. The delivery of Amazon was perfect. I will list down the pros and cons below:Pros1. Battery life of the phone is awesome. On medium usage it lasts for 2 days. The charging time is 2.5 hours though, which a bit high for charging 6000mAh battery.2. Screen, colors and resolution all are a masterclass.  Samsung and its screen are the best thing to have. There is some bezel in the screen and I didn't like the idea of curving screen at the corners. It is manageable though.3. Touch and keypad are good and responsive.Cons1. Processor on the slower side. Good for its category but definitely not the best.2. I didn't like the build quality of the phone.  While the shape is sharp and finish is good, I find the phone little bit bulky.3. The menu and options are not the most user friendly. I used an Oxygen os before and believe me it was much smooth in sorting things.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  worthless phone excessive heating the phone heats up like iron. the radiations level of the phone are above standard planning to launch a complaint against Samsung under product liability 2019 and cpa 1986....Amazon for supporting this kind of crappy product for sale.... you all the dealer Samsung and importer who is also liable for not declaring information required under law....\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Camera: 3.8/5Battery: 5/5UI: 5/5Fingerprint reader: 4/5Screen: 5/5The first and foremost reason to buy it is that its not a China brand. Had a Mi phone which stopped working after 7 months had to visit service centre to replace battery which has warranty of 6 months. Charged me Rs.1880 for it. After raise issue to Mi CS atleast they refunded my Rs. 524.Now, about M31 if you looking for decent phone with Amoled screen and bigger battery this the phone for you.For some people not having glass body may feel like a deal breaker but for me whi has used a glass body phone with back cover doesn't feel like much difference, phone is 90% of time in back cover.Camera id descent for thus price range, won't  say the best but gives satisfactory results and quad camera setup many more options to play with.Samsung needs to upgrade from 9611 processor but still for a user like me it doesn't  make any difference.Any body looking to buy a new phone can wait and buy M31s which has a better charging and screen.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This review is for users who mostly use mobile for calls, watching videos, some social media and photography!!Looks: This phone is Huge! For watching videos it is fun but handling it can be tricky... Plastic back is fingerprint magnet so cover is recommended.Screen: stunner! Big screen + amoled is great combination! Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.Always on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.Battery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.Few hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays)I am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.Charging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%(Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.)Performance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.Camera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.Attached some sample shots.Macro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.Wide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.Selfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.Video recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!Summary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt. Had to uninstall it manually)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  2 STAR TO 4 STARDEAR ALLIM writing the review after usage of Samsang M31 after one month. The below review was written after 2-3 days of usage of same. But after 1 month I chage my mind and believe it's one of good phone cader. Not bad as wat I have written below( my early review)Battery back up is too good and performance wise to its a MONSTER. Camera too good. The only area in which the phone lage is loud speaker. That they have to improve.👍👍👍👍🤳Thx allMy early review👇Very much Disappointed  with the product M31 I was previously  using MI A2. I bought this after so much research from review from Amazon.  The major disappointment was with speakers both loud speakers & phone speakers  quality  is not at all acceptable. Very cheap sounds never ever I used it before in my entire life time.I play free fire ( only game I have in my mobile)In MIA2 (6GB Ram ,128 storage ) I never got up hang my mobile. But in case of M31 (8GB RAM 128 STORAGE) I got hang every time 🤣🤣🤣If you have other options plz go for it. I will never come back to Samsung in my life time.I hesitate to go for redmi before I  buy MiA2. This time too I thought to for Mi. Still gone for Samsung. But it proved me wrong.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Hello All..I'm writing this review after few months of usage, but this should not be different as per my experience. I feel this instrument is having all necessary features in this price range for those who believe in smart work and nice user interface.I liked the most..- Android 10! Latest looks & works Beautiful...ahead of all- One UI is the superb experience as compared to other ones which are cheap. Feel the REAL look and damn useful features required for what is called as SMART WORK- Dark Mode is the best feature I wish for- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging.- 6000 mh battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support VoLTE...i really appreciate this- The Mobile Mic and speaker is good and clear- Camera is really good.  Video stabilization option is excellent- Face unlock, figure-print sensor response is quickAdditional requirement- I wish Samsung should provide a screen guard and back cover along with the handset. This is very good business trend and customer convenience. This will also help to protect the instrument from Day1 of usage.Finally the icing on the cake is..If you are thinking to buy a new phone, you can always consider this on priority being proudly Made In India. The day is not so away...MONSTER will surely beat the DRAGON\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Using this mobile for  almost 2 months now. Just before lockdown i bought it and it started hanging within a week so i wasn't able to place an exchange or return order complaint. The battery life is also very less as compared to other mobile phones I've used. Plus it mentions 6000mah which it definitely not at all acceptable. Also it starts to heat up pretty quickly and then you'll not be able to use your phone for another 30 mins. Not at all satisfied with the product.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Many people have written a lot about this phone. So let me give you my quick observation:1. Screen is good, but has yellow tint. People used to super bright screens will not like it.2. The max brightness is also not as much as other good quality phones.3. Battery life is ok at best. But that is because of Samsung os. You can enable it to kill more apps to preserve battery.4. Samsung one os is ok ok. Lacks many things in 2020! Scrollable wallpapers missing on home screen. Sms and calling app look outdated. App launcher is also ok ok. No issues have installed nova launcher. Can also recommend lawnchair.5. Sar value is low, so range is not max always. Some basic issues with wifi tooHope samsung will fix color tint issue and other os issues.So at almost 20k not worth it. But hey I bought it because it is not a Chinese phone. So extra money spent on nationalism. Jai Hind!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Worst ever phone any one can buy ...really shameful that these type of third grade products are being sold on Amazon. I ordered a Samsung phone on 14th March it was defective so a replacement was sought on 20 th march but due to lockdown andreturn pickups not happening it could not happen finally Amazon person came in JUNE but refused to replace it as its outer cover was not there I pleaded but he refused to budge I was left with a defective piece so went to service center my phones camera ,Jack, battery have been replaced but still issues are there , a brand new phone turned out to be a dud...really shocking even now battery drains too quickly...in this price range many phones are available please dont go for it ..worst ever purchase with zero service from both amazon and samsung .P.s - there service  center will keep on saying that no parts are available and will keep your phone for around a week. So have another phone ready with you as you will need it.My honest advice dont buy this phone.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is a short review after the first 24 hours of the M31 6GB 128GB black color phone I have bought. I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks  (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone,  buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly.  This is huge.So should you buy M31? Unless you are a high end gamer the answer is YES.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I am using Samsung Galaxy M31 last 10 days. I feel I made best choice this time.1. Android v10.0 OS with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor really good performance. No lagging.2. Excellent Display. Blue ligth filter is cool.3. 6000 mah battery is very usefull for continuous user like me. Fast charging & no heating problem.4. Camera is good. Macro performance is very good. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.5. Both dedicated sim slots support LTE.6. Mobile speakers sound is good but when I use earphone I am not getting full clarity.7. Finger print sensor response is compartively very good.8. When I ordered phone I was thinking it is big size but it is very handy..!9. Storage expandable upto 512GB is really usefull.I feel phone is really worth for the price & you may like to use it. Without doubt you may order.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Phone has a .massive battery as stated by Samsung 6000mah capacity.  But trust me it's useless. Battery backup in average moderate usage will not last even a complete full day by the end of the your battery percentage will be around 15 to 20. Which is really disappointing.  Trust me my honor 8x mobile with just 3450 mah battery gives a similar back up. What is the point of buying such a phone then. Camera is good. Low light capture is efficient enough at this price range. Finger print sensor is okay. Not great as my honor 8x has a lightning fast finger 3sensor when compared to Samsung. Also I found a sense of lag in the UI when going through the phone like pressing the back button for returning etc.  Samsung need to fix the bug for battery drain its drains like crazy. Disappointed with the battery.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  A nice phone for Rs 16000. It also manages tonplay asphalt 9 on highest graphics settings. Yes i did face a bit of heating issue. To solve it, update the firmware to latest version, Reduce brightness to minimum , turn on battery saver and turn on dark mode. It wiil solve most of the heating problem. U would still get a little heat while steaming youtube video, whatsapp video call or playing games or doing a phone call for some time or simply charging the phone but that's quite normal for any android phone\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Bought this product when launched at its lowest price, had to wait quiet long for the product after intense surveying because I was avoiding high end phones because life of each phone is nearly same, and during the pandemic it was of utmost importance to save each penny instead of spending freely and also wanted to avoid phones manufactured by China.I had decided to buy a phone within 20K and this phone gave me all features which are in top end phones(30K-40K), off course there is difference in the quality.1.Camera picture quality- Though it has nice cameras(number wise e.g 64MP,32MP) clarity of picture is not so good,but worth it in this price range.2.Battery- 6000 mAh it says but it isn't actually its 5825 mAH and I use a third party battery application called accu battery which is especially for battery its charging speed,health,discharging,sleep time etc. and it shows around 5400 mAH, so can't be sure of battery, though they have got a certification regarding this but am not sure.3.RAM- I have 8GB ram version and its worth it in this price range. Sometimes it lags but that is acceptable.4.Internal memory- 128GB its satisfactory, what is even better that it has a dedicated slot for memory card and since  had onnem my previous device I was happy in it.Overall speaking it is a good range phone, especially it is MADE IN INDIA, of a South Korean company.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  An average phone with decent features that are usually available with any Samsung Mobile.What i didn't like -1. High battery charging time of over 2hrs for 100%2. Phone heats up quite quickly. Upgraded OS and right on day 1, it got heated up during the upgrade3. Poor quality camera - but can't expect more from a 18k mobile4. Large and bulky - poor design- again, can't expect more at that price5. Performance isn't greatOnly good things1. Display - good for that price and size2. It is Samsung!What am I comparing with? Oppo, Poco & Samsung A series.Have always been using Flagship mobiles and this one was just a secondary mobile for home, yet it is not quite exciting.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Editing after using few days. Don't trust samsung. I have used so far 2 models. All flop.Lot many issues in this model - Camera shots coming blank.Bluetooth not working smoothly. Its braking in just 2 mtr away speaker. Other phone I had it was super fantastic iPhone old though. It was working if its 10mtrs also.Facebook watch videos flickering. Need to close all n open again to view from scratch.Buggy and  bulky model.Dislike same old UI icons. Bulky design like old mobiles. Camera is fantastic. Got screen glitch while playing preinstalled games. That shows some issue in software.Also Samsung fircebly adding few unneccessary games app in build which is not needed. Not able to figure out how to stop those popup alerts.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Almost every call gets dropped after 20 to 30 seconds. On same SIM , other phones are working fine. So , its device problem.Expected more on other side but not up to expectations. Over all rating a B- if calls drop issue is resolved, else its worthless.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  After using the phone for 3 months, i am writing this review.Pros:- Battery backup- Dual 4G Dual WiFi calling- High Quality LED Display- Camera in HDR mode- Sleek design- SpeedCons:- initially had restarting issues, later resolved after software update- Heats up on long video calls and battery drains fast due to high quality video- Camera could have been better, zooms in digital mode, not optical- Security lock function for each app not availableOverall an excellent phone at this price range with an excellent battery backup. You cannot expect a DSLR clarity for this price even if you have a 128 pixel in Digital zoom.If you are willing to buy only for a high quality camera, not a good choice. I have attached some shots, you can have a look and decide. Otherwise i am happy with my purchase 6 GB RAM & 128 GB Storage with a pretty good speed of operations.Mangal S\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a disappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.A little more details after a couple of months usage. This phone needs to be little more rugged as it can crack at edges and screen very easily. An aluminum/any metal body would be much better. The battery after 2hrs 20 mins charge can easily take you through the day with above moderate usage. For heavy users, still a fast charging option may be required at the end of day. I mean who keeps phone to charge for 2+ hours? You cannot risk charge it whole night too. Samsung has produced a nice phone. It could be a game changer with some more changes.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  White is not white. Screen is too warm in color. Video of human face has red tint. Selfie is totally horrible, it is beautifying fully and make clean face removing all the details. Signal quality is poor. Rs 8000/- phone redmi was connecting to internet without any issues and this phone was not. Also it was observed that voice will be heard after 5 seconds of call getting connected. This happens quite some times. Sound output is less both in speaker mode and in earpiece mode. I didn't expect so many issues with such reputed brand. Pl visit reviews with my above comments in google or GSM arena.com, many have brought out same points. But battery life is too good. Colors are punchy and vibrant but not natural  they are like over saturated.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Phone features are excellent, but customer service is worst..My phone fell down frm just 2ft and lcd disappeared, although screen guard or lcd haven't any scratch or broken. I've visited Samsung customer care, they stateted lcd will available after 15days n u you'll be charged 5500. I argued about the phone condition, display haven't broken.. He said, its company policy if you want to get it repaired, you've to pay, or else keep it with u.. They've kept phone for 15days and then informed Tht, lcd is not available, you can collect coupon worth 10000 n can purchase any Samsung product frm Samsung store..Maybe several customers had faced problem alike me.. Kindly, file a complaint against Samsung, result may be late but company have to compensate..\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Writing this review after two weeks of usage. The phone has some weight to it, which is something I was looking for and it really feels good to hold in hand just like the old rugged Motorola's.Display and the battery capacity are something which impressed me a alot and I can definitely vouch for it. Camera is also cool, but not that great, but it is good enough for the price you pay.The only thing I am little disappointed was it has some lag while browsing and if it is improved, the phone really rocks for the price.Overall when compared to chinese phones in the market, Samsung is really doing good in terms of service, trust and the value of the product.Also, would like to thank Amazon for fast delivery and awsome service.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Detailed opinionFingerprint scanner- quick but you have to clean the sensor before usingCamera- selfie is ok rear camera is amazing in natural lightings but average in darkBattery- excellent i get 3 days backup for using about 5 hrs a day of heavy to moderate usageScreen- super colour reproduction and very responsiveBuild- phone is very well balanced doesnt feel heavy and material is durable .just keep a back cover to avoid scratchesCharging- average charging time it takes 3 hrs in normal mode and about 2 hrs in fast charging modeSpeakers-decently loud but very clearSoftware-one ui is the best.

I use it for watching videos and it comes for 2 days.. camera quality is good for me, though not like nokia 8 ,but good enough for the price..I don't take selfies.. I've put the phone down from hip level 3 times accidentally and it has not broken so far.. better to have a flip cover for protection.. so my overall experience is very good as I got it after reading a lot of specifications.. I don't play games so I don't know about that.. why I didn't choose poco or redme was coz of the ads and battery life..hope it helps..\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Complete package at the price point.Amazing camera and great battery life.

MUST-READ.Samsung has literally poured premium qualities in this phone.1)CAMERA - Quad Camera rich quality photos. Even after Zoom, details are very clear & No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear & stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent & reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality & long-lasting capacity).3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick & so far no single glitch.4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass. (also depends upon on the quality of your headphones like How much it supports to this technology)5)CALL QUALITY- Premium mic quality. Crisp & Clear voice calls. Supports almost all CODECS including Aptx6) RAM - Best RAM management, even after you play heavy graphics games along with complex tasks, you'll see approx 1.5gb still left. That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience & to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance & during multitasking & Gameplay.8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings. Recommending to use Built-in Game Booster feature for Thriving Gaming experience along with AMOLED graphics. Just Imagine.9)BATTERY - 6000mAh juice will give you an output of approx 2 Days on avg use & 1 day(20hrs) on heavy usage.SUMMARY -  If you looking for a maintenance-free consistent device for 3-4 years then Go for It without hegitation.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Excellent product..the specifications of this phone are truly amazing and not just on paper , the performance  of the phone doesn't let you down at any instant. The fingerprint reader is quick to respond and has no delay in unlocking the phone.  The camera is the highlight of this phone which allows users to capture splendid pictures (64MP) I myself have clicked numerous  pictures and haven't  faced any issues with the camera. The battery  life of this phone is more than adequate  for daily usage as well as gaming(performs well while running heavy games also). I'm extremely  pleased with the product and would recommend  this phone to anyone  looking for a smooth and hassle free experience.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I ordered the phone on 5th March'20 and got on 8th March'20 as promised by Amazon I had been using this phone for past 3 days. Kindly find my review below.Pros:Amazing battery. Single charge for 2 days minimum.Screen clarity is good. SAMOLED displayProcessor speed is ok.Played PUBG for continous 3 hours. Battery drained by 10% only.Phone is light weight.Wifi calling.5G wifi support.Loved this dark mode.Samsung VPN.Cons:Heating up issues as in all Galaxy M series.Camera quality is average.Full charge requires 2 hrs.Finally 15,999 for Samsung is ok to buy.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I received this pohne from Amazon yesterday. Let me start by saying that this phone is completely Made in India and the quality and finish is as good as any other imported phone that you will get.The specs of the phone are simply awesome and for the price it is an excellent buy. The Amoled screen is very good and has a Gorilla Glass hence there is no need for a screen protector, but no harm if you want to put one. It is advisable to have a back cover as the finish is shiny and could be a bit slippery.I have still not used the camera extensively but from the few pictures that I took during the daytime, they are very good.Took early for me to comment on the battery life but it comes with an awesome 6000 mAh which lasts for a very long time. Of course this will be dependent on what you use the phone for.It comes with a 15W fast charger. It charged the phone from 65% battery to full in little over one hour.Transferring all your stuff from your old phone to the Samsung M30 was a simple straight forward affair using the Samsung Smart Switch. You will need to download this on your old phone from Google Play Store. I did the transfer using the wireless mode.The specs of this phone are unbeatable for the price.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Samsung galaxy m31 is excellant phone and reasonable price. Battery life is very good as if we charge for 2 hours it's more than enough for two days.Its had very pixel and great clarity images.videos are amazing.Fingerprint reader is working .\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have been using M31 from last 3 months here are some pros and cons...Cons•Fingerprint sensor Dose not recognise sometimes, i tried to setup it again but had same issue. But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.• The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.•The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.• Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I’m noticing less lag. Just don’t get this phone for gaming the chipset isn’t good enough.Pros•Samsung is known for their Super AmoledScreen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.•On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn’t good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it’s average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.•LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.•This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you’re heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.So overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using  social media...If you’re heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn’t for you. So if you don’t play graphics demanding games on your phone you will like this phone....\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I use my phone for almost around 18 hrs in 24hrs!! I don't know if the heating issue is due to that or not. But its getting heated up after using it for few mins. If you have your phone idle for sometime it cools down but then the instant you start to use it, it gets heated up. Can't have it over ear to speak on a call.PERFORMANCE : 4 starsCAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top. Being in bottom is so annoying that i couldn't place my phone over ground while on vid call.SCREEN CAST : Works perfectly. I tried with my Mi smart tv and its cool.Everything else is fine.Would be perfect if heating issue is fixed.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is its design. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is good. The battery 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support, 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with an AMOLED screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and Samsung Exynos 9611 processor, are some excellent feature of the Samsung Galaxy M31 Smartphone, which no other competitor is offering right now at this price point.after 7 days of uses:Phone design & look - 5/5Camera  - 5/5Performances  -5/5Display  - 5/5Battery  -5/5User interface  -5/5Sound  -5/5awesome phone\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don\\'t need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can\\'t use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and \"reduce animations\" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox securityDisplay: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experienceSound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that\\'s what Bluetooth speakers are for)Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that\\'s not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can\\'t sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Phone speed - goodCamera - Very GoodBattery - Huge but device consumption is perhaps highTouch - Smooth (Better than Xiaomi and Realme)Cons - Person on other side while on call complains of a bit low voice. (Remember to turn off wifi calling for better voice. But even than voice on other side is not good)Back is plastic and not glass like other modern phone of this segment.Samsung launched it at cheaper price. Perhaps revised rates after some time.Overall - Good mobile. Will give you better feel than Xiaomi or Realme.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The Box Contents :The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related PapersFirst Impressions :The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.After a week usuge:1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30sAs a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  After using the Samsung Galaxy M31 with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage for more than 2 months, I list following pros and cons:A. Pros1. Very good display quality. Watching videos is a delightful experience2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast4. Apps load quickly as expecteB. Cons1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of \"fast charging\", which is very disappointing.Overall the phone is very good and highly recommended.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Samsung M31Reviewing this after one and half month of using this mobile.Pros1. Display is excellent2. Light weight ( though having 6000MAh battery)3. Battery life is good can use for 9 hours continuously with single charging4. No heating, No lagging overall performance is good5. Dual SIM slot ( both supporting LTE) and dedicated memory Card slot is given6. Camera performance is really good specially the Macro feature.Cons1. Charging takes lot of time about 3hrs to get fully charged.2. Mobile Speaker sound quality is not that goodFeedbackI think with this price range Samsung is providing decent features and this is the best mid range mobile phone available in the market. Samsung is actually improving it's performance.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I used moto g 5 plus for 3 years before this. After having extensively used Samsung m31 for two days I am in love with the software as well as its hardware. There's tonnes of features in this OS optimised by Samsung. There's redmi note 8 users in my house and I can tell you that those phones are absolute Sh!t in front of m31. This phone may not come with features like punch hole display, in screen fingerprint sensor but after having used this I don't miss those features. I hate notches on phones but the one on this is great and doesn't disturb the functionality of display. Great phone to buy overall. And bonus : this is not a Chinese spy phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am using this mobile since last two month and now I am giving true reviews.1. Battery is very good - 100 %2. Fingerprints is in the back side & sensitive (good) and sometimes it is not working (bad) - 80 %3. Camera is good enough & you have to adjust according to your needsneeds -100%4.

No software issues yetNegatives:Face recognition and finger print recognition are iffy.Front facing camera is not sharp at all. Looks like my 2008 computer built in webcamSamsung apps that can't be removed. (Why add bloatware that no one uses anyways?)Plastic body while Redmi has metal bodies at the same price pointStill, a great phone at this price. I keep hearing rumors about how Samsung phones slow down after a few years, I'll see if that's the case and update this review accordingly. But right now, I do recommend buying it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Update: 03Jun2020Visited Airtel store today and the customer care exec told me that all new phones autimatically switch to WiFi calling for better call quality.But I disagree.  Given the fact that WiFi calling is disabled in system settings, how can it be automatically switched to Wi-Fi calling?Still stuck. Samsung... Please help... Honour the phones system settings.-----First Review:The phone is very good in everyday usage.The only problem faced is that the phone automatically switches to WiFi calling while making or receiving a call despite turning off WiFi calling. The network is Airtel.This results in a situation where once the call starts, data gets switched off. No internet connectivity. So cannot talk and connect to internet simultaneously.Am writing this after a lot of googling to find a fix for this.The phone has April 1 2020 patch applied.Can Samsung or anyone out there help fix this problem?Also let me know if it is an Operator related issue (please mention what the operator needs to fix) so I can talk to the concerned.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Soo this phone is good to buy. It has a decent processor. It has great battery life. Its camera quality is a little bit low in low light or medium light but great in daylight. Selfie camera is great better than most of the phones in this budget range. I have seen some lags in this phones.....not much but still. Best thing is that i can move my apps from internal storage to sd card as most phones not allows this thing. It doesn't heat much even at games like Fortnite or pubg. Speakers are good but in headphone u got dolby atmos support which makes experience of listening music games in headphones great.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  For camera:Change lens to 64 mp in camera setting. Change camera resolution to fhd or uhd.Using macro requires a little bit of understanding.Battery has 3 modes always keep on medium amd check the optimised button. While sleeping keep it on maximum.These are the issues people are facing because they have not fully set their phones.Now,The camera is genuinely amazing. Night shot are extremely well colored and aren't dull.Processor - the exynos 9611Simply put it resembles 675AIE in performance than the 722 AIE. So, that's one factor you need to consider.What does it mean?It means playing  PubG in ultra graphics will be a problem. Just that, at the extreme frame rate the phone will not be able to do it.Note:only at extreme frame rate dies the phone sort of fails.For everything else the maximum RAM usage is 4.2 and then under device care ckean your RAM. Also set the time to automatically clean your phone.Samsung UI is extremely good. It resembles stock android and the bloat ware is not annoying.Screen is next level. sAMOLED screen does its job.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Battery takes nearly 5 hours to charge completly.... Wen compared to other phones with fast chargers which can complete 100% in 1 hour ...so in 5 hours we can chargr 5 times  completly other phonez....in this genration waiting for 5 hours to complete for battery to charge is really big mistake by samsung..... Touch sensitivity  is Also poor and performanece is also not good\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Camera quality could have been upgraded. Evin though its 64MP, in low light  this is useless. Pic and video quality us bad in low light.Battery too doesn't last as for long. My Vivo U10 BATTERY performance is better compared to M 31 also the video and pic quality at night too is good if you compare it to M 31.The reason I purchased is because of the name Samsung. I somehow feel dissatisfied and disappointed.Price is ok and inbuilt memory is good.Have been using it from mid March 2020. Certain observations....a) twice the mobile restarted on it's own.b) heating issues when charging.c) on two occasions the mobile took around 6 hours to charge (100%).\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Fingerprint reader : perfectly fast enough.Battery life: Awesome.Camera quality: Best in this price range.Ram: 6gb so will do the job perfectly.Gamers: Not the best but can play wellOverall rating in 9/10\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India . I ordered on the online and happy. I am writing review after 10 days of usage,Pros:- Android 10! Beautiful looks!- Super AMOLED Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 MAH battery is fully charged time 3 hrs and Normal usage 2 days . Fast charging with 15W charger- 64 GB storage is 49 GB Available and Memory card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Mobile speakers sound is good.  earphone average quality not HD Voice.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good -  Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is goodCons:- Body is made of plastic like material- Not that thin, but ok.-Earpiece average quality not HD Voice.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Its been over 3 months now with this phone. Some highlights :1. super amoled screen- probably the best display in the 11 to 20 k rupees segment, hands down. Much needed if are like me and you read alot on kindle etc. Having used an amoled once, won't go opt for other screens ever!2. Free VPN with Samsung max, so better privacy3. Its Made in India, and the ultimate profits go to South Korea, where samsung is headquartered (not China).4. A pretty low Sar value. So a much safer phone than its competitors, especially Chinese brands, in terms of the amount of radiation u are exposed to.5. Battery life is not that great as they proclaim to be, but it's still good.6. The camera is pretty good in this price range, and the front camera also does its job pretty well. (Tip- you need to change snge the default resolution of the camera to 64 mp to utilize the full power of the lens. Many people don't do this, and then they write bad about the camera)7. A fast charger- thought not as fast as other high end phones, the charger is a good improvement from standard chargers in this price range.8. Much more reliable than Chinese brands, and rest assured, they won't steal your data and won't snoop on you.What it doesn't have - an IR blaster, But that's not a big deal.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  No Regret Mobile Phone. Samsung has improved a Lot. I have used till Note 10 & shifted to iPhone. I bought this M31 to gift to my wife. I am amazed to see the wow 😮 Performance of this M31. Stunning 64MP Quad camera to document your life, immersive viewing with 16.21cm (6.4\") Infinity-U Display, 6,000mAh battery and 15W Fast Charging. Superb Battery Life. Camera is little disappointing if you enlarge . But overall at this price range this is a wonderful phone you should buy. I will mark it 9/10. Go for it in this budget. Made in India 🇮🇳 Love it 😍\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It is the best phone for the budget from a brand lik samsung all though there is small flaws lik the main 64mp cam is a wide angle lens which looks a bit odd wit a slight fish eye effect and in low lighting it produces lot of noise but u get good detailing and the colour reproduction is amazing and lastly the processor could hv been even better i feel its not that its bad now but still could hv been better overall i rate an 8/10 for the mobile and s 1 more thing u should be aware of is that it doesn't support Samsung pay and Knox. Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ✌️ continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I had high expectations on Samsung M31, but after  using  for about  one week I find it not very impressive. I'm writing  this honest  review as per my observations.Pros -1. Display is very good.Cons -1. Charging takes too long, from 30% to 100% charging, it took more than 2 hours.2. In regard to battery lasting, I don't  find much differencebetween my old realme 3 pro which has 4045 mah and this phone which is claimed to have 6000 mah battery. I have to charge everyday.3. Most irritating is while attending calls in our ears it automatically goes to onhold mode and also call recording  starts automatically while placing the phone in our ears though automatic setting is off. Samsung should really work with this issues and correct the software options during calls.4. Finger and eyes sensor is not so swift like my old realme 3 pro.5. Main Camera is also not very impressive upon comparing  my old phone but yes front camera  for Samsung M31 is better.I hope Samsung  will soon correct all these issues.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I got a 8Gb 128Gb variant. The phone is great value for money. I'm sure everyone's read the specs and are looking for more user experience insights, so here goes mine. I wanted to buy a phone which gets latest security patch updates at least for the next 2-3 years (else my office mail doesn't work). I also wanted one that was made in India and owned by an Indian entity. A phone meeting both requirements doesn't exist. So the next best option is a good phone (security  patch) made in India by an entity that does not have a Chinese owning entity. Options were Panasonic (Jap) and Samsung (Kor). I've used Samsung phones before so went for this which had the following pros:1. Made in India2. 6Gb/8GB RAM3. 64/128 Gb ROM4. Fast processor (handles heavy apps with ease)5. Smart finger print sensor with notification scroll feature6. Awesome battery backup7. Nice pics for this price8. Amazing display9. Great sound quality, enhances the music experience on external speakers too.10. Auto disable screen timeout when face detectedThere may be many more features I don't use.. but I'm a typical person mostly using for work and some web surfing. I don't play games so don't know.On cons (explaining why I gave 3 stars) is only one.. the first phone delivered started shutting down on its own after a day. I quickly raised a replacement request and I got a new one and that's working great but the hassle of having to do all that is not nice.  I also read that this issue is there a lot. So Samsung needs to take note and fix this.Otherwise awesome phone guys 15-20k range, this is by far the best phone. And it's made in India!! :) go for it guys!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g.

In terms of connectivity, the Galaxy M31 offers 4G Volte network, dual-SIM, USB Type-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and A-GPS with GLONASS.Design• Decent looks and build quality - very similar to the Samsung Galaxy M30s, with a a unibody polycarbonate design, and glossy finish on the back panel - the only major difference is the camera module which now packs a fourth camera• The plastic body keeps the phone feeling relatively lightweight at 191 grams, which is mighty impressive for a phone packing a big 6000 mAh battery• It also feels great to hold with a seamless curved panel that meets the display up front• Modern, Infinity-U front - bezels around the screen are slim, except for a slightly thick chin - you still get around 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, which is great• Fingerprint sensor at the back is easy to reach• The power button and volumes are quite flush with the frame which means they lack that tactile, clicky feel• Design feels a bit dated and underwhelming, there is no spark in Galaxy M31\\'s design as we see in other brand\\'s phones like Xiaomi and RealmeDisplay• Gorgeous, 6.4-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with excellent viewing angles, and brightness levels - easily one of the best displays in the price bracket• It also comes with \"Widevine L1\" certification, which helps stream content in crisp HD resolution• Blacks are deep on the AMOLED display, which looks good with Night mode enabledSoftware• Samsung\\'s OneUI is today one of the more clean, refined Android UIs that\\'s especially well optimised for large displays like this• One UI also brings in other useful stuff, like a System-wide Dark mode (which turns the background completely black, and looks great on the M30s\\' AMOLED display), and Always On Display option\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Okay so writing the review after using the product for 23 days..the product is good overall but there are many things i would like to mention here...first of all if u r a xiomi mobile user don't go for this one because it is not at all easy to use devices when it comes to its features compared to xiomi ..you have to install music player,app lock separately and in the applock of samsung u cannot hide notifications of particular apps...camera quality is really not satisfying as it says it is 64 mp camera...coming to battery life i would say it is good ..if phone is 100% charged then it survies for 8 to 9 hours of use...and if you use phone moderately it can survive for 12 hours max..i don't know phone has screen recording feature or not as i am unable to find it till now...it has a bit of heating issue i must say..my phone got hang for 5 to 7 minutes today itself and not even power button was working..setting is quite confusing or i may say not easy to use...i hope in next update they will make it better..Now coming to pros of the phone...even being 6000mah battery it gets charged comparitavely to other phones..speakers are awesome...fingerprint sensor works too quickly...camera captures good pictures in dim light also..processor is fantastic as it works without taking any time even if u are working on many apps at a time...\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The phone is generally OK. Good Camera..Long battery Charge.Incoming SMS blocking is one of the important provisions in any smart  phone.But in M31, this is partially missing.SMS coming with a phone number only can be blocked. SMS coming without a phone number and coming with names of the business group can not be blocked. This is a great shortfall.Informed to the Help center through WhatsApp chat. They assured that this shortfall will be corrected in their next update. Till the next update we have to live with the disturbance of unwanted SMSs.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Overall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.after five month of usage till now I won't change my opinion one of the best mobile in this segment. But now Samsung  m31 s is the best competition but SAR value is very low in this mobile. Samsung is best one.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Well 5 stars to Amazon delivery and service team.The phone I received had some issues with voice quality. It had a weird vibration and echo that use to come while talking. And calls did go blank in between. Not a network issue as I tried using multiple sim.They scheduled a replacement after a technician visit. Same issue persisted. So may be its defect in the make.Camera quality was pretty average. Pictures in day light were decent. Under low light the quality is horrible.Battery life of the 1st model I received was good. Charged pretty fast too. The second one had issues of heating up and battery hardly lasted for 12 hoursWell here it took longer for the refund but have to give starsto the support team at Amazon who kept up the follow up till we got a resolution. Really happy with both the customer service agents who helped in the process.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Sometimes finger sensor doesn't work like A series.. means if ur finger r little wet it doesn't work properly . But I love this mobile , after many search I choose it and it is best as per my choice. Camera is good for orginal photography, samsung always captures the original picture not like realme or MI type extra brightness.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Camera is good, call quality is good but the other person's voice can be heard outside even though the volume is low, when you are on call, which is a flaw in samsung phones.Speaker quality when you are speaking from a distance, in WhatsApp video calls is not good. I tried this with MI and they are much better.The major drawback is the claim made by Samsung about fast charging. Only 35-40% gets charged in one hour. So it takes almost 3 hours for full charge. I had Motorola G5 Plus which charged 60-65% in one hour, which means full charge in 1.5 hours.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  After using 1 month, 6GB-64GB varient, Black colourPros:●Good Battery. I am a bit heavy user, still end of the day (6am to11am)40% Remains. I chatted for 3 hours and it sucks 5%battery only. Thats damm cool.●UI is very smooth and handy.●Screen quality is just awsome.●No heating issue in normal Usage. I have tried 13 apps running in background.(no gaming apps)●Fingerprint reader is fast but face detection is not so fast though its good.Cons:●Cam quality is not up to the mark. It has 64MP, still edge detection is not that perfect. My earlier mobile was Nokia 6.1Plus which has 16MP cam, still I find that better. Hope a soft update can fix this.●I prefer stock android, ANDROID ONE...anyway This UI is also good.● Mobile heats while gamming. This is not a gamming phone. Though I didn't play PUBG or Freefire or CALLofDUTY. Still it heats.. so no question of playing those games.●Charging time is too long and it don't support fast charging. 15w charger in the box and it takes nearly 2 to 3 hrs to charge this phone 0 to 100... I even tried it with Dash Charger(1plus).. still the result is same.. it has long battery so I will not complain about this as I charge it at night.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Improved a lot...I bought Samsung M30 while an year ago and very disappointed with the product especially from mob gaint SAMSUNG. Now with M31 model Samsung improved a lot comparing to the M30  In terms of performance and design and External Speaker( Above Avg than Avg). Camera segment  as well.After usage of 1 month here are pros and cons.Pros -Display Quality 4.5 / 5Performance - 4 / 5Heating  - 4.5/ 5Battery - 4 / 5Weight 4.5 / 5Network Coverage - 4 / 5Cons -Majorly, External Speaker ( Above Avg) in short not bad or not good.. ( Samsung have to focus on speakersstill on these models) 3 / 5No Fast charging support ( it takes 2.5 - 3 hours for full charge) 3 / 5Design/Build - 3.5 / 5Overall, have to say tremendous improvement in their SAMSUNG products and giving very tough competition to other flagship models.Of course great thanks to Seller and amazon as usual for sending this..hassle free process.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  To be frank!! I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung  must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery  The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI  Apart this the mobile is good one who are not students if you are a student to buy this you are must be a normal users not heavy users\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  You will get handset, charger , usb cable, and ejector pin in the pack.Fingerprinted reader fast.Battery life good.Screen color good.Camera good. You need to select 64mp to use camera in 64mp mode by default it set to lower resolution.Top side of Phone getting too much heated while in video call , or while using camera video recording.I called amazon support , they asked to do factory reset but no change.Playing YouTube video at 480p phone temp reaaches 42 degree.Wifi very weak, not receiving signal from my v380 CCTV.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I'm reviewing this phone after using it for nearly two months. I bought this phone as a temporary replacement to my flagship. I'm actually very impressed by the price to perfomance ratio of this device. The biggest USP of this phone is its OS. Samsung's OneUI 2.0 has improved tremendously in reducing bloatware and managing RAM efficiently.  It multitasks with ease. The battery life is fantastic. I'm putting my device to charge every alternate day, the screen on time is at least 9-11 hours depending on the intensity of the usage. The Camera quality is great, not outstanding. The speaker is loud and clear. It has Dolby Atmos audio drivers for external audio devices. The call clarity is excellent from both ends. The rear camera does a great job but the front camera doesn't live up to the expectations. It smoothens the images taken from the front cam, not sure if it's because of the sensor or if its in the software. Since it's a budget phone I don't think it would be fair to expect a lot.  I'm not much of a mobile gamer so I never actually tested it in that aspect. The overall build quality is good, looks premium but the entire body is made of plastic. It nearly takes 150 mins to charge to a 100% with the 15W factory charger. The speed doesn't change even if you use a charger of higher capacity. Coming to the conclusion,  I feel this is the best budget phone considering the price and brand value of Samsung. It does its job perfectly and I'll definitely recommend this phone.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.As per suggestion I updated phone immediatelyThe look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.Once this phone restarted on its own.Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.After 3 months, I experience the hanging once every week.Gets heat up a lot on video calls of WhatsApp, Zoom and Duo calls and restarts automatically.So overall, not recommended.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is my 4th Samsung mobile device having used different models over the years starting from Wave series.M31 is a definite buy if you are a heavy mobile user where battery, call quality and connectivity is priority.+ Battery has lasted me for more than a complete work day with approx 4hrs of talktime over 50 audio calls over mobile network, 5hrs mix of Microsoft audio call, Google meet audio call, atleast 30-40mins of what's app chatting throughout the day and almost an hr of social media including audio & videos with GPS always ON.Charging is pretty fast.Battery: 10/10+ speed of device which has been brilliant in multi tasking and switching between appsPerformance: 8/10+ support for airtel wifi callingConnectivity: 9/10Camera was never a priority for me however is pretty decent.Camera: 8/10What I didn't like is the bloatware that gets installed from Samsung Galaxy store. That's bit of a pain.OS Software: 5/10\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Premium phone for a great price.The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display with 2340x1080 pixel resolution. The display is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top.Samsung Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 operating system topped with the company’s own layer of One UI 2.0. The user interface is quite clean and the large app icons give a nice look to the device. There is also an app drawer where users can hide all the apps and can keep the home screen clutter-free. Like other Samsung smartphones, this one also comes preloaded with all the usual Samsung apps along with some third-party apps such as Facebook, Amazon, Snapchat, and others. Samsung has not included Bixby in the Galaxy M31 and along with this the Bixby Vision app is also missing from the device. The device also comes with Digital Wellbeing and Parental Control options which array of usual gestures. For instance, users can double-tap to wake the device and users also have an option to hide the three-button navigation layout and use full-screen gestures to control the smartphone.The camera is one of the major updates which comes with the Galaxy M31. The Galaxy M30s has a triple rear camera, while the Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup. The rear camera of the device comprises 64MP main sensor, 5MP macro camera, 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. On the front, you will find a 32MP selfie camera. The company claims that both the cameras are capable of recording 4K video. Samsung has also added Night Mode in the camera for better photography experience. Like always the Samsung camera app is pretty clean and easy to use and users can find different modes to shoot within the app. Along with this, the app also offers a toggle that allows users to switch between the primary and wide-angle lens cameras. There is also a Scene Optimiser present in the app, which quickly detects the scene and set up the camera accordingly. We were quite satisfied with the camera results of Samsung Galaxy M31. The device was quick to focus and also offered an ample amount of detailing in the images captured. Swinging on the wide-angle lens camera offers a wider field of view along with some really good images. However, we personally loved the macro camera which offered really detailed images. The images captured in daylight were better as compared to the ones taken indoors. The Night Mode incorporated in the device also does a reasonably good job and it reduces noise from the images taken during the night. The 32MP selfie camera does a satisfactory job as both the selfies taken indoor and outdoor turned out to be good.6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. Unlike other smartphone makers, Samsung has included a fast charger within the box. We were able to get through the day of mixed usage with a single charge, courtesy the powerful battery Samsung has packed in.The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you. The smartphone comes under the budget segment but it doesn’t look like one.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This was bought for my father. He was v skeptic buying this. We got this for 20,500 on emi. The phone reached in proper condition. The phone comes only with a charger & a pin to open the sim slot. What surprised me is that, no screenguard is already on it and we have to purchase one seperately. I already bought a flip cover for the phone which is doesn't actually do the guarding of screen for minor scratches. Samsung should pre apply a screenguard to smartphones, 20,500 phone and is not a small amount too. We checked the phone everything was good. The camera quality is sub-par. I am not impressed with the can quality. The music is playing well. All ok. Nothing wow about this phone.. just glad it will serve the purpose for my father. Will edit this review once I find out how is the phone working actually.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Disappointing. Can\\'t get worst than this. Firstly received a faulty phone which never got switched on. I did not have option to return, only replacement was available. It took additional 9 days for the replacement to reach me that too after multiple conversations and \"so called\" inspection and all. After all this when I got the phone which was fortunately in working condition, I\\'m not at all happy with the output1- finger recognition is not very good, you have to tap hard.2- Face direction doesn\\'t work on multiple accounts.3- phone takes forever for charging. How can they not provide fast charging in the phone of today\\'s generation?4- phone is extremely slippery. Impossible to use without cover.5- speaker volume is pathetic.6- camera quality is okay okay.7- picture quality is pretty good.I will not at all recommend this phone. I\\'m sure samsung was able to sell huge number of handsets but they are only trying to ride on anti-china notion going on currently. Since there are very less option if you do not want to buy Chinese phone, many would buy m31. However, this phone more look like \"something built in hurry in an effort to deliver at comparatively lower price but without much R&D\". Dear Samsung, I was not expecting this from you. We deserve better, you owe us better.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I will divide the review between pros and cons so as one can make informed choicePros:1. Camera creates stunning images.2. performance is good, though not checked any games.3. UI is really well designed, lot of customization available, need to skim through the settings.Cons:1. The battery lasts 1o hours with continuous hotspot ussage OR One and half day with normal internet and mobile usage.2.  Supplied 15W charger takes approx 2.30 to 3 hour to fully charge the phone.3. Camera Video artificial light performance is not good and get worse if slow motion mode is used.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Obverall performance is best. Samsung is Samsung.  Even better than socalled redmi series. Its display and dolby atmos sound is awesome. Main is speaking clarity over call which is supab. Battery life goes upto 2 days even after using it as hotspot device for my smart TV for more than 6 hrs. primary 32 mp camera takes gr8 pics. I won't say rear camera is not good. It is also gr8. But u can't use flash in 64 mp setting.  Fingerprint sensor and face unlock do its job well. Fast charge takes 2 and half hr to full charge from 10%. But I prefer more slow charger as that will increase battery life. And remember it has non removable battery. So why to worry if it takes 4 hrs to full charge. Overall go for it without thinking for alternate.But one problem, seller didn't supply ejection pin with the mobile. I don't want to return as mobile is superb. But seller must check such mistakes before delivery. For someone he may forget to send charger or even mobile. I would expect that delar to send the ejection pin seperately as I won't get it from market.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Yeah after 15 days of usage..heres my review about samsung galaxy m31PROS1.Amoled display of course the (best in midrange smartphones.)2.camera quality is awesome u must know fully about it and use.(I have attached a couple of shots.)3.Mega battery (lasts one day even if u do 5 hrs of gaming and 2 hrs of watching videos).4.Brand resale value of Samsung.5.Processor is fantastic for everyday usage and good for gaming.6.unexpectedly fingerprint  sensor works so good.CONS1.Stereo speakers are not so loud..they are just aaudible.2.Not a glass back just a polycarbonate body.3.Its an internet model and back covers are not available though im nt a backcover user but i tried finding some in the local market.4.Only two colour options.5.charging takes 2 and half hours to completely charge the device.6.some heating issue when using wifi.FINAL VERDICTThis is an awesome mobile from samsung that competetes with the likes of poco x2 and newly launched moto fusion plus.If u love an perfect brand to buy which gives  regular updates to keep the phone upto date then defintely go for it.😁\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Among the range of below 20K, this is the Smartphone, everyone should blindly go with buying without any second thought.It has the needed Elegant look, amazing screen display, camera, battery, Classy feel, etc. JUST GO FOR IT!! This phone has everything that I expected. Battery lasts for 2 days with normal use, listening to music for couple of hours a day including watching a whole movie on prime.Check the detailing of the camera took in the dark in the pic uploadedI have also recommended to my friends and families, and post me I have made them buy too :)\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  After 1 month usage, here is my review.I had been using Moto for years now but got fed up with not up to date build quality and poor performance. I am also not comfortable with UI that is far from stock android, so didnt give the chinese phones a look. So M31 was my best option.Samsung One UI with Android 10 is an absolute pleasure to navigate.6GB RAM is more than enough with 3.5 GB always available without any apps open.It multi tasks with ease.Screen is AMOLED Full HD and it completely blew your mind as a first time AMOLED user. The difference between AMOLED and normal screen is astounding. Once you get used to it, you won't be able to go back to normal screen. Best Display on a budget phone hands down.I was discouraged by other reviews saying Exynos processor is not good. However I have had no problems with it. Ofcourse if you compare its benchmarks with Snapdragon, it falls behind but that does not make it a bad processor. But trust me, looking at it alone, it is good with no problems. I haven't encountered any stutter or lag till now. Even gaming like Call of Duty and PUBG is perfect with medium settings. Ultra high drops some frames but that is expected of a budget phone. And anyway, gaming experience is perfectly fine on medium settings.Haven't yet tested camera with the lockdown going on but for normal user like me, I found it to be of good quality.Battery is a behemoth and easily lasts 1.5 days with normal usage. with 1-2 hours gaming, I need to charge it only once every morning.Because of battery its slightly on the heavy side but you wont notice because weight distribution is excellent. Feels extremely nice to hold. I strongly recommend getting a cover as the back is glossy and picks up a ton of smudges. That's the only con I experienced.Having used Moto G series and Moto X series in the past, I can safely say this is the best budget smartphone I have brought till date. Phones with specs like this used to cost 30-40k 2 years back. Absolute steal.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  For the price this phone has really surprised me in the camera department! The shots come out really good n detailed..the only big disappointment is the processor..even with 6gb ram the phone still feels sluggish like a 3gb ram phone...lags time to time..typing slows down..if you are a really fast typer you might notice it..battery charging speed is decent it fits the price range..display is beautiful..another big plus point..vivid mode on the warmer side gives out nice vibrant colours..speaker is average..I'd suggest you put in a few extra bucks n go for the 8gb variant as more ram will help run the apps smoother and may cause less lag.4/5* for this!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Simple and straight:Pros:- Battery- Display clarity, bcz it\\'s Amoled and also the size- Enough speed according to it\\'s configuration. Mine is of 6gb RAM- UI, i used Mi before and thought it was the best UI till i started using this. This ONE UI is too good but will let you know about Flaws in \"Cons\"- This one for Amazon, i purchased it with exchange of my MI mobile bcz of the recent revolution, u know. The exchange value was very good, thanks to Amazon.Cons:- Fingerprint scanner sometimes is non-responsive, have to use power button to awake screen- There is no multi tasking windows available in this UI- Media volume is not loud enough, Bass lovers can\\'t have enough loudness when playing music- No IR blaster, which is very useful, Samsung should provide atleast in future- No LED indicator for notificationThese are what i observed and mentioned as per my experience, may be useful especially for anyone going purchase or Samsung and for Amazon. Basing on these, you can consider your priority. Cons aren\\'t that big and few can be changed or updated. Finally I recommend for buy. It is a Good Mobile.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.Thanks!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Wonderful product!!Glad I bought this.It is more than 3 months now since I bought this phone!Battery life is excellent! I use my phone with wifi and data on with multiple apps running together. Even after 8hrs of use it consumes only  50 to 60 percent of the charge.Camera quality is also good.captures fine details well. The live focus is also quite good. For regular use and daily photography it is beyond sufficient.  I had seen few poor reviews about the camera, but it turned out good.The finger print reader is quick and responsive.Overall good value for money! With a sturdy back cover and a tempered glass it Is good to go.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  All are good but I don't think that 6000mah battery works like 6000mah ...battery life not up to the mark what I have desired ...samsung engineers must work on it .otherwise all things are perfect..compared to the price but those who say that 6000 mah battery goes for two days they are wrong  it works max 12 hrs on screen continuously but if u are not a hardcore user it works 1 day full. Those gyz who says in you tube that it works 1 and half day or two days ..that does not perfectly match with the reality.One more think charging time is very high u need 3 hrs to recharge it from zero to 100%. I don't have problem with the charging time but those who have problem with the charging time they may shift to a better option.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Best alternative for chinese phones by samsung . Not some major flaws but it would have been more great if there was a glass back than a plastic one but it's not that major flaw just put a good cover and  you are good to go. It has an good battery of 6000 mah and goes for 2 days straight . Camera is excellent . The combination of four cameras make the photo look awesome . The fingerprint reader is also good and fast . Samsung has given a seamless experience with stock android and no pre installed apps . I will recommend this phone to buy with closed eyes . Best phone under 20000 rs just go for it without further thoughts .\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Pros:Amazing Screen QualityOne UISamsung branding and serviceMacro PhotographyCons:Despite 6000mAh, I did not find it to be great. It was just good.Coming from an iPhone, I felt android phones' are way behind in Image processing techniques. Realized that pixel MP values are just to lure people and the real power of a camera lies in the Image processing.Rest everything is normal like every other phone.If you want to buy a Samsung 4GB RAM phone and macro photography doesn't matter for you, go for the M21. But If you are going for a 6GB phone, I would recommend you to spend those extra Rupees and get this M31.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Amoled display very Sharp and vivid.Battery life excellent ...hardly 30 to 40 percent battery down if you are moderate user and not playing continuous game.OS is smooth.CAMERA need to improve , need to check software upgrades but it's not too bad ,only we need to search for better software.Finger print reader is fast.Go for 6 GB and 128 GB option so no need to worry about space issue.9611 samsung equinox processor works well no lagging observed ( i am also using 1st time this processor ...otherwise I prefer SD processor).Charging require 3 hours to full charge..it is just 15 watts charger but dont worry battery performance is great so hardly need to charge.Samsung really pack monster under 20k ( Best price offered.)Best phone offered by Samsung....go for it👌\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Pros--1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT  CAMERA  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.3. 6000mah BATTERY  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.Cons--1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX  SECURITY  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.3. BUILD QUALITY  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.4. 15 WATT CHARGER  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.Note-1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.Pros:1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.Cons:1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  M31 is one of the best mid tier, made in India, \"budget smartphone\" out there right now for people looking for an upgrade from their entry level smartphones. The super AMOLED display, 6000mAh battery, 128 GB storage and a Samsung Exynos processor, that\\'s a little better from the top of the line 600 series Qualcomm Snapdragon line of processors are the strongest selling points. The UI occupies a lot of RAM, 1.8 GB on an average, and the battery performance isn\\'t mind-blowing, it\\'s great 1&1/2 days of usage easily (playing some games, watching YouTube for 3-5 hours), which you\\'d expect from a 6000mAh battery (I expected a little more). The camera is great, macro shots are well lit and crisp, 64MP main sensor senses colour pretty well, and the wide angle isn\\'t all that great, but it gets the job done, hyperlapse, slomo features are a great addition. Front facing camera is \"okayish\". The phone feels heafty and sturdy to the touch, and feels responsive overall, transitions to background apps are a bit jittery, but I believe it\\'s a UI issue, and not a performance issue. PUBG runs well, if you plan to play casually. Overall, I\\'ve been using this phone for over a month now, and I have no major complain. Totally recommend it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Before zeroing in on the Samsung Galaxy M31, I researched the smartphone market in India and tabulated the data in terms of specs. For those looking to not give their money to the Chinese who are using the money to attack our country, among the Non-Chinese smartphones, the M31 presented the most bang-for-buck on paper.The M31 really good in every department, including in its massive 6k mAh battety, its AMOLED display, Android 10 OS, 6GB of RAM, 128GB ROM, Samsung's slick UI.At the sub 20K price range, the phone is an excellent buy.For photographers though not so much since it does not fully support CAM2API. Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k. The 6z supports shooting in RAW as well, unlike the Samsung M31.For the regular Joe though, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a pocket friendly Non-Chinese phone option that is compelling.Amazon's delivered 1 day ahead of schedule.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Camera clarity is same as 48mp in Redmi note 8. There is no difference. 5MP macro is very waste comparing with 2MP macro in Redmi note 8 (better) and I am Very much upset that in this price range samsung is not providing the clarity  and IR blaster which is not included.  One more thing I don't know why Samsung is not providing headphones now, there is no back case or screen guard.  Please try to include.Not satisfied with CAMERA @ 64MP rear and 34MP Front..  these figures are just for mentioning only but not providing actual clarity.And one more thing..This product is not a scratch proof glass/ Corning gorilla glass. Scratches has happening continuous while putting in the pocket.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  amazing handset in price segment, great features, most and important is don't want to by MI as its origin from Virus country, I feel my contribution towards India and exchange MI with this device.I insist to all great Indians, never by from Virus country and replace or return if you own it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Honestly I Like Samsung M31 so much that one by one I buyed total 3 Mobiles and two of my friends also buyed after getting a good feedback from my end, Camera quality is so awesome, shared few clicks above clicked by my samsung M31, main screen have a full coverage,  battery back is just just awesome I mean it has a very good battery backups, mobile processing, camera quality, multiprocessoring and internet make up feel like not to apart from your Samsang M31.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I purchased this phone for my dad. But i used it for 4-5 days. And on that basis i can say that:• The performance of the phone is very smooth. I don't find any hanging problem.• The battery life of this phone is amazing. If you are using your phone without internet then the battery life works for 3-5 days.• The camera quality of the rear is nice but front cam is not up to that point. It's like you are using front cam with an beauty editor.• As you all know about the screen, it's just awesome.• And other functions of the phone starts properly.Before purchasing this phone. I compared it to many of the smartphones. And trust me this tops at first in this range. So, if your budget is around 15000 u can go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I really disappointed with this choice I made,I am writing this feedback after using 21 days ,Pros:1)Light weight2) Android 10.03)User interface is good4)Asthetic5) quick finger print readerCons:1) build quality is not good2) camera really sucks3)I don't know when samuang will stop using Exynos processor n start using Snapdragon,4) Ram manangament is not that good comapre to other mid range phones5) 15W is not enough6) Simple, just Auto Rotate option has not givenWhen you drop down the menu7) though it is 6000mAh, batery life comes  just 1 day though not heavy user\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I purchased a Black 6/64 varient on 4th May and in 3 weeks I can confirm that I regret purchasing an iphone 7plus worth 62 thousand that too 3 years ago.I am not a user who will zoom a picture and compare the pixals, honestly, is that needed? You dont really zoom pictures more than your phone's size so why make the hype.About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use.Somewhere I also feel that this phone provides me more features than ios 13. I don't really miss charging my iphone twice a day lol\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.9. Headphone is not given with phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I received this on 20 March 2020.I have used Redmi note3 , Redmi note4 and micromax yurekha before coming to One Plus 7T. My experience so far with this:1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. But this one is Mind blowing and amazing. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. Amazing Camera3. Battery: One of the best from Samsung mobiles. I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5. After using my previous mobiles, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight.6. i don't have any Complaints on this phone. Finally I love Samsung Galaxy M31.Go for it guys !! You won't regret. My rating 4.5/5.. :)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Excellent product. Worth buying it.Pros:Massive 6k battery. Goes on and on.4 rear cameras with the main one at 64mp.Excellent front cam.Blue color looks stunning.S amoled screen with always on display.Finger print and face unlock work superb.Android 10.Cons:Limited bloatware, Samsung apps, which can be disabled at least which is good.Back panel absorbs fingerprints easily. Needs frequent cleaning.Doesn't come with an earphone. You can buy one outside per your choice.Suggestions:Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.Never look at M30 or M30s. You get M31 for the same price with much better camera.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Gifted this to my Bhabhi and she finds it really nice. Been a month and she is happy with the performance.I personally want that camera in any phone has to be nice. I really love the camera and inbuilt filters as well.Very easy to operate. No rocket science. Anyone can easily access. Even my 2 years old niece also opens YouTube and photos easily. 🤣😜Very good buy for the price you gave. Prefer it over other brands because of its features and reviews I read before buying.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  A complete mega Monster.  This phone brings back Samsung in competition with the Chinese brands which has captured the market share in recent years.Before writing this review, let me tell you'll a short brief on my requirements and background. I'm middleaged,  working professional from Mumbai and my requirements were basic usage with some multimedia at the EOD. And I'm not a gamer. This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this,  I've been using A popular known brand and model,  Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming.  And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Best thing about this Mobile is the BIG Battery & of course the Display is Top Notch.~ For Gaming also mobile fine, some say exynos is not that good vs Snapdragon chipsets but after using for 1st time i would say, not at all disappointed, because see if u can play Pubg in High settings and there not much heat then what else do you need, though there seems to be some lagging issue in higher settings for PUBG Graphics but basic & ultra settings works perfectly 👌.~ No issues with Sims (Airtel/ Jio)~ Best Display i have ever used (AMOLED)~ Sound quality also very good with speaker & also with earphones, atleast way better than my previous mobile (Moto X 4)~6000 Mah BATTERY ❤️ can't beat that with this price seriously 💯 easily works for whole day, on normal use u may get 30% on next day too,My location, Bluetooth, is always on for fitness band so with all these + fb, YouTube, insta , regular browsing, WhatsApp, pubg for 2-3 hours, i still get 25 - 35% at the night or next day morning, this is the best thing about this Mobile (Full Paisa wasoool hai 💯)~ 6gb Ram is quite good- nowadays u need atleast 6gb for smooth working, i haven't seen any hanging issues till now even after rough use believe me~ ONE UI 2.0 : I normally prefer clean stock android phones like Motorola, all my previous phones were from Motorola but u know it sucks now so wanted buy mid range with near clean stock android phone, so this my 1st Samsung Mobile, earlier i never liked Samsung because of there UI, but with ONEUI all is fine u get android 10 with all the Google features.~ Performance is also goodOverall i would definitely recommend this Mobile at this price range (i got this for 15,999)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Believe me guys this is the best overall package u can get under 18k i have just brought a 64gb variant from amazon at 16k and trust me guys it exceeded my expectationsFirstly lets talk about the cons or negative points of the phone1. The polycarbonate back is a fingerprint magnet and is quite slippery applying a cover is  Highly reccomended2. The glass on the front is highly fragile and gets easily cracked. So applying a tampered glass is necessary.3. The front camera performs very poor in low light4. The fast charging is enabled by default but the battery backup is around 9hrs but if i disable fast charging i could get around 12 hrs of screen on time again that is a good thing because u can just charge it at night as it takes around 4 and half hours to charge completelyNow lets talk about pros:1. Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is  way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devicesIn the competition3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.If u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I'm using my Samsung Galaxy M31 for more than a month and now reviewing it.Below are the details that I feel and have have experienced during my usage.- sAmoled display: The best display one can get in the price range. It truely give flagship phone like experience in mid price range phone.- Bettery: Single charge works for me for more than 1.5 day almost with 3-4 hours daily calls, 2-3 hours daily live streaming, 24 hours net connected. It gets 15W fast charge which takes almost 3 hours to charge this power house from less than 10% to full charge.- Camera: quad camera setup does it job well. 64MP Primary camera takes decent photos in day light. Live focus also works great. Macro is fine too. Ultra wide mode is also good. Though it has night mode but shows noise. 32 MP front camera is best in this segment.Processor: Exynox 9611 works absolutely fine for day to day life. I'm not a gamer so not sure about gaming performance. Apps open without any issue and don't feel any lag.UI: One UI also gives the best experience. It is very smooth and easy to use.The other good thing about this phone is that Samsung is providing McAfee security in this phone which no one will find in Chinese phones.So if you have the budget of 17-18k for new smart phone and want to get smooth and best experience in this price range, please go ahead and buy this phone. But if you less budget around 14k the go for Galaxy M21 in which one will get tri camera setup instead of quad in M31 and have 64GB internal memory which should also be sufficient and rest of the features list are same as M31.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Been 2 months using this phone. Overall performance is good. Went ahead and chose this product because didn't wanted to go for Chinese brands.Less rating because only after 2 month of use suddenly touch pad stopped working. Wend ahead forced power off/on it worked. But only to become unresponsive next morning. Immediately rushed to samsumg cerive center in Malleshwaram Bangalore. They checked and replaced entire touch and screen panel free of cost as it was under warranty.This might be one of rare case but it happened with my device only.All other features 5 star camera, battery and user experience.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Everything is better than expected. Just one thing can't resolve: JioCall app doesn't work. Though jio internet works, calls also are ok. Only app itself is not ok. I tried to check sim setting, mobile data settings, to restart the phone, everything - but nothing helps. Maybe there's no need of this app actually as soon as everything works without so it's ok.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Really great phone at a great price. I have been using since two months..runs smoothly without any lag. The best thing is the display. Amazing amoled display with true black which dramatically enhances the user experience and the infinite display is a plus.The camera is quite good. amazing picture quality with a good resolution. Front camera is quite good and convenient for video calls. 64 mp camera, along with wide angled camera are some cool featuresBut it becomes little bad when you zoom.. like water coloring... image processing can be improved. But is acceptable at this price. Dont expect picture quality like that of an iphone or a 30000 plus phone.Battery is good enough for me. As i use it only for calls and browsing and normal regular use like watching movies, YouTube...it gives a decent battery support and lasts upto 1 and  a half day. Not suitable for gaming purpose. Doesn't feel like 6000 mAh. Might be because of the Amoled display as each pixel actively consumes power. Although, black screen uses no power as compared to LCD, still Amoled consumes more power than an average LCD or LED display. Again, battery performance acceptable at this price when compared to the other cool features at this price.Fingerprint sensor works smoothly.And at last, amazing looks and i really like the ocean blue color and the sides are gradually blackened! Stunning looks.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am writing this with my experience of 10 days usage.Battery::I have used many models. Battery wise this is the best mobile I ever used. I use my mobile heavily (personal use, office use, video streaming, net browsing, gaming). For me it is giving 1 full day.Finger Print Scanner::Working accurately but little slow compare to Lenovo and honor mobiles.Camera::Camera is good but not up to the mark. Infact I have a disappointment on this section. Taking too much time to sharpen the picture. Difficult to take children photos. But overall is OKAY... It's camera is good in daylight but in low light conditions picture quality not good.Performance::I give you 5/5 in this section. All previous apps are being saved in memory while your phone put in rest aside. Fast and memory recollection is awesome.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  One of the best mobiles I have purchased.Pros: Amazing battery life as it has 6000 mAH battery.Awesome camera. Set it to highest quality if you dont mind space occupied 🙂.Capacity is 64GB which is pretty good.  However you have the option of having a 512 GB microsd Card. I intend to have 128GB card installed so that I can use it as an external drive of sorts 😀. Call quality is good and so is the internet speed handling. All in all very good mobile and I am quite happy using it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Nice display and battery backup. Don't expect perfomance. Good for candy crush level games. Processor is old. At this price today's competition you'll get better ones. Let's be honest. Camera is pathetic. No difference between 16 and 64 MP . I am not a 'mobile gamer' since this device can't do much in there. Also lots of bloatware by samsung. Unnecessary waste updates and apps. Only good things is the battery backup and display. Sound not so great. I don't know why they put a Dolby feature. No change in sound in headphones. Its a Dummy . Speaker an average performer.. Fanboys can suck it. No need to spend this much money for the crappy perfomance. I bought it for 17499 for 6 GB 128 GB variety. Body is cheap plastic. One of the worst kind .Glass breaks easily\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Hi guys,i brought  this phone on 6th march..I dnt know,hw to describe this device features.There is no  s passs,s secure folder and knox security, this is main reason for me. Even m30s also have tht feature.Back Camera is pretty gud ☆☆☆☆Front camera ☆☆☆Battery slow chrngng ☆☆☆Face lock v.v. slow (somtimes unable to recongnise) ☆☆Fingr print ☆☆☆I dnt think its a speed processor.☆☆☆Features ☆☆There is no knox,s secure folder, s pass, samsung pay, locking apps..I wsh i could sell this fr anyone.Totally im not satisfied with this device..☆☆☆\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Consider Other choices also.Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.No notification LED.Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  A big NO for gamers but simply awesome things are -1. of course the AMOLED Display.2. 6000mAh battery3. Main 64MP Samsung sensor with good image quality.4. wifi calling feature.5. dedicated SD Card slotBut some other facts to consider -1. in Pro mode camera 'shutter speed control' and 'focus control' is missing.2. Volume Rocker and power button are cheap plastic, although it gives good tactile feedback.3. have to very careful through the setup process, otherwise, you will get lots of unwanted notifications.4. you need a good protective cover to prevent scratches.5. Charger cable/Data cable, provided is short.6. u will feel Battery is taking so much juice to compare to snapdragon SoC, because of Exynos 9611 processor. but u 'll get 1.5-2 days of battery for normal usage.... I hope this will help u to decide before buying this phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Its been like more then 2 weeks since i am usig this phone with my primary sim.I have been testing all the features and usability this phone offers till this time and now i feel i can give my thoughts about this device.So lets make pointers:-Built: I feel the phone has amazing built Quality. Whereas Yes, the Plastic back won't feel much premium but it is actually much more practical then glass back phones. Yes it can scratch easily but who uses a phone without a cover as i would suggest to get a premium cover to get that premium feeling.Talking about Glass back phones it would be very costly to replace but the plastic shell of m31 would be much more cheaper.-Display: As you already knew its best under 20k segment. Better then other Amoled screen and No Crazy 120hz refresh rate but yeah it feels much better to use.-Software: I was using a stock android device previously and the experience of oneui is actually not bad its smooth and even fun to use. There are some hiccups here and there which is acceptable but one thing is that recent app menu lags alot while switching between apps ruining all the experience.It can be fixed via some software updates.Hardware: Phone is not heavy. The buttons are placed right, good quality buttons gives premium and positive feedback. Fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate too.-Camera: The camera quality is actually very good. All the cameras are quite usefull if you know how to use them. The Wide angle and macro camera is also good but implementation is not that great a software update can fix that too.For the night i can say that the shots are blur and grainy if you can use the camera properly then you can take some amazing shots like i do so for me the night camera is also good not great. Whereas some updates can do improvements to it.-Battery: Best battery life of any phone i have used till now. Yes the charging speed could have been better but the battery life is soo good that you will hardly rush for a charge.Note* first charge heats the device bad but after 2-3 days of usage it gets back to normal nothing to worry about. My device doesn't heatup now.My usage includes all day 2active sims, 50% brightness all day, wifi/data ON 24/7. 2hrs Gaming,1hr youtube,  Some calls, and all day social media.With a usage like this, my phone starting from 100% in the morning to 2nd day evening dropping to 25-30%. I never let my device go below that. Even the stand-by time of the phone is great.-Performance: Its fast and fluid. Whereas the ram management could be Better which can be fixed. No heating issue. Good for normal to heavy gaming. Overall the performance is Very Good of the device.This device is not specified for a single use. Its practically a straight forward device which allows the user to use it as a phone should be used. The phone doesn't offer any hanky panky Stuff for attention making anyone mad for games nor for tiktok.Verdict: If you are a rough user or you travel alot, if you are not a mad gamer then you can go for this device.It offers best practicality and usability thats how a phone should be.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  After using 1week I am writing this.First, I would like to thanks Amazon for their service, I got the phone before estimated deliver date.Design of the phone is good.Battery is just awesome. With a moderate use it is giving fully two days service.Camera is also awesome in this price range in both day and night mode. But it can't say as 64MP.There is no heating and lagging problem till now.Charging is very fast. But one thing I found as cons, it's network capturing quality is little worse as compared to Vivo mobile phones.  Otherwise it is a quality product. I would like to suggest everybody to go with this phone.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This phone is the best phone which we can buy currently especially when this is coming from a brand like Samsung1. The first thing is the screen which is very crisp and clear. Love watching movies on it.2. The processor is fast and one of the best in this price range.3. The battery which is 6000 mah even with a heavy phone usage will easily last you through the day and even more.4. The finger print reader works well.5. The camera is really good with great output all around.All in all, it ticks all the right boxes and you are guaranteed to enjoy this phone. A very easy recommendation for all.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The Samsung galaxy M31 is the best phone to buy under Rs.20.000 I purchased the samsung brand after gap of 2 years. The phone is worth buying for following reasons.1.Camera quality.(both front and back camera are awesome)2.Fingerpoint reader and face reader works very fast.3.The 6000mah Monster battery works for two days easily even for heavy user4.The super amoled screen in this price range is great.I strongly recommend this phone to all the buyers.Thank you SAMSUNG\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This is my first attempt with Samsung as my alternative phone number. I am a dedicated & loyal iPhone user since beginning but I can confidently say that it was definitely a very good buy. Excellent features, no way behind Apple, great look, back side finger sensor is of great help to easy opening of screen lock. I took some photos , same frames both with my iPhone 11 & Samsung M31. I can definitely say Samsung captured much better snaps in terms of depth, vividness, colour & clarity. Last but not the least , value for money. I must highly recommend.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  It takes more time to charge and mobile gets heated up easily . One of the worst products the samsung has manufactured so far. Really upset with the processor and battery life.  More than 3 hours of time it takes to charge up.one day battery. please dont purchase this product guys . Go for A series in samsung. Camera quality  is not as good as A series in Samsung & oppo. Fingerprint reader nice.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Awesome phone..I am writing  this review after using  the phone after more than 1 month. Both rear  and front camera is awesome  and quality of picture is good..it suport 4K videos..I am bit disappointed  on battery quality and charging ponit..It is not up to the mark on 6000mAh battery..It takes 3-4 hr to charge the full battery  and discharge within a day.If you will play game,it will discharge withi  10 hr.I am not playing games much,so I am satified but I won't support to buy this phone if you paly games all most of the time in a day.Also I am not happpy  on face recognition..I feel as It doesn't  support sometime..But overall it is a good phone.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Im writing this review after using it 20 days. I have received my phone on 8th March ,ordered on 5th march when the sell has started.when I took this in my hand ,feel very light weight if comparision to 6000mah mega battery, I watched a movie of 2hour and 5 mins and it consumed only 20% battery ,battery life is very great ,it runs approx 1 to 1and half day after full charge. Charging time is approx 140 minutes.Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up. Worth for money...\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smoothBattery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expectScreen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decentCamera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp camProcessor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This device is best...super fast performance with oxygen OS. Super Amoled screen is awesome.you will enjoy watching video or browsing.Battery is awesome ..it gives 24 hours of battery backup with full usage once full charged otherwise with moderate usage it gives almost 2 days of battery backup.Charging is quite slow and it takes 3 hours to get fully charged but it is worth for usage of 24 to 36 hours. Camera is also superb with super video UHD recording. By default it comes with 32 Mpixel but user can change to 64Mpixel and click awesome pictures. MUST Buy if looking for stunning device in this particular budget. I have used almost for a week and then reviewing it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have been using this phone for over a month now. I need to charge once every two days, which is a major time saver. COnnectivity is good. I used to have connectivity issues with my previous phone, which was a big botheration. There are only areas that I have a bit of a concern. 1. the width of the phone is a bit narrow which, because of my thick fingers creates some typing challenges. 2. I wish the charging cable was 0.5 meter longer.Overall a good phone.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This phone is truly fantastic in this price range.Am writing this review after using for a week.Pros:1. 6000 mah battery is really a monster.2. Camera is excellent.3. Touch sensitivity and fingerprint readers are very goodCons:1. Phone is hanging sometime while unlocking and sometimes while using apps. This might be due to software. I can this came be overcome through updates.2. Observed little heat, after using it for 45 minutes audio call\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Best Mobile for this price. Camera is par at the best. Both the front and rear cameras are excellent and the result is very detailed and very minute, previously was using Vivo V9 that to bought at Amazon. Low light photography is ok. Touch is excellent. Battery back up is also very good. Processing is very good without any lagging and no heating issues even at very very long usage, almost day long. Stylish and the curved edge screen is excellent\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I am using this for more than 6 months. Samsung has really upgraded the software glitches those used to create UI slowness.Pros:1. Camera is best2. Lightweight even after having 6000mAH battery3. Fingerprint sensor is very quick4. Display has wide color range and quite bright5. No software lag6. Best for multitasking7. Blue light filter is really helpful8. The motion stability is pretty useful. It is quite fascination to see that it never feels like the video has ever been shot with the phone holdin in the hands.9. The camera captures images with natural colors, not with punchy color like some other phones do.Cons:1. In Macro mode it is hard to focus on object, but it is rarely used2. Night mode could have been a bit better with grain reduction and with more brightness\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This phone has more than everything I expected. My favorite is this Super AMOLED screen just 😘.Pros-superb battery. 1- 1.5 dayCamera (Rear camera is on other level) + AR Emoji6 GB Ram (more than my laptop)Very nice call quality (I uses Airtel)Finger print sensor is fast.Selfie is better in natural lightingDedicated Memory card slot.Charging speed is not that slow.Feels very nice in hand and can be easily hold in one hand.Cons-Face unlock is slowww and few times didn't worked.Can't uninstall Netflix, Facebook and few other Samsung's app but these can be disabled.Got around 50 GB out of 64 GB.No back cover provided in box.Finger prints are all over the back.VerdictBest phone to buy around this budget. Super value for money. I am very happy to have this phone.Don't think just buy it. You won't regret.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I\\'ve had the phone for 22days now. The finger print reader is fast, no inconsistencies at all. It\\'s better than some indispaly print readers.I like the screen, initially wanted the Galaxy A71 for its 6.7\" screen, but once I had this delivered I realised a 6.4\" screen was more than I needed.The battery lasts for about 18hrs, after which I am left with about 24-28% charge (after heavy usage).Which light usage  I have gotten well over 24hrs on a single charge.One thing I can tell you though, is to slap a sturdy case on the phone immediately after purchase.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I love its simple design,one ui 2 and the sAmoled display,battery life is also good.But the camera quality is not that good as it has a 64 MP shooter... Its images are blurred and there's too much noise in it when using night mode...there's a lot of difference between normal vdo taking and with Steady mode on( vdo quality is not that good and there's noise)I bought this phone and after day 4..it started hanging while opening Amazon app..the menu hangs sometimes..so i replaced it..When opening.. the replaced phone has some software issues like the data disconnect randomly on its own for some time and while this happens i cant connect calls to anyone..first it doesn't ring..then even if the call is picked up on the other side..i didn't get to hear the voice..and when the hand up the call it still shows call on progress...and i have no network problem in my area..and all my other phones are working perfectly. I am very much irritated by this..so I'm returning the M31..\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  No guest mode, the only major drawback.Galaxy store downloads application without permission from user.You can hide applicaton but it would be hidden without security. With big battery, one has to deal with weight also.Camera is superawesome. It even captures the sunlight without making dark pictures. But there is no focus available in slefie mode. If image is captured through whatsapp camera, it will automatically crop the image everytime.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Phone is okay type, only plus point is the battery life which is really good.The piece is slightly heavy piece.The antutu benchmark details are enclosed.Finger print reader is real quick. But face scanner is too shabby as it takes time to unlock.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Hi All,Please don't buy this scrap from Samsung.I ordered it on the very first day of the launch and turned out to be a great mistake.The most important feature of any mobile  is making and receiving calls and this phone has problem with that only..All calls irrespective of dailed or received gets disconnected automatically within a minute.When I searched for this problem, found out that there are thousands of people who have the same problem.You can Google it yourself to see the harsh reality.Please don't but this.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 is the Perfect package out there. The Mega 6000mah battery easily gives me 2 days of battery backup. The 64mp camera gives amazing details in the photos. And the best part is, you can also take macro shots, not just with the macro lens, but with the help of 64MP camera too.I was looking for few of things from my new phone. I wanted a great camera, great battery backup, unique and elegant looking design on the back of the phone. Samsung Galaxy M31 provides all of it. Plus a Super-AMOLED display. Samsung is THE best display manufacturer out there. The exynos chipset is no less than any other chipset in the market.This phone has made me decide that my future phones will be of Samsung.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This phone is not as good as we expected. I bought it on 18 March 2020. So I am using it for more than 4 months. I was super excited while I saw the features like battery, camera, screen size all in my budget. But from past 1 month, I am facing an issue. Sometimes while I use the camera or watching a video and sometimes while I play the game into it, its screen gets completely black. If within 4 months I am facing this issue then I don't expect that it will work even for a year. Completely disappointed with Samsung. I won't go for Samsung in future.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Best device around 16k-17k. Overall 4.2/5.Build quality not good. I mean just nice. If i rate it then 3/5. Actually the back of the device is made with polycarbonate so If it were glass, it would be the best all-rounder device in this budget.Screen just superb. 4.7/5.Camera quality also nice. 4/5.Performance also good. I used Samsung J7 prime for 2 and half years. So i know what is the problem with exynos processor. So there exynos 9611 also good processor for approx 2 years. But then this is behave just a 7k-8k budget device. If there was a Snapdragon 712 or 720G processor, it would definitely be rocking device from SAMSUNG under 20k budget. Okay  but the current performance is really smooth and cool. So 4/5.Fingerprint scanner good but also have face unlock option so no problem for device lock security. Both work fine. 4/5.Battery gives approx a day with medium usage. 4/5But charging time really slow. 6000 mAh battery takes time to getting full charge around 2.5 hours. 3/5. Ok let's talk. I think i covered all the pros and cons. Then you decide that what should you do, buy or not buy. If you ask me then definitely go for it if you watch movie and video with decent gaming. I don't think of any other mobile for watching movies or videos. The screen just AWESOME. That's all.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is hands down the best smartphone available in the market at this price range. It performs great in almost every department.Cameras(both front and rear) are amazing. Clicks amazing detailed shots.Battery(6000 mah) is outrageous. Lasts for a day(heavy usage) or two(normal usage) easily.UI(one UI 2.0) is fantastic. Smooth and buttery experience.Display(Super Amoled FHD+)is gorgeous. Viewing angles are fantastic and color reproduction is amazing.Processor(Exynos 9611) is quite powerful. While it is not a gaming centered phone it performs above average in all high end games.Considering to but a smartphone with the best value for money? Then this is the best pick!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Very good mobile phone from Samsung.If you are looking for a mobile with bigger battery and also for good camera then I will recommend you this mobile. That is Samsung Galaxy M31. Excellent  mobile from SamsungIt is value for money mobile phone with great features at this price.I have purchased the 8 GB Ram and 128 GB storage variant at Rs 19,499.Samsung Galaxy M31 is really a very good mobile.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Hi,I would like to bring this to your notice that I had Purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) Sm-M315FZKGINS worth  Rs.15,999.00 on 5th of March 2020 from Amazon Prime Account which was Sold by STPL Exclusive Online and got was delivered on 7th March 2020.The Samsung M31 seems to be fake product, its not even a month the phone has stopped working completely. It keeps hanging frequently. While operating any application on phone, it stops responding along with this is issue the speaker quality has become very low (basically it does not functions) No Sound at all. Even while playing random videos on YouTube application as well in the phone's gallery it automatically gets fast forwarded without giving any command.Its altogether a very disappointing experience not only with the Samsung Phone Brand but also with Amazon Prime Membership Account and the online Retailer (STPL Exclusive Online) listed on Amazon.I would request to please get the Product replaced Asap, as Due to lock-down I am unable to even take it to Samsung Service Center or to any Mobile Repairing Shop.Note: Kindly Respond to the above complaint, or legal action will be taken further at your Cost.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  After using an iphone this phone feels quite low in performance. The screen resolution is not sharp, the camera has filters but images are not sharp. A bit slow response to certain apps.Otherwise good with fingerprint response, battery life is amazing overall for the price it's good for general use.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Worth the penny.Smooth UI. Good battery. Brilliant screen. Beautiful to look at and to hold in hand.But still few words to say.6000 ma battery should last two days unless UI consume huge power. The battery is excess for one day but not monstrous as described.Fast charger is enough fast only it to charge it three long hours.The camera quality is good in day light but could not understand why is it told 48 mega pixel. It's a gimmick. A good 13 mp is equivalent to the said 48 mega pixel. The camera fails to impress in low light photography just like other mobile phone camera.As a whole it's a good buy in the price tag of around Rs.13000.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  You've already got the reviews but here I am reviewing as a gamer only about a few things.# Battery is OK if you use only for calling or internet surfing but drains rapidly as you play games for few hours.# Heating issue on the upper part (back + front side) of the phone especially when you play games.# Its charging cable is too short even not completely 1 meter.# It says fast charging but it doesn't look like there's such system it has. Because it took more 2 hours to complete charging.# It's auto brightness feature not working properly.# With Pubg type games, I'm having a slightly display resolution problem on its edge but only with selective games app.PROS you know very well so, I'm not gonna mention. Rest qualities or features are same as company mentioned.BUT do something with this HEATING issue even happens during charging whether you use it or not.##Overall not bad for gaming.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Camera: This a quad camera phone image quality is very good, video stability is good compare to other 15k phone, It produce natural colour and i like AR Emoji option.Front camera 32MP performing good and give good output.Built: Nice built,it's plastic built but looking good.Display: 6.4inch Display quality is very very good, i can't see this type of good display till now. Amoled display perform very good.Gaming : Gaming performance was too good. And no heating issue.No lagging in PUBG.Software and one UI : Good experiance compare to stock UI. and more hidden features are their. Call record,spam call,vpn,Dolby Atmos,Blue light filter etc..Ultra data saving perform good job. And provide good security.Fingerprint Reader: It's working very fast.Battery life : Give better battery life. It give more than 7hr screen on time.Charging : 15w charger performing good. 25 to 100% in 2hr 30min.Handling : Less weight,easy to hold.Call quality : call quality is good.Speaker : Speaker preforming good job, Dolby Atmos improves sound quality at the time of using our ear phone.Processing: Exynos 9611 performing good.This phone having more  features. I like it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The Samsung M31 is a power packed performer not only among it's equivalent price range smartphones but comparative to all high end phones available in the market today.1. Overall Handling is quite satisfying. With an Amoled Screen and a good resolution perfect for binge watching. You can switch between Vivid and Natural colours though (don't know why it comes in vivid default).2. Has a 64 MP rear camera with ultra wide and depth however as anyone would have a nick for wanting the best, there still is room for improvement.3. Comes with Face recognition and Finger print scanner, however there is a fraction of a second's lag while unlocking the phone. Recognition does get better with more use.4. Has an inbuilt Optimiser in the UI with anti-theft features to clear up memory,check battery usage and scan through an inbuilt antivirus. So that is an addition, however a third party antivirus should still be used as back up.5. The smartphone boasts of a 6000mAH mega battery and it lives up to the figure with 9-10 hrs of battery if used continuously and upto 2 days with normal to minimal use(Frankly speaking I gifted the phone to my mother and was surprised to see it working at 28%, the day after it was charged..also it was charged in the evening around 5 pm...so still not 2 days). The Charger supports fast charging but I wouldn't compare it to One Plus' dash charging as it would take upto 150 mins to reach full charge on M31.Eventually I did want to buy one more for myself,but there already is one M31 in the family.A great buy.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The above stars are only for battery, AI features and camera.CONS :1) SLIGHT HEATING ISSUE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND AS WELL IN THE BACK2) WIDE ANGLE CAMERA IS NOT CLEAN IF YOU TRY TO ZOOM IN AT ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT4) POSITION OF SPEAKER IS POOR AS IT GETS BLOCKED WITH FINGERS WHILE PLAYING GAMES OR TEXTING . THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DUAL SPEAKER.3) NO HEADPHONE AND COVER INSIDE THE BOX4)GIVEN 6000MAH BATTERY , IT WILL LAST ONLY 1/2 HALF DAYS , WHICH IS OK COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES5) 15W CHARGER TAKES 2:30 hrs TO COMPLETE 100%, WHERE AS IF YOU CHARGE THEM THROUGH Mi POWER BANK WITH 18W SPEED IT COMPLETES BIT QUICKER.6) BIT SLIPPERY IN CORNERS COZ OF WHICH FINDING DIFFICULT TO PLAY GAMES. HOWEVER CASE CAN ELIMINATE THIS ISSUE7) POOR NIGHT VISION CAMERA.8) FINGER PRINT UNLOCKER  AS USUAL POOR IN SAMSUNGPROS:- FRONT AND BACK CAMERA ARE AWESOME UNDER LIGHTING.- LASTS 1 AND HALF DAYS OF BATTERY IN EXTREME USE.-GAMING AND SOME AI FEATURES ARE GOOD.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The phone works great.Display:Most amazing display anyone can ever get in this price range. This phone's display is better than any phone in this proce range. Movie watching experience is truly amazing on this phone.Camera:All 4 cameras have different purpose and works fine. Camera quality is great and zoomed photos are very clear too. The display of the phone helps the camera to display it's clicked photos even better. Although i found a big issue that camera isn't able to focus at small objects placed near to it. It maybe a software problem which i am hoping would be resplved with the next update.Interface:The new Samsung interface is better than its previous ones. This is way more friendly and easier to use.GPU:A very strong processor is provided by Samsung in this phone. None of the games lag and works perfectly fine.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I give this Review after 15 days of purchase.I got this phone on Rs. 15999/- Thanks to SBI Credit card offer gave me 1500Rs discounts.Thanks to Amazon for very fast service when purchase this phone Delivery timing is 15 days but I got this phone in 5 days. Truly Amazing Amazon. When I was Purchasing this phone  I have not interested in camera features because I purchase this phone for professional use and ruff and stuff use. But I am surprise when I seen the camera clearity and features that was beyond my expectations.The best battery life I ever use. I am continuing watch study or entertainment Video in high brightness. No need to carry the charger with me in office.This is my second Samsung Phone I am giving Reviews from my My old phone Samsung galaxy J7Prime. I use this phone from last 4 year and this is also working properly. I purchase new phone just because of Internal storage full issue.We love the Samsung product and Amazing Amazon service.Highly Recommended Samsung M31.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Worst battery life, It takes 5 hours to charge 100%, Battery Drains in 12 hours only for normal usage, Decreasing Customer Faith, There is nothing  correct details regarding  battery as it shows in the phones features, Amazon Also Takes Too much  Time For Inpection And Its Technician Are Also Fraud, It is So Hard To Replace might be impossible And there is no return or refund policy, So it's better not to Buy It on Amazon and save your money.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  6k battery is its usp.Not at all bulky considering it has a 6k batteryIt comes with latest android version 10 n Samsungs 1UI 2.0.Smooth performance. 128 gm memory is enough for an above average user same with 6gb ram.Nice camera with great options. Same with selfie camera. Pics in low light/night could be better but guess its a software thing that samsung would fix in the future updates.Would have loved a metal body and on screen fingerprint sensor but yes can't expect everything at this price. Fullyloaded mobile at this price and best thing is its made in India.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I got M31 on 6th March and with  in a month time there was a software update on April 10th. I accepted the software too  my goodness the mobile got hanged and its in downloading status from morning 11 am on wards........... Its like dum next to me .Reason is there is a software issues in the mobile and also the mobile is getting hanged often.Its not worth to buy in Samsung  no value for money and it a stress for us.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This is my first Samsung phone after a very long gap. It has got simple and minimal design that looks good. Speed is good and phone works smoothly.However, within days of purchase I am finding that UI is functioning erratically sometimes. Certain apps may not start and phone is getting hanged. Sometimes it goes to some kind of sleep mode and after that it takes ages to be revived, sometimes even have to restart.Sorry Samsung. I am disappointed.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Pro:Phone Display is impressive 5 out of 5, Battery life impressive 5/5, Phone weight management excellent 5/5, Speaker output is Normal.Cons: Front camera detailing need to improvement rating 3/5, Back Camera detailing need to improvement rating 3/5, I'm Facing Performance issue phone hang issue without any gaming (I'm just a normal user i'm not a gamer or heavy user ) during YouTube surfing , There is no option for apps lock for privacy related, Phone build quality need to improve volume up down & power button very poor quality its to hard.Suggestion: Samsung can fix most of the things with help of software update, specially camera detailing issue.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Product is very good. This mobile phone has best battery backup. Anyone can think 6000 mah battery with 64 mp rear back camera and 32 mp front camera. The fingerprint is responding so fast. Fack lock is outstanding. Security level is very good. This mobile phone has mamy more features like- screenshot with hand. Screen display is very smooth with gorilla glass. The Samsung prosser of this phone is best for gaming. The ram is very good and rom also. This phone also produces just small amount of radiation compare to other phone. I think this mobile can beat I phone also and at last I recommend this phone to that who want  mobile phone working for 2 or 3 year. I really....... Like this phone Samsung. Your company is best for me.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This product is very smoothly working for me. Very smooth to touch and hold. The display is very sharp. Finger print reader read very efficiently. Camera, both front and rear, wide and normal range are of superb quality. Telephoto or zooming needs improvement though. Battery capacity is same like a 4000mAh phone I had earlier, I am satisfied with the battery, but may have last little longer as it is 6000mAh.Finally, the phone is sturdy enough to sustain from major injury, even after accidental fall from 3rd floor.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Not happy with camara back and Front, even front camera is perform like VGA camera.Also full plastic body seems Samsung made this PRODUCT by mistake and we buy to consider Samsung brand !Compare to this other all phone are best in quality and money saver too with aluminum body!Feeling like we fool that use this phone and can\\'t return coz loackdown immediately after buy \"covid 19\"This phone is a big black spot on Samsung brand image, I strongly recommend not to buy this.Night mode also not working face unlock is also frustrating and not working most of time.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This review is for the new exchange system, which is ABSOLUTELY USELESS. The app should be logged in on the phone to be exchanged. And then after the whole procedure of exchange one should go and reset the factory settings. A lot of time is wasted and the process is so very confusing. Plus I had already reset to the factory settings so I had to download your app again and then log in and then go through the entire dumb procedure.  I want to contact you using your contact us field, but there I have to go through a series of questions and I am not even able to type my query, so I am forced to put out my review here.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Samsung M31 is wow for its battery. Fingureprint reader is very nice it recognized very quickly, someime I found it's  unresponsive (3times in a 2 month) so used face recognition  or have to use PIN. Camera I like to use 64mp main camera at 3:4. It is amazing in revealing details of close up picture (you can see clearly and  detail of these tiny roof moss/algae, 3.5mm headphone jack was used for size comparison. When I use for scenery photos are good too. Only problem I found is sharpness of photo at highest zoom ( zooming photo to its highest) I think sharpness is good but not best. Samsung should improve processing of photo for excellent shrpness otherwise what  is benefit of giving better lens. I usually use  Adobe lightroom. Last 2 pics were processed in lightroom.  All other camera are  good too. Video quality is very good. All I'm very satisfied for having Samsung M31 phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am writing this review after using this phone for 4day.This is a best budget phone in the range of 15000 as whatever u want  all the things are inside this phone, if u compare this phone  With One plus 7T  Then in camera and battery backup  this phone get a Superb value. I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.I want to explain it's some feature as below1stly Battery 5star2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.3rd Front camera - 4star.4th Processor - 4star5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4starThese all ratings are out of 5.Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Fingerprints,  Battery  life and Also Cameras quality is best I give +5 Rating. Thanks Amazon  and also Specialy thanks to STPL Exclusive Online Sellers  company.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I bought this phone for my husband and he couldnt have been more happy.I will write about the things he liked best.1. He says his laptop has a Ram of 8GB and this phone has 6GB of Ram and because of this huge Ram, the phone runs like makkhan ( Indian Butter).2. The camera quality is like awesome. He never used to click these many pictures before. It has special food button which is specialized to click pictures of food items. The night camera can make night look like day, ITS THAT GOOD.3. AR EMOTICON : Now this is something I like more. It can turn you into emoticons which is like very cool.4. Battery life : After the first day when he charged the phone to 100%, he only plugged the phone into the charger after like 2 days. The c-port charger is also like an add on.I find it a worthy investment :D\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The battery life is something which makes one remember the famous old advertisement which said \"Kya Karu Petrol Khatam hi nahi Hota\". It lasts long really long.Phone is super smooth with no lags. The display is very bright and the sound quality is awesome too.The camera is one of the best in the class and probably much better than anything available in this range. Please note that you have to change a few things in the settings to be able to use the camera in a better way. The default camera mode is controlled to conserve memory.The only annoying thing is that few apps are automatically installed with software updates.And, then you have to take the extra effort to locate it and remove it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  sAMOLED screen is the biggest plus point.Battery is huge but the charger is bit slow, 18 watt charger takes a lot of time to get it charged. 30 watt charger would have done the job.Speakers are loud but only primary speaker works not good for dolby atmos experience.Camera is good not the best.face recognition is just pathetic.finger print reader is not that fast.processor is average not as powerful as latest snapdragon processors.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The phone is really smooth in operating, it's amoled display does give you a feel of holding a premium phone in hand, it has 6000mAH battery, the phone is really handy, plastic body, but still very grippy, it is light and fits in your hands perfectly, and not like other phones like redmi 8 pro and so on which are much heavy and oversized, it is packed with exynos 9611 I was skeptic about this processor since I was into Snapdragon before, but yeah, the exynos does the work, and the main thing, for most of them buyers, playing games, tried PUBG on this phones, there are very little very very little frame drops, phone heats up sometimes, so I always play by taking off the cover, battery does a great job while playing PUBG, speaking about the camera, trust me, it is a camera of flagship level, I mean the clarity is so great for daytime conditions, haven't tried clicking anything at low light, since I didn't need one, main stuff, it also has 3.5 mm Jack and Dolby atmos support, so you can expect some great earphones experience, and I guess that covers it all.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Got the handset M31_128GB on Thursday (21/05/20).

The huge battery has been a big relief for me and from the battery drain tension when going on a long trip. I don't use it for gaming so typically I have to charge twice in three days. You may need to keep for a long time for it to charge fully.  The screen display is sharp and clear.The build is good. It fell a couple of times from bed but the curved edges on the sides have prevented it from getting scratches. I don't like putting case or screen protector as it increases the weight and reduces the aesthetics. Also, don't put keys in the same pocket as it can give permanent marks on the glass. The black backside is a finger magnet and it will take some time for you to get used to it.I have given five stars also because of customer care which takes your error reports seriously.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Wonderfup option for water heater,Most pathetic phone I have ever seen. Heats up unbelievably highCamera is awesome but no use after 20 mins camera will stop due to excessive heat.Battery life is fake don't believe nowhere compares to claims made.

What you need to know is it's UI is great but on the cost of processor and finger print. It's been almost 2 months and it has started to hang and sometimes to the extent where I have to restart the phone. And talking about finger print scanner it's worthless man because it most of the time doesn't detect it (if you have sweating finger even a bit of it) or delayed detection. Apart from that it's a great phone but these 2 cons are a major one so won't recommend it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Never buy phones from Amazon. They have sent me defective phone. It is switches off several times,  this phone is not even receiving network properly. Internet speef is like 2g and people on the other end always complain about my voice getting cut and low voice during the call. I was assuming that due to lockdown Network is weak. But its been two months I have been facing same problem and have realized the phone is defective. Amazon is not ready to replace the phone. This is my first and last phone from Amazon.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Pros.1. Super display to watch movies, YouTube and web series.2. Excellent battery backup, min 2 days at moderate usage3.

Video quality also good and auto focus is also very fast6. Fast processor handles multitasking smoothly7. Gaming and graphics are manage very well, very smooth experience8. Touch sensitivity is nice Cons1. Build quality should have been better than this as no frame is used and cheap plastic is used at the back.2. Gorilla glass 5 should have been given instead of gorilla 3.3. Charging time is almost 2 to 3 hours from 0 to 100%4. Brightness lacks in sunlight5. Dual speakers should have been given instead of mono speakerOverall must buy product compared to other brands in market at this price point.All features are upto the mark as mentioned in the featues nothing lacks behind.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Review after one month of usage:8gb RAM is not really working like 8gb...its slightly better than previous Redmi Note 4-4gb RAM.Battery is good. Lasts more than a day with moderate usage with more than 100 apps installed.Camera is very good.Night photos need to be better.Function & additional feature wise, its too good.Feature of working in pop-up window is very good.Sometimes, bit slow in responding.Overall, its just a good phone in below 20k budget.After 45 days of usage, CHANGING TO 3 STARS !!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  software update is bad it got freezed or hanged totally while updating software at time of lock down now getting replaced or returned is not possible and even service centers are closed even customer care support are unable to solve it so i had to buy new mobile.... i suggest pls do not go for this mobile this is waste product performance is very bad very slow gets hanged lot with moderate usage battery is also just one and half day, camera clarity is not up-to mark, had lot of belief in Samsung products till now i was using Samsung products now because of this bad product i strongly suggest not to go for this, it has got Samsung exynos processor the performance is not good....pls i suggest dont go for htis product.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I Bought this phone on June 14 th after opening the box I got disappointed. The first pic I took in the front camera is the worst camera pic I have ever seen .There is no pixel or clarity it looks like 1 MP camera. After that I took a pic from back camera the picture looks as if it is taken from some basic phone .I got this phone for 18 k within 5 hours I sold it to my frnd for 14 K who recommended this phone for me. Already I'm using asus mobile for 9 K the camera is much much better than M31.Secondly I went into the youtube and opened a 4K video and went into the setting to change the resolution to 1080 pixel video but it was an sock to me the maximum resolution value is 480 pixel only.You can play the video in 480 pxl only.Tats y they did not release the mobile in the showroom.

There are many better ones in the market.Its the 3rd day of using, already the phone hangs and stucks.Dont get cheated by the ratings on amazon, there are many ways they can increase it.

Brilliant  performance, brilliant battery life, amazing camera, brilliant overall.1. The screen.sAMOLED display  is on point, super clear & very well user friendly.2. The camera.Stunning. 64mp does the job the way it's supposed to. Front 32mp camrea is also very impressive. In the rear, quad camera setup is impressive. The sample images are a few example of the camera quality. Also the wide angle lens is a rather wonderful function.3. The battery.Probably the biggest highlight of this smartphone is the battery. A MASSIVE 6000mAh battery can easily go on throughout the day with enough battery life left for the next day. For an average user, the battery will easily live upto 2 days. Heavy usage? It will still go on for a day. Even when the battery is about 15 to 20% the performance doesnt show any decline. The only thing i found a bit not so good about the phone is the charger. M31 comes with a 15W charger which will take atleastaround 2.3 hrs to charge fully. But the new M31s fixes the problem, it comes with a 25W charger & the same 6000mAh battery promising shorter charging time.4. Built quality & design.Front and rear looks impressive. Has a very modern yet conservative designs. Doesn't feel that heavy while holding and is also a perfect fit in the pocket.The blue colour looks beautiful but the one i have is a black one. Yes, the black looks cooler but since the rear is made up of plastic with a glossy finish, it can very easily attaract scratches and fingerprints,  so I'd suggestanyone to use it with a mobile cover.5. Verdict.Overall the smartphone is an impressive package. It simply proves that spending over 50k on a smartphone is insane. Some complain about the processor that is Exynos 9611 which is in my point of view nothing to be worried about. Every function runs smooth and easy thanks to the processor and 6gb RAM, touchscreen is also very responsive,  also the power button can be used to open apps as a shortcut. With 128gb space, dual sim support, 6gb ram, a great battery life, sAmoled display, this phone has everything that it takes to be a flagship phone competitor as a considerable margin. Its almost been more than 2 months since im using this phone and so far i haven't faced any problems with the device any hopefully will not face any in the coming future. The surprising thing is that with all the power packed in the box, it still manages to fit under 20k category which makes it incredibly appealing. I'd surely suggest if anyone is looking to buy one!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  My previous two phones were Redmi note 3 and Redmi note 5 pro mainly because of the specs it offered and was th best option available that time. Well my heart wanted to again buy a Redmi phone again but mind did not allow that maybe anti China sentiments(not naive) and thought of using something different. Lets test try the change.They increased the price of the phone by 1000 rs during lockdown and it did hurt me but I still went ahead with the phone. I am using 8GB 128GB model. (Rs19500). It cost me 2k to 3k compared to other phones but dimag tha jo mann nai raha tha.Amazing battery. It definitely last a days use and I mean it even when you use it extensively apart from gaming. Surfing, videos, movies , you can do alot of other thing it will last 20 -28 hours and battery wont disappoint you.Security: i felt more secured using a Samsung phone than the redmi phones that i have used earlier. This is something personally what i have felt.Camera: Camera quality is good and i did not get lags while clicking pictures. Honestly I do not click much pictures so this does not really matter to me.Display and Touch: Display is fine but screen gets streched, related to resolution mainly so you may not be a able to see the score of football matched on the left corner, or youtube subtitles in the full screen mode. Touch could haven better i felt and more quick.Performance: I did find issues here and i am really disappointed with the performance even though i compensated with higher ram i do feel lag while opening apps switching between apps, handling multiple task and lag here and there. I am bit skeptic not sure how much the performance degradation will happen down the line. The performance is not seamless and not upto the mark. could have been better.Ui: i am not enjoying the samsung ui and it is complicated and it does not have basic features of spamming callers or catergorzing or app lock and takes time to search through the settings option(major lag there). The navigation is difficult. I really enjoyed miui.Sound Quality: Decent not amazing not bad..okaish it wont thrill you. Could have been better.Gaming: I am not using this phone for gaming and not sure how it work but i think it wouldnt be a great performer with high end graphic games.For me Battery and Performance, ui should be top notch.  that is my only requirement. 5 for battery, 3 for performance and 2.5 for ui.There are far better phones available then again non-chinese this is the only best option.This is will get done all you day to day activity.Maybe an I buy an iPhone next time would make me an I-diot? Lol.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Samsung galaxy m31 is great. I like its battery.Display is also cool. No lag when you are opening many applications same time. I have used it for many days now. Takes 2 hour to full the battery from zero which is less. Fast 15 w charger. If you are going for 6gb ram 128 gb I would prefer go for it. Talking camera i was amazed to see wide photos with high clarity. Selfie too has added advantages. Thanks samsung for making a high end mobile at this affordable price. Also samsung is made in india. So people go for local.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The best part of Galaxy M31 is its battery life which out class its competitors.  It's sleek and sophisticated looks simply mesmerizes. Talking about its features fingerprint reader,  wide angle camera, with extendable memory features makes it more convenient to use.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Hang mobile 3,4,second,heating  major problem's,fingerprint reader properly  not work one times then miss match,camera qulity blurs,battery draining issue\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It's nice phone. This is Best Option for Replacement of China Product.But didn't impress me. while using camera sum-time it's fail and its throw me back to home screen. specially when using slow motion feature. i am not so much impress with camera result. specially if you are a professional photographer. if i compare with other brand then i am not so much impress with camera result.sum-time my brand new phone little lag in sum app.and there is lots off feature i like very useful Like Dark Mode, Focus Mode, Inbuilt Dolby Atmos is Amazing.There is one good option in camera is Scene optimizer is also a good feature.and also say value for money.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The overall Phone design and handling is okay but lacks quality both in the the material used and the software performance. I've been using this phone for over 2 months now and all I can say is that I shouldn't have taken the negative reviews lightly. The phone lags even with minimal activity. The fingerprint sensor is almost insensitive and reminds me of old samsung phone touch screens. The camera quality is amazing but only after you adjust the settings to different(highest) resolution. Battery life is subpar and way lower than what I thought a battery this size would perform but the fast charger takes care of that problem to some extent . The inbuilt operating system lacks any applock which has to be installed from play store. The phone is okay for someone who doesn't use or expect much from his/her phone except basic functionality but I'd recommend going for a different phone if you're a heavy user or for gaming.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Cons:Heats up a lot :The phone heats up a lot along the upper body during charging and gradually the entire display gets heated up . you wont be able to make calls on the phone just after unplugging  due to excessive heat.RAM usage :Phone after factory reset with no apps running consumes whooping 3GB RAM .  So the 6GB RAM is a MYTH. You hardly get 2GB of RAM space  for your applications .Memory : Out of the 64GB of memory , the system UI and OS takes a whopping 12GB of memory space .Pros:Camera is decent  and Fingerpint access is quite smooth.Summary: Phone heating up is a huge disappointment. Not sure if the product is user safety compliant\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  fingerprint, camera and battery were all fine but the screen has some serious issue. Not even one day passed since i started using this phone that it started showing problems with the touch. The touch was not at all responsive and after some time whenever i was unlocking it, accidental touch protection automatically gets activatedand i am unable to remove it and basically i am unable to use this phone. I immediately requested for return but the problem is i cannot do anything with the phone so i can not even reset it and i have already logged into my various accounts in this phone.

I bought this at 14999. At that price I needed 4 things:a) Good processing power and RAMb) Sufficient internal memory & expansionc) Good batteryd) Good cameraI'm very happy with the first 2. I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography. The sensor is what matters and it is good enough for this price point.Some of the built-in features are good.In short, I'm happy with my purchase.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I also have m 30 but 31 is betterJust love this handsetBattery life- lasts extremely longer than any mobile phone even when used with pubgSound- loud and clearDisplay - greatLove the colour vry sleak and sexyCamera quality is superb... Till now it has been almost 7 months the phone is working perfectly fineAffordableFinger print reader - had no issues with that too\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I bought this phone about a month back and it has a super annoying thing. The phone auto restarts whenever it thinks to do so. Its not a hardware issue as such, its by design. Try googling this issue for M31 and many other users are frustrated. Best part is there is no solution to it. Next problem is its too slow, it doesnt matter if it has 8 GB ram and 4.5 GB shows as free, if you just try to scroll a whatsapp chat window, or simply type a text message, first word starts to appear on the screen after you have typed entire sentence. A usual \"suggestion\" given by ppl is free up RAM and storage or disable  \"auto-restart\" in device care (which is not even enabled). My phone is almost new and i dont play games or do heavy multi tasking. Ram is never 50% utilized and storage is hardly 30 GB used out of 128 GB and yet you cannot even type a text message nicely.On the positive side, camera and battery are as expected. However, trust me, you\\'ll get frustrated by its lag and restart feature.Verdict :- Its a trash.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  almost 1month comleat with this m31 phone. And its really good product.

All things are good  but it is taking more than 4hrs for charging. I don't know whether it's a defective one or is the  characteristic of Samsung m31.

It's charging within 3hrs, though it's not fast charging but ok for me. The day 1 sluggish charging may be due to first time charging of the phone in use. Now it is performing well. If you want a phone with good battery back up and best screen quality then you can go for it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Battery: If one uses it like just a phone, you can get upto 4 days of battery. However, I get 3 days of battery because of my bluetooth usage.5/5.Screen: I haven't seen such bright and colour accurate screen ever! People who require a lot of videos and movies, just go for it.5/5.Face detect: Not so good. 3/5.Fingerprint scanner: I would say it gets the job done however, a little more speed and accuracy would have been better. 4/5.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Hi all samsung fans,Galaxy M31 is wonderful phone overall. The main pros of this phone is camera and display. I  should say about the one UI also, its a wonderful work by Samsung. Lots of customization is available in One UI. Quad cam is awesome. For pubg I can play in high refresh rate and UHD graphics.Their are few drawbacks too...6000 Mah battery doesn't show the perfomance as it says, but its decent...Phone has a slight heat issue, only on heavy usage.Overall Samsung Galaxy M31 is a supercool phone that you can have in this price rage.Note to samsung:1. Please add secure folder in next update.2. Provide a built in app lock.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Messages can be categorized. Charging status  can be monitored in off screen mode also which is illuminated in a small icon while charging. Charge last for 36 hours for a moderate user like me. The home screen may be turned automatically into monochrome mode during our desired night hours . For each app timer can be set which may prevent us to limit our exposure to mobile phone. Memory can be optimised with smart optimised with a touch of a button. When compared to my previous L G k10 which I purchased for this same price 3 years ago, it is far better . Camera quality  is outstanding. Since the Mobile is loaded  with 6GB Ram which promotes the response speed. 128 GB internal memory is a plus point. No lagging  and heating  problem sofar since my usage from 7.9.2020. Amazon shoppers have done a great job. Mobile has arrived safely. Overall this Mobile is worth the money we are paying for\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Writing a review after using it for 3 heavy usage days ( Hope My detailed review Helps )1. Display ( 4.5/5 ) - Amoled displays are always good that normal LCD Display , This phone's Display is perfect , good punchy colours ..Video watching is a pleasure2. Volume (4/5) - Good volume , speakers are good. Audio is loud .... Should have been better3 . Performance ( 4 / 5 ) - Good speed in a budget smartphone .... Exynos 9611 processor is decent ....( no lag )4 . Camera : ( 4.5 /5 ) - Camera is absolutely great , taking some sharp pics , and selfie camera is also good ..... ( some pics will be attached soon )5 . Battery : ( 5/5 ) - Main part of this phone ... Its really Monster Battery ....about 2 days of normal and heavy usage ( I m a heavy user )I m getting 10 hr screen time ......which is awesomeHope my detailed review helps\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The battery is the best part of the mobile. It really lasts long. You can easily play PUBG for an hour and the battery will be reduced to maximum 15 percent. The touch response and display is fantastic !! The s-amoled  display is really vibrant. The display feels really premium and better than high end premium phone. I have honor 10 which is 35K, compared to which this display and performance is better . I prefer using this more than my Honor 10.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  .I have been using this Samsung Galaxy M31 for 3 months now.Here is what I like about this phone-I am quite satisfied with it's 48 MP Triple Camera that delivers quite beautiful picture quality, Other than that I am happy with the long lasting battery, fast charging, smooth touch response and the clarity of super amoled display. Other good thing about the phone is that it does not heat up even after a long time of game play both online and offline.But ...I am not satisfied with the functioning problem of the phone that quite an often the phone hangs when I am typing something and some other times it get re-started on its own.& apart from its functioning it does not come with free customisation of themes and icons as everything is paid.Overall Phone is good.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've ordered Samsung M31 for my cousin sister who is staying away from metro cities and the delivery was within 2 days. The earpiece of the phone overheating while normal voice calls. Her sister in law has recently purchased samsung M01 which has no heating issues. I tried to place a replacement order but it has connected her with the technical support team and they asked to install diagnosis app. After checking from their side they told that the temperature up to 45 degree Celsius is normal. But literally she is feeling the heat in the ear while making calls. But the technical team is defending their product quality. I'm really upset..I have tried more than 10 times..Dear Amazon team... Please look at my buying history.. I'm a genuine buyer.. Please replace the handset\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Have been using it for more than 2 months now and this phone is pretty much living up to whatever was mentioned in the specs. I don't play mobile games so I won't be able to comment on its gaming performance but it's perfect for everyday usage.Battery 10/10.Camera 9/10.It does have some heating issues but I guess it's the same with every budget smartphone out there.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Very nice phone at this price range from Samsung. Really amazing...Just some minor issues: it doesn't have Knox security, its plastic back can easily invite scratches, Samsung could have improved the charging quality and its processor too and it doesn't have a screen recording feature or link to windows feature. The 32mp front camera is not good as good as expected it gives you the quality of a 15 to 20mp camera.It really has a super battery life, very nice rear quad camera with plenty of new features, amazing display, the fingerprint sensor and the face unlock is superfast and it gives you a nice performance.Hope you find this helpful.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  What I am impressed is the camera quality in night time. The  battery life is long enough to keep you occupied for the  whole day. Now the charging speed is not best in class but its fast. I loved upgrading from my old phone. Moreover Amazon allowed me to exchange my old phone that brought the price of the phone in my budget. Thanks.Many customizable features for dark mode, blue light, game recording etc are best.On the downside. You will feel lack of snapdragon processor during heavy gaming. Otherwise I would have given 5 star.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  What I Like on M31(30days Review)Value for Money ProductSamsung One UI 2.0 (best UI among all UI's)6.4 inch, 403 PPI, Super AMOLED display (Best for Always on display, Best for Black, also helps saving battery as black pixels are not lit).Battery 6000 mAh(Amazing Battery Backup, Lasts almost 1.5 days for even an heavy user like me).Camera 64 MP Back/32 MP Front (I have attached sample photos).No heating issues at all in 30 days usage.What I don't Like isNot able to upgrade to 2.1 One UIExynos dosen't support GcamFast changing with15W is very slow takes approx 2 hours to get fully charged.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  After 3days of usage my view points;I'm not a gamer my previous phone was Realme1 for me this is definitely a worthy upgrade .Phone UI looks more better and standard compared to Color os  And looks stunning .For me battery last approximately 2days , but not justified 6000mah expected much better performance , but got a very good battery life.Camera department neither good or bad,  it didn't justified its 64mp camera , over saturated images , and video poor performance in low light condition. In night camera seems horrible.In Audio department M31 inferior to Realme 1 , m31 lack its sound quality and also bluetooth codec Ldac .But decent audio output guaranteed.Pros;BatteryDisplayWidevine L1FingerprintDolbyCamera (in good lighting)One UI (No so much junks, Very clean compared to Realme UI&MI UI)Cons;Low light photography horribleVideo shootNo caseBattery optimizationLack of LdacSecurity patch### Rised Replacement request  , phone switchoff frequently  ,\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Device is overall good, But I must say that camera quality is not upto the level I was expecting it being a 64MP camera phone.Front camera photography is a not good in dark and images appear very grainy. Talking about image processing Colors are oversaturated and during video calls you could see a yellow tint. This underperformance of the front camera is because of the notch design as there is less space in the front for another camera/ flash.The rear camera is somewhat good in photography and and the videography is pretty good.BloatwaresWith this phone Samsung has targeted the  budget phone section as they were falling behind the likes of other Chinese manufacturers. Though they have packed this phone with massive features but it comes with  a trade off i.e. Bloatwares and sponsored app downloads. If you are wise enough to bypass those app promotions you can happily use this phone.Overall, I am satisfied with the phone because I didn't want to go for Chinese companies. But still I miss Good front camera.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Yes,its the best of its kind its been 3days since its arrival and i loved it,. Has many good features and display clarity is amazing..but i dont get the feel of 8GB even  though..customercare is awesome they r there for u evrytime so if u hav any suggestions or queries  abt the product u can right away ask with the help of samsung member  app in it.finger print reader is good,cam is also good,battery depends on how u use it..on standby mode with data on ,it can last around 2days max,and it has a premium  look,evn though its made frm plastic case...\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  \\xa0Worst product.Camera performance is below average.I received a defective product and when asked for replacement, they performed a smartcheck and said everything is fine.Whenever I make a video call the other person is not able to hear properly.I have checked by putting the same sim card on a different mobile and used the same app to video call(WhatsApp) which was fine. When I complained on the video quality, I was told to use super steady mode.I have attached a video  shooted in super steady in the same mobile which was like the old video cassette we use to watch during 90s.Do check that before you invest your money in this smartphone.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I buyed phone on sale day 2 and received next day that , what I liked about the phone is battery Backup and Camera features rest things are pretty common like other competitors phone. Software is much better and impressive display in this segment.Cons:Volume is very low on callFace recognition  could be improvedLags and gets little heat up while heavy gamimg.Fast charging is not fast may be because of bigger battery 6000mah\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Pros and Cons compare to other mobiles in the same budgetPros.1. Awesome Display2. Battery Excellent3. Build quality is OK4. Camera (both front and back) is good ( not comparing with flagship mobile cams )5. Speaker sound quality is decent6. One UI is OK but it could have been better7. Processor is good and with 6GB RAM it's performance is smoothCons.1. No back cover out of the box.2. 15w charger is enough for 6000mah battery3. Camera (both front and back) in low light is not up to the mark4. There are few issue with software for example, sometimes unable to send SMS, Samsung customer took remote access but unable to find reason.hope these software issues will be fixed soon with future updatesOver all - it is a value for money.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Being an iPhone user for 4 years, I was skeptical about switching to Android. Yet, the Samsung M31 got my attention right at the moment I saw it on Amazon.And it has surpassed all my expectations and more. I've never been this satisfied with a phone's performance at this price range.It is absolutely amazing in all aspects from camera to battery. Performance is smooth. I'm not a gamer but occasional PUBG was a lag free experience.Overall, this is the best you can get for 17K right now.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  M31 is equipped with all the features what one wish to have in mobile. After reviewing all makes and comparison, I choose to have M31 and I must say, my decision was not wrong. Amazon delivered the product before their committed date. 6gb Ram, 128gb Storage, Octa core, 64MP quad Camera is more than enough. Functional Performance is very good. 6000mah Battery performance is too good. No need to charge even for next day. Camera also delivers good picture quality throughout day and night. Sensors like Biometric & Compass are very useful. I am truly enjoying M31. Samsung has indeed done a great job by launching M series compared to other make mobiles at very competitive price.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Camera domain is not a great piece here. My other device Asus 5Z performs well with 8mp than this 64mp shooter. Samsung should develop this camera's performance asap.Battery is fantastic. Gets thru 2 days easily.UI & moderate multitasking is smooth.Hardware is well built and feels sturdy.But still, added protection of screen guard and case is must.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Remember:* Galaxy M series phones don't have Knox security, so you won't get features like Secure folder, Samsung Pass, Samsung Pay, and other Knox-dependent services.* Galaxy M series phones run One UI 'Core', so features like Good Lock, Bixby are not compatible.* Samsung phones generally struggle in network reception in areas where coverage is poor. If there's strong network coverage, then you won't notice any difference.Otherwise, it's a decent phone for at around 15k.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Pros:1. Great battery life. Reminiscent of the old nokia phones which never used to die.2. High quality display.3. Smooth and fluid performance.Cons:1. Fingerprint reader non-responsive sometimes2. Camera quality is only decent. Pro mode does not give much options like ability to adjust aperture and shutter speed. Maybe you can get access to those from some other app in the play store.3. Touch unlock available but not touch lock which could lengthen the life of the power button. Again have to depend on some play store app for this.Overall a great buy for anyone looking for fair performance and good battery life.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This phone is really a Mega monsterPros:- Android 10 (very fast and feels light while operating)- Stunning Display with Blue light filter (i always use the filter )- 4K video recording  UHD video 3840x2160.- 6 GB Ram enough to play most of the games- 6000 Mah battery is enough to get you through the day- Storage 128 GB (If you record 4k videos you need to get a memory card )- Fast charging with 15W brick (could have been faster but OK)- Mobile speakers sound is OK ( but not loud enough)- Camera is really good with 64 mp back and 32mp front- fingerprint sensor response is ok ( with sweaty hands you have to struggle)Cons:- Recording video with flash on the phone over heated and restarted with a message \"your phone is over heating\" (if thats a feature form Android 10 its okey to save the hardware)- you cannot zoom in or out in most camera modes (hope those can be fixed with an update)- no gestures to bring torch without unlocking phone (my previous phone has a dedicated music key which i assigned to torch)FeedbackA well built phone with good featuresI am happy I bought this phone :)\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  - Has 6000 mh battery but stand by time is very poor- Does not support volte or you can not access internet when you are on call.- Manual selection of operator does not stick, will move to automatic when you put it to airplan mode.- No compete 4G option in SIM card settings- charging speed is not as expected- touch is good- quality of the camera is satisfactoryCan go for it, if amazon releases it between 10 - 13 k\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  For the price this phone exceeds and performance is really great. Battery life is worth mentioning could go without charging for two days. Finger print reader is just great no hassles. Camera quality I found very good,  though professional reviewers mentioned low on low light, I found it otherwise, as it takes good pictures without any issues focus is not lost, flash is powerful enough to take those pics in absolute dark.I recommend anyone to buy the phone just closing their eyes. For price tag of 17K it is simply awesome no need to invest 25k, 35k for smartphone as it gives more features for the price of 17K\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Review after 4 days usage:The phone is very good in terms of what it offers for 16 thousand mid range segment. Pros,cons and final verdict below.Pros:1. Camera is solid. Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah3. Display is crisp and very sensitive4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.Cons:1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am a Samsung loyalist and upgraded from Galaxy A4 2017, my reliable workhorse. The new phone tries to be intuitive, many options for customization. BUT sound was v bad. Could not listen to music till I googled and added Samsung music app. Had to tweak sound for 60+ which I'm not, to hear phone calls. So many bells and whistles but Samsung forgot SOUND,  the basic.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Brought M31 128 gb variant . Phone looks great and display really nice. But battery  life is not seems to be like 6000mah . For simple usage YouTube videos,online songs- battery drains fast  .  I was using lg w30 as temporary mobile (3000mah)I feel that mobile backup was good.After some day will update my comments if any changes\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A SMALL REQUEST TO YOU DONT BUY THIS PHONE I AM THE REGULAR CUSTOMER OF SAMSUNG BUT NOW I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT SAMSUNG I  AM NOT HAPPY TO THIS PHONE\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Giving review after Using it for two days.  Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.Pros-1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.Average features-1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.Cons-1. No cover provided within the box.2. No headphones provided.3. No Samsung secure folder.4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. 👍\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I bought the Samsung M31 6GB 128GB version for 16k. I use mostly online shopping apps, Streaming apps, chat, video calls.Pros1. SAMOLED screen, Pleasing to look....2. Battery life, for me with moderate use it lasts for 2 days.3. Camera Front and Back. Especially I love the Front camera...For selfie lovers it is a boon. Back camera is good but I can spot some color deviations in pictures taken using back camera as the real color is not seen in picture. But for me it is not an issue as I not using it frequently.4. Stylish looks.5. No major heating issues as I could see persons having competitors mobiles are complaining a lot about this.6. Even after 20 to 30 drops I dont see any visible even minor damage to the screen or body. Very well built device.Cons,1. Finger peint sensor and face recognition takes bit longer time then competitors devices to detect.2. Plastic body behind is fingerprint magnet and also can be easily scratched with out case. I dont like using a case so it is a issue for me.Even if you use a case you have to choose a good quality one as the bad ones themselves leave some scratches in long use3. Charging time...I know it is directly proportional to battery capacity but bit more faster charging would have been handy. Tome charging times are 3 hours 15 mins with normal charging and 2 hours 35 mins with fast charging.4. Whenever there is a software update mobile also shows a list of recommended apps that should be installed to complete the update. This came skipped but still it is annoying.Gamers.. please forgive me as I am not going to mention anything regarding the gaming performance as I have never tried even a single game with this mobile.Mobile is worth the money and my Rating is easily above 4 but if metal case and bit more faster charging options are provided I will be happily rate it 5.Thanks for the patience to read the complete review.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Alert: This will be very common man review not a technical one so if you are looking for technical review kindly skip it.Samsung M 31 has been great buy owing to its monster battery  life. I am a new mom and purchased this mobile  when my infant was 2 months  old. The battery lasts pretty long even after playing multiple YouTube videos and being on long video calls (due to lockdown). I don't get time charge my phone properly though.Sound quality: The sound is loud and clear over calls and also during entertainment sessions of movies and video.Camera Quality: The reason I opted  this phone was I wanted  good camera to capture precious moments of my little one. So far it has been serving  the purpose. I can't comment for outdoor photography as we are all home bound owing to pandemic.Screen: The display colours and picture resolution is great owing to full HD Amoled Display. But Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is my savior as my mobile has been kicked and slipped multiple times (I am using it without a screen guard and back cover). Further  the Accidental Touch feature is awesome as I mostly  have an infant in hand while using the mobile.Body: The body is non slippery offering good grip but there will lot of finger impression left on back.Fingerprint Sensor: Only thing that doesn't  pleases me its fingerprint sensor quality which could have been better. It takes times sometimes  or I have place finger multiple times.Face recognition features works well for me and it unlocks the phone from various angles even when I am using spectacles( this becomes a problem in various other mobiles.)Overall I am happy  with the purchase so far after two months of use.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  After using it I find out that there is a network issue.

I was using the Oneplus 7T before. I am not a heavy gamer and use my device to binge-watch, click photos and use the social media apps so won't comment much on the performance. The camera to my surprise almost competed with 7T's even though it's half of it's price point.Pros:1. Camera - I find the camera to be pretty good at this price point. Both the front and back cameras have good depth. The macro camera could be a bit better but does the job for a budget smart phone. I have attached photos I clicked (clearly not a good photographer), the first is of a odd little spider using the macro camera, the 2nd and 3rd of the 64 MP camera and the 4th of the front camera2. Amoled display3. The battery life lasts for the full day easily even though I use my phone at long stretches.4. 2 sim card and an separate sd card holder - I am one of those people who watches a lot of classic movies and hence need the extra storage so this bodes well for me and I also have 2 phone numbers (work cell and personal cell)5. Not a Chinese brand.Cons-1. It's on the heavier side understandably with the 6000 mah battery2. The charger should have been at least of 25 amperes. This one takes me a good 1m5 hours to chargeOverall, I am really satisfied with the purchase.

I had read a similar review on Amazon about getting dust under plastic cover.Initially I suspected the cameras of the phone and the camera panel seems to be slightly displaced. Camera quality is the worst. My friend has the same phone but he's camera is good. I suspect that the original parts of this phone that I've received are siphoned. please please don't buy this phone from Amazon. They've got the worst retailers. Regretting buying this phone. The fingerprint sensor has stopped working. In just 2 months. The original parts of this phone have been removed. Like cameras and fingerprint sensor and speakers. Can't believe this. Couldn't return the phone as I didn't use it until a month after ordering.Also the face unlock feature doesn't work properly.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It's been a week that I bought my new Samsung galaxy M31 and gonna give a review on my experience.ProsCamera is just too awesome but I think these days many competitor phones have good camera quality.Battery goes more than 24hrs, I use comparatively less than an insta/fb/Twitter person, but more often I keep checking messages and few videos. With full charging, it says low battery after some 30 hours, so battery life is real great.ConsBut charging takes long time. Adapter has the Fast Charging sign, but to make us fool. It take around 2 hours for full charging which I feel is really long.Processor being Exynos and 6GB Ram, I feel the performance is quite poor. Phone is slow in operation. Not satisfying.Fingerprint sensor ain't that great. Sometimes fails to detect my finger and sometimes takes time.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  \\xa0The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support.I'm giving this review after using 1 week.Pros:Camera : The Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup at the back and a single 32-megapixel selfie shooter. The primary camera on the Galaxy M31 has a 64-megapixel resolution and f/1.8 aperture. This camera takes 16-megapixel binned shots by default but you can switch to the full resolution. There's also an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree field of view and an f/2.2 aperture.Battery : I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again. 2.5 hours to full chrage.Games:If you are a professional gamer, I suggest you to go for MI brand. MI provides slightly better graphics. Overall gaming experience is nice on M31Cons:Nothing as of now.  Note : When I plugged into charging phone will slightly heatup.I bought it 2  Phones as 6GB and 8GB with 128GB storage.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Battery: I play games such scrabble go, Jurassic park, and few others. And often use my phone to read.Before this I had Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 (5000 mah).  Comparing the two with same amount of activity, I found Samsung Galaxy M31's 6000 mah lacking.I have seen a lot of complains about the the camera clarity and the battery.Camera: The camera is pretty decent. Includes, slow motion, super slow motion, hyper lapse, macro, etc.But don't put on blinders, purchase this phone with the knowledge that the battery isn't up to the mark.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is the best phone that I was able to find with comes with a brand guarantee.. I mean I get it mi and other brands are putting alot of effort but their is a reason samsung is doing the best. The quality of the phone doesn't feel cheap it's fells like the money you paid for. The phone fit just quite right in my hands and was easy and smooth to handle... The fucntions were great and finger print was quick. Also, the camera is fantastic which gives you the absolute focus and it's endless camera features just adds up to its charm\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Excellent product by Samsung at this price point. Worth every penny you spend. 64mp camera is awesome, it really takes some stunning photos. SAmoled screen is crisp and clear. Battery performance for moderate usage for someone like me can work 2days.I am using Redmi note 7 pro from last 1 year, but this is certainly best in terms of performance as compared to Mi phones.Finger print reader is also fast. The SAR value of this phone is also very low (0.3) as compared to other high value phones. Without any doubts this is the best budget phone right now in the market.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  So many issues with this phone. 3.5 mm jack stopped reading mic, the port is fine it's the software issue. The phone doesn't charge often, again software issue. They are pushing updates but these problems persist from the beginning. Please check for bugs in your software Samsumg before releasing or advertising your products. It's better for you to change lanes from here and see for other options, you will save yourself from several headaches.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Galaxy M31 is an awesome phone. The camera quality is superb. The phone has ease of access. Touch sensor is amazingly smooth. Since I was using some Chinese phone earlier, I could easily make out the difference. All the apps have country of origin mentioned in it (not sure if other phones have it, my earlier one didnt have it) Although I am not so tech savy, but found this phone one of the best phones till date with affordability (got a hot deal for old phone exchange as well🤩). All and all a recommended phone who are looking for a budget deal 🙂\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Excellent  phone and very much satisfied with the features of the phone.  The camera is too good and battery life is awesome. This proven again as Samsung is best in its quality.  The camera inbuilt AI features are very helpful and easy to use.  Overall I taken the right decision choosing this phone and that too with so many features within the reasonable budget.  I do recommend to my friends to go ahead buy this phone.  I also appreciate Amazon service who delivered this phone with in agreed time.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Pro.Great DisplayGreat battery lifeGood finger print scanGreat cameraGood overall look, weight, custom UICornCharger need to be more Watt.Back cover finger print magnetNo inbuilt screen recorderOverall it's a great deal if you don't want to buy a Chinese phone in this price segment from Samsung.Go for Indian or other brands ,but don't go for Chinese brand.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Good choice go-ahead.I noticed touch sensitive been improved, the phone become quite responsive, good job Samsung....Good things :Crisp AMOLED displayExcellent battery lifeDecent performanceGood photo quality in daylightBad things :Disappointing low-light camera performance Thank you AMAZON for this prizeless gift from you at the time of corona pandemic.Last but not least, thank you for well packing and fast shipping by seller and AMAZON facility.Thank you...\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Perfect mix of hardware and software to perform not just daily tasks with ease but also performance heavy tasks with ease. The display is beautiful and bright inside and easily visible under the sun also. The camera is one of the best in its category with a quad camera configurable with pixel density upto 64 megapixel. The OneUI from Samsung is intuitive, responsive and convenient to use. Best is that the device is 'Made in India' :) ... a highly recommended phone. The only con is the front camera could have been a 'pin-hole' form factor but then one easily gets used to the 'U-cut' camera form-factor in a matter of a few days.Overall a must have device and highly recommended on all fronts - good camera / display / processing / battery / looks.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I got the delivery much before the scheduled time. Thanks to Amazon.Samsung been my favorite handset. I used samsung m30 earlier and so m31 seems similar looks wise. For now the camera is superb. It's a fun experience. I totally loved and trying to explore more.Im not a heavy user but still find the battery life is not like what it been claimed.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  There are several pros for M31. But since it's already covered by other reviewers and YouTube videos, I'll instead point out some not-so-common cons (if at all you can call them cons!)1. The phone does not come with a backcover and it is a fingerprint magnet. So you would need to buy a backcover for aesthetics.2. Not water resistant (is that asking too much?😅)3. It does take a bit of time to get fully charged. But once that's done, it'll easily last for more than a day.4. The earphone slot is at the bottom of the phone. I personally like it on the top. Again, it wouldn't be a bother if you use a Bluetooth earphone/headset. :)5. This might not be the phone for heavy gamers.I haven't found any other problem after a month's usage.Overall, I totally recommend this phone. 😊P.S - I saw some reviews saying the camera quality is poor. I disagree to it as I feel it's really good.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  After using almost 50 days , First let me tell about the seller, I have read a lot of negative reviews and even I was scared that whether I\\'ll receive a genuine productor not. They even took 6 days to deliver but \"it was better late than never\" and I received a Awesome product.Coming to the device, it\\'s the best that Samsung could provide with all these features for this price range (almost a flagship kind of feel).Processor - at first I felt that it was bit slow, but after a use of a day or two, I could realize that it was learning your daily usage pattern and it delivers a smooth performance.Camera - best quality images from all the cameras in good lighting conditionFingerprint sensor - if you think it as slow, you\\'re wrong, it\\'s just very accurateBattery - you can survive more than a day with normal usageDisplay - I\\'m a fan; crisp display and the punch hole camera doesn\\'t interfere with your entertainment, you almost feel it as invisibleOverall it\\'s an Awesome device; You\\'ll have a great feel with this device\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have been using samsung galaxy m31 since last 6 months and i can say that this is one of the best option to have a perfect smartphone at this price range....Pros1. Display is great with AMOLED2. Camera is top class3. Usability and screen touch is quite smooth4. fingerprint works best5. Battery is really a monster and can easily survive for at least 35 to 40 hrs..6. RAM and memory management is done pretty well on thisCons1. Exynos 9611 processor which not quite suitable for gamers but i dont complain personally2. Should have given fast charger considering its battery capacity as it takes around 2 hours 35 min approx to charge fully3. Initially i did faced some issues with device restart but then with some seetings of optimization, its working pretty well..I would definitely recommend this device to users who use smartphones for day to day use except heavy gamers...pleasedo check attached images for camera quality...ThanksGovardhan.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A very awesome mobile, a complete  value for money.Main highlights are its awesome display, battery and performance.One can argue with the performance when u take gaming into account. But believe  me even in gaming its performance  is awesome.Its a daily life phone, awesome super amoled display for entertainment ,6000MAH battery for continuous work and decent performance.The thing i dont liked that much...1. Camera pic output...some are good some are not natural, its seems artificial.2. No fast charging support..it takes nearly 2hr 45 mins to charge it completely.These are not major negatives about this phone if compare at the price its been offered.GO AHEAD FOR IT.....👍👍👍👍👍\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Good mobile at 15-16k.Good battery,Good soundRear Camera good but not like 64 mpFront camera good but not seems like 32 mp.Heavy in weight as battery is hugeDisplay is goodPortrait mode of camera is goodBattery backup is greatOverall  good.....\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  1.Style outdated2.

I don't play games so wont like quoting on that part\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Overall a nice smartphone by samsung and different one too to be considered as value for money product.Battery life is excellent.But there should have given above 20watt fast charger which is not there.This time samsung nailed it.But in this price there should've given some more features which I think would be better.But overall in this price range it can be considered as good..If you've budget of nearly 17000,surely go for it .\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Best in size with amoled display.Excellent delivery by Amazon within 24 hrs.Mega powerhouse in hand.Best in smooth processor.With 64 mp camera, quadcore camera setup is good and macro photography is best.No problem of overheating while using or charging.Fast charging is good.Totally a best phone with the price.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Camera is good and fingerprint reader is also good. But if your expectations are smooth experience on mobile screen then this is not the right mobile. There is a lag in between touching the screen and it's processing of the sameNot sure what's the use of 6 gb RAM if the processor itself is not capable enough.But if your budget is only this much the go for this. I didn't experience redmi mobile so it's better to operate both mobiles by yourelf and take a decision.Don't buy looking at 6+128gb combination.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Fingerprint reader is awesome both in its view and working.Camera quality isnt as we can say 64 mp but the wide angle it creates and captures is awesome. Selfie camera is thumbs up.Baterry life was the primary thing i went for and in this range this battery pickup is great.The touchscreen, smooth touch, sleek and classy look is more than the price.No heating problem, no hanging problem, bit of network connectivity problem probably due to the operator.I would have given 4 straightaway. But .5 is to be added for the low price range and .5 is to be cut for the not so 64 camera quality. So i go with 4.5*\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Received mobile but after 2days mobile screen gone black, i guess manufacturing defect, service agent came and checked but no use, i have return that piece,  but unfortunately my personel data is captured in that mobile, after 1 week i got mail that some one tried to login to my mail which my passwords stored in that mobile, i am shocked, i changed all my passwords immediately, be careful before return defective piece, erase all your personel data,  amazon delivery service is good.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  VALUE BUYING AT 17499 WITH EXCHANGE OF INFINIX HOT 8 WORTH 4800 SO IT IS GOOD FOR ME .Q6000 MAH BATTERY IS NOT TRUE IT WON'T  WORK FOR MORE THAN 1 DAY FOR NORMAL USERS LIKE ME WHO DO EVERYTHING ON PHONE TWITTER/FB/MARKETS , NO .CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD FOR THIS SERIES .PHONE IS GOOD IN HANDS.MADE IN INDIA _ NON CHINESE WAS MY FIRST CONCERN SO I PICKED THIS ONE .BUDGET PHONE-BETTER CAMERA- BATTERY WORKS LIKE 4000 MAH SO IT'S GOOD PICK.PHONE GOT HANG AFTER USING 7 DAYS , EDITING MY REVIEW BECAUSE PHONE GOT A ISSUE IN RAM USE OR SOMETHING THEY NEED TO WORK ON , PHONE RESTARTS AUTOMATICALLY, LAG IS THERE.YOU MAY BUY IF YOU WANT NON CHINESE BETTER BUDGET PICK ,\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Pros -Really good cameraI do not play games so the processor is just fine for meGorgeous displayLow SARGreat batterCons -This issue is maybe present only in my phone but sometimes the fingerprint reader doesn't work.

Front camera doesn’t seems like your using one of those picture enhancer app(youCam), I understand that’s for good looking self portraits but they seem like Photoshoped by amateur!! But the rest seem great!! Back camera is excellent, macro lens is great, Display awesome, Samsung UI is smooth and reliable, performance is good too. Best thing about the phone is the absence of the creepy chinese apps & games on it!!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Battery life is excellent. Camera is pretty good, too.  Quite happy with the performance over the last two weeks or so.Overall, a value for money phone. Is Made in India, too. You should consider for phones under rs.20,000.I decided to buy this phone after quiite a lot of research. And Im quite happy with the decision.  Hope this helps.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I would say this is a better phone as compare to Redmi note 9 pro max. The reason is very subjective but I will try to answer few of them.The first and foremost is the premium look and feel of this phone which is unlike the Redmi note 9 pro max. The next is the camera quality it’s really outperform as compare to anything which rate me as to offer. Next the overall hamlet screen over here is much better as compare to redmi note 9 pro max.Lastly it all depends on how much you have to spend on a given phone but having a Samsung phone can always give you assurance that it will last long at least an year or two more as compare to any other brand.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This phone is bizzare.PROSProcessor is fine.Design feels solid and the phone is good to hold in hand.The UI is also quite good.The camera is 64mp and won't fail you.The selfie camera is 32mp and is pretty good.Pubg does not lag and runs smoothly.The sAMOLED display is the highlight of the phone.CONSThe phone has bloatware.The finger sensor is on the back. I would have preferred an onscreen one or on the power button in this price range.The phone is thicker than the A series.I am not a fan of notch and would have preferred a punch hole instead.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  When you run apps, the screen display gets crammed, one line sits over another and not legible.Otp screens are a problem, it does not clearly come out and you cannot do a proper bank transaction through third party apps which call the merchant banking system.E.g. Uber/Zomato orders/payments call merchant banking and needs otp validation. You never can do it on M31. Otp screen goes in the background.Finally end up paying everything in cash.Worst mobile and not worth the money you spent.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This phone is good but the problem is that it heats during charging..... and everything is ok\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Battery Life Its good but not as expected , I am not a heavy user, not a gamer, but it need to be charge once in a day, and it took 1:30 hrs to get it charge completelyFingerprint Sensor is Good 4/5Camera Quality is good no complaintsBig disappointment is Dolby Sound which is of no use, you on it or off it there is not much difference\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Phone is good and for this much money it is value for money.Hangs quite a lot while playing graphics game like COD. Front camera is not good but Rear one is really good and captures images with good quality.Battery backup is ok type not so good although this is 6k mah phone.UI is awesome and quite yser friendly. RAM is not so good and I found no difference in performance with 4 gb RAM.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  It\\'s been just 3 weeks since i bought this phone.When it comes to midrange models samsung has always been a good choice.Its performance and other features are always been decent.Galaxy M31 has some of the good features too.The First and the best thing about this phone is its display.Its 6.4\" super amoled display is awesome! Touch experience is butter smooth.If you watch lot of movies & videos then this phone is a right choice for you.Bcoz I watch lot of movies so its display quality is really great!It has a massive 6000mah battery which gives you a good battery life. I used to watch offline movies without break for more than 2 hours but the charge only decreases 10%.I think it\\'s really great! But if you are using social media and play games a lot or surfing internet for a long time then it gives you a decent battery life of 1 day or less.This is not for heavy gamers.Pls keep in my mind the charging time is too long.It charges only 34% in 1 hour.So it surely takes 2 and half hours to charge from 0 to100%.Even though they have given an Adaptive Fast Charger it charges slowly.Due to its heavy battery and 8.9mm thickness I thought it would be bulky but surprisingly it doesn\\'t feel heavy or bulky in hand.Thanks to its curvy finish.Cellular call quality is good.It has a single Speaker which is loud and audible.Sound through ear phone also really good.Camera takes decent photos.It has got wide angle and macro too.I have posted some sample shots here .Color Saturation is good.Camera has some more features which I haven\\'t used it yet.Selfie camera is good. When it comes to performance I would say it\\'s not bad at all.I haven\\'t seen any stutter or lag so far.Gaming performance is also good.I am not a fan of PUBG so I haven\\'t installed it.I have Real Racing 2 which played really good without any lag. Some of them has said in their review that the phone has some heating issues but in my experience the phone doesn\\'t heat much while playing games or watching movies or doing any other task.It gets heat while charging but it\\'s normal I think.In this price range you can get lot of other brands with very good spec.But at the end of the day its SAMSUNG.Due to its brand value the pricing is high for this specs.So finally its user\\'s choice to go for what they wish.Overall the phone is good in all aspect.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Beautiful screen with vibrant colours and a wonderful battery life is all I needed and Samsung galaxy delivers it to the dot. No compromises there on the humongous 6000 all day long or should I say all 2 days long battery. And the screen is brilliant with popping colours and eligible under sun.The blacks are deep as it should be on an amoled. Decent gaming is welcome. And the camera is no slouch the quad cam setup comes up with the best of modes. So when you go online with your pictures you don't feel bad at all. Camera has been done rightly. When you can watch Netflix in Full HD there are not a lot of phones providing this option in this segment.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have ordered this mobile on 20/07/2020 and got delivery on time i.e. 24/07/2020. I have chosen M31, 8 Gb RAM version. Earlier I have used Motorola mobiles (which are good and rugged one) and this is my first Samsung mobile and I think I have made a good decision. Rest time will tell in long term use but first impression is great.So list of Positive points:1. Battery is very of good rating 6000 mAh. i do cycle rides using strava which uses GPS continually and to my surprise after using strava app for nearly 5 and half hour which include clicking photos dropped battery level from 100 % to 75% only. Which I think is very genuine.2. Processor is fast and efficient with almost no lag.3. Camera is definitely a plus point of this mobile. It will not disappoint you.4. RAM size is good as per today’s usage and I have opted for 8 Gb RAM so that in future after updates no issue arises. Other wise 6 Gb is also fine if you are going out of budget. (Here I want to mention that I am not a mobile gamer)5. Super amoled screen by Samsung is just awesome.6. User interface is very good with many good options and it will enhance core android experience. You can uninstall or hide default apps that you do not like on your mobile.7. Internal Memory is enough i.e. 128 Gb over that you get a dedicated micro SD card slot so that is impressive.8. Finger print sensor works very fast and efficiently.Now coming to negative points from my point of view1. Volume of loud speaker is bit less. If finger or something else comes over speaker it reduces volume drastically.One neutral point is that it comes with a battery charger of 15 watts only which is bit low for 6000 mAh battery but at same time very fast charging is not good for life of battery. May be Samsung engineers did what is best for their product.Final words \"It’s a good mid range mobile by Samsung with impressive performance”\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  DISLIKES:I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product  Defects:No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:-headphone audioJack not working-caller audio receiver not working-speaker not workingVideos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2× speed.Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.LIKES:Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.WHO can Buy:-Camera is priority-Wants some bigger battery-day to day regular usage-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wiselyPHONE WONT' SATISFY:-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.-onscreen finger print sensor-A51Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.For this price,this is a real mega monster.REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer's😁\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is my 3rd phone in Galaxy series. Galaxy series from Samsung is widely known for great phones with great features, but this one M31, is great even from Budget point of view. I did purchase on First Day First Show, when this was launched. Reason is number of reviews I had read on YouTube. Almost 20+ reviews I checked. I also read number of issues on Samsung forum / various blogs/forum etc. Every piece of information convinced, this is the best phone in this budget. Extreme value for Money.My smartphone journey has been quiet diverse in terms of various companies, so I am able to compare / differentiate various features, with hands on experience.From Year 2012 : Samsung Galaxy S2 > HTC Incredible 2 > HTC Rhyme > Samsung Galaxy Note 2 > LG G Vista > LG G6 > Redmi Note 3 > LG Q6 > Redmi Pro 6 > Samsung M31 : To year 2020.Following is my experience with M31, after a month of usage.Good: (for M31)- Android 10! Great looking version & beautifully customized by Samsung. Even in 10th edition, Samsung was fast to roll out update.- Mammoth display, my kids can actually use it properly for school online classes, as screen is sufficient when viewed from near distance.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 mAh battery is NEED of the times, with so much dependence on online activities. I use it full day + almost half of the time on HOT spot. Still, battery works for a 1.5 to 2 days. Charging is very fast, but not ultra fast. 30 min can increase around 50% battery.- Both the SIM support 4G (that’s plus), as we can practically use 2 JIO SIM for almost double the data, without any switchover.- Separate SD Card (up to 512 GB), actually is a great feature. Existing memory of 128 GB is sufficient as of now & SD cards (high capacity) are not cheap as such. So, Samsung did a right thing to provide enough memory from beginning.- Mobile speakers is good for normal music (less bass) & conference call. You actually feel part of the room, when conference call over speaker.- Camera is really good. So many features re there & I am yet to fully know them, as my basic usage is not for photography, but my children makes great video from this phone.- Figure-print sensor response is good, but when finger is moist due to sweat / water, it doesn’t response. That’s problem with all the phone, but the moment you wipe your finger, you are good to go. Response time is ultra fast.- Thanks Amazon for delivering within 3 days, even in partial lock down conditions.Not So Good: (for M31)- Not thin & light. Additionally, I have put up a sturdy cover + glass, so weight increased heavily. After few days you get used to it.- Doesn’t come with Samsung Security feature (like other galaxy series premium phone). However, Samsung does offer S-Secure app to lock certain apps with finger scan.- To many Samsung related apps (like global goal etc) & many of them are still to be known what it does. But Samsung can reduce such apps to save memory. You can disable few of them.- SMS can’t be deleted with a swipe (like in case of redmi),that’s important as many of the OTP/temporary messages should be deleted to reduce clutter.- Mobile torch can’t be switched of with a phone power button. This is a required feature, instead of going to notification & switch off torch.-- No light sensor in front, as it helps to avoid call going in hold during conversation. I read on Samsung forum, that front camera is used, so we have to hold phone in particular normal angle, that will ensure that call doesn’t get disturbed. Now, little used to it.- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. Apps run like butter & it never gives a message of storage space running out, in spite of heavy storage.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.If you are looking for a sub 20k feature rich phone, go for M31/Samsung. As it is far batter than any other Chinese options available, which are good in flashy advertisement, but in long run performance, they can’t match Samsung. I have been user of\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I bought this product on 18/03/20.It has 32MP selfie camera which is best at this price range. 4K video by 64MP camera is amazing. Exynos 9611 is a very good processor and you can put limit(70%) on it by turning on power saving mode. You don't need to charge for two days because it has massive 6000mah battery. Samsung mobiles always come with it's premium Super AMOLED screen which has very nice color rendering capability. I always like Samsung products because Samsung has largest manufacturing facility in India.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was a Samsung C9pro user for past 3 years , the migration to M31 was pretty easy with smart switch, other than few credit card apps none of the  other apps recognise the move, face unlock it works and it doesn't, phone battery stays for one and half day with dual SIM,  figner print scanner improved a lot, camera is also better with correct light, phone casting to TV is not crashing , however  photo quality when we view on a 4k TV is not great, android auto also much stable, Bluetooth connectivity with both smart watch and car works seamlessly.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  battery:- really a monster little bit slow charge they should give at least 25w charger but okay in thus price rangecamera:-no comparison with the competitive other phones this phone is true winnerweight distribution:- samsung is samarter day by day weight of phone nthng if u see from battery sideDisplay:-samoled is a real winner this is way better than tft panel or lcd it provides a very smooth user experience to u really appreciableUI:-ui 1 i like customised ui of this phone personally i love stock android but this on is really gud i enjoyed it they give us a numerous option to customise the phone according to ur comforabiltiyprocessor:- is gud enough fo day to day use they may give udated but its okayfinishing of back panel from side is sexiest thing of this i love the way they finished its sides riund types feel when u hold it in ur hands\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Before buying I got very good reviews online but only after buying I found problems. network issue is frequently trouble. Internet would just go out suddenly for few seconds, camera quality good but video auto focus has some issue. Speed wise also so so...don't know what 6gb ram does as not as fast as expected and hangs if too many apps opened..overall except camera I couldn't find it much better than my old moto x4\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  As visible from the other reviews, it is a good phone, I just wanted to concentrate on some \"not so good\" points for users for whom these might be of particular relevance:- if you turn on the router-wifi (hotspot) forget about using the bluetooth connection, the sound comes and goes- if the wifi signal is weak i get the info \"Ready to connect when network quality improves\" in the same location where i could still use the wifi, even if very weakly, with my previous phone.- I was expecting more from the battery, it does not last for two full days.Otherwise I am very happy.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Lovely phone. The amazing battery life and the vivid, bright screen more than make up for some apparent shortcomings. Another interesting feature is a macro camera.. the wide angle camera is very good too. The basic camera has excellent low light capability and gives a bright image (is it the screen or the camera?).. in short the camera(s) perform much better than expected.And the phone feels solid.The battery again is just great. What's the point having lots of features and not being able to use them? The battery makes them available and reliable. I think this is the first smartphone around with acceptable battery life. For a 15K phone (introductory price), this is real good! Great job Samsung. And nice delivery Amazon, I received it the day before the lock down!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Look and feel : Heavy but HandyCamera: Perfect for its price, both front and back, stability in video is commendableBattery: Just a big battery, that's why it lasts for 1 and half day with standard usage, it's not optimized for maximum performance and backup.Processor: even with octacore processor, Chrome and YouTube have hanged even with Normal usage, so won't say it's a great one, it's fine for standard usageCharging and Charging Cable: Charging speed is decent, Samsung has provided such a short cable, it's not appropriate, Samsung Customer care claims Samsung is providing 150cm cable, while in reality they are providing 75cm long cable only\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  On the 11th day of delivery  of phone, sound of main speaker  get down. I don't know why but it's not very low. Even I can't hear the ringtone. Over all phones built quality is awesome as well outstanding camera performance.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This one is the best when I bought this in the sub-20k price range.Maybe the newly launched M31s is the only that can best it.Spec wise even better than A series which is the next grade of Samsung.Good screen, good camera, good battery life. Multiple unlock options with face and fingerprint. Latest Android version. What more can you ask.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I had a horrible experience after buying Samsung M31 immediately after it's launch. The screen display got non-functional just in three months of usage. My display got blacked out just in two minutes while I was watching video. Screen went completely black as if it's switched off. The mobile didn't have any physical damage and mishandling. There was not a single game installed and I used the mobile during lockdown just for calling and and watching videos. When I contacted the Samsung service center they called it's liquid damage called bleeding and it comes under physical damage and therefore I will have to bear the repairing charges of display change which is 5000 rs. I am really disappointed with the service and company policy where the consumer is exploited for non-functioning of mobile even though it happened on its own. Buying such an expensive mobile which doesn't work for few months is really not acceptable and company should take a note of that and act accordingly in favour of the consumer. Substandard products are being made and delivered to the customer and charged in the name of policy terms and conditions.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This phone has worse camera in slow motion. After that 6000 mah battery is fake thing it seems to be 4000 only. And in the last but not the least u cant hear other person voice while u r doing calls. Its my worse experience for samsung phone.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I don't know where to start speaking about this amazing phone and its amazing features.Samsung has truly given us a gift with the M31 model.The monster battery of 6000 MaH is definitely the higight, but apart from the amazing battery we need to take out time to appreciate how beautifully Samsung has balanced the weight of this huge battery in this handy phone without it being bulky. It is truly crazy!I have been using this phone for a little over a week now, and I am just in love with everything it has to offer.The camera quality is just amazing, people just need to make sure that they set the default output of the pics at 64 Mp as the phone naturally clicks pics at 16 Mp mode to save space.I love that my phone is add free (which is such a relief!) And all the other features are just so fun to use!This phone is seriously a SNATCH at the price Samsung has introduced it. The best of features at such a great deal.Just go for it without a blink if you are looking for a phone under 20000.This is truly a treat to use. You wont regret it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Fingerunlock work just fine but little wet then less response battery is descend cam ..hmm i thought it is 64 MP haha ..but pic is just fineIts well over 02 of usage, no hangup smooth touch .multifunfions doing well but when hoping frm good network area to less net area n coming out frm there ...to again full net area ..the phone behave very slow# needs to restart again for good reception of network ..i dont knw why but it happens almost all time ..small game just fine but not for heavy gamers ..Even with soft back cover ..phone back colour is fading out ..very disappointed about its poly ..whatsoever materialOtherwise the phone is doing good in this budget.🙂\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Just purchased samsung Galaxy M31 - 8 GB RAM-128 GB Storage 2 days back. different screens on the phone are opening without touching the touch screen once we open one function. If we open keypad for dialing numbers automatically 3 no digit will get enter so many times like-wise for whatsapp if we open one scrap other scraps containing photo or any message will open several time. Even after pressing return button it continues to work similarly. Disappointed with this problem. Need suggestion what o do My mobile number is 8087039916\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Average phone.System is not compatible with other launchers.1. In Navigation Bar 》Full Screen Gesture is not working with Microsoft, Nova and poco launchers.2. There is no shortcut for flash light. (Like press lock key 2 times to on or off / shake devices to on or off.)3. Many devices have screen shot  shortcut/ Gesture  like swipe download through 3 fingers ant it ll take screen shot. Samsung is most powerful devices this feature should have in this devices too..4. Sounds quality is very poor in wired earphone. I jave compared with many devices with same earphone Samsung is very bad in all others. Dolby atmos is not good in Samsung.  Lenovo K4 note gives more output then Samsung.  Poor bass in Samsung.5. When I start snapchat app it will take more time to load and run camera. Other brands phone works well in this price and specifications.6. Screen quality and brightness is good.7. There is full coverage of network still its shows out of coverage area many time. I have tried in jio and airtel. Same issue for both.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The mobile is a wonderful all rounder. Overall performance  is very smooth.Touch is buttery, nice to work with. Display is vibrant, text is readable in bright sunlight,too.6.5 inch super amoled display is mere pleasure to look at. Enjoy movies, read text or pictures it is joyful.Camera quality is very good, especially in the light image colours are  vivid and vibrant you get lot of settings and features for back camera .selfie are good too ,but a little brighter .speaking about the performance there are no lags in day to day work., Thoughit's not for the heavy Gamers .coming to the special feature ,it has a massive 6000mh battery. you can go along two days with normal usage .For heavy users it can last a day long quite easily.fingerprint scanner is very fast and responsive Face Unlock is a bit lazy but you can manage call quality is goodand you get a very clear voice it's easy hold in  hand  and has a good grip feels very comfortable.Overall for rupees 16500 it's a great bargain, especially with 6gb of Ram and 64GB of memory the variant I've got.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  the product is not satisfy to me. I feeling that my money has wast. this is cheated me. now start form front camera. front camera is 64 MP by company but it is not like 64 MP but it is like 32 MP camera and back camera is 32 MP told by company but it is showing 21MP in the camera setting and it is shocking that the camera is not like 21mp but like 16MP camera. Now come to battery oh god it is horrible that the battery is like 3000 mAh. I want to ask to company why are you cheated to customer. Why?\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  After about a month of usage I have come across some pros and cons of this handsetPros :Good cameraExcellent displayGood build qualityGood soundGood microphoneExcellent voice recording qualityExcellent video recording qualityReally fastCons :The battery life is good but does not give service lyk 6000 mahThe phone takes a bit to restartThe camera doesnt have manual focus in expert modeThe Iso control is not efficient in manual camera modeSometimes hangs a bit and out of nowhere starts playing youtube even when phone is locked but it has happened only once.The back is very dullOverall a good smartphone to have. Functioning is quite satisfying. Most importantly, a very good smartphone in this range and it is made in India as well.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  64mp camera is not that good. Its image orocessing for 64mp is bad. It is like drawed picture more or less when you zoom more. Its colours are not that real and it doesnt feel that good to take 64mp photo. Its battery is good but at the first charge it took ages for me to get 100 percent. But after that it got quicker i.e it got to its original speed of charge. Software and its ui looks premium and good. There is a little lag while you fast open recent apps ( You can see it rarely, but for some apps u see it for sure). But overall its good. You will see some features which are that useful to you but when you see it will feel good. I think samsung does it because it wants yo make us feel luxury( but luxury in the sense not that useful but it is there) and honestly it feels good to have it. You will feel it good, simple, elegant to have it in your hand.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I had ordered this phone on the day of launch. I got it very next day .Appreciate the quick delivery by amazon. I have been using this phone since a week . It has been a really good experience so far.Pros:Battery life is really good and stays for a day without chargingCamera quality is amazing.Smooth touch screen and quick response in  the UIThe UI part of Android 10 is quite amazing.The sound quality is ok .Finger print sensor is very effective.Performance is really good.Cons:Sometimes phone gets heated up.They could have given ear phones and a back cover .The packaging by amazon was very average.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  In this price, the phone is superb! Mainly camera & battery of the phone is very good in price renge. Big screen gives you amazing experience of 4k videos. I ordered for blue colour but its not actually blue. Other features are great according to value. One con is the back panel. Back panel made from plastic so its have too many scratches on it. Buy a back cover along with phone is must. Go for it, love this product. Dilevery is too fast. Thank you!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Full HD AMOLED screen the best feature of this phone.6000mah battery lasta for at least two days.Camera quality is also good.Only downside could be the Exynos processor, but will not bother you, if you don't intend to play high end games.Finally Samsung has produced a cost effective product without compromising quality to take on the Chinese onslaught.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was using a Nokia phone from last 1 year however it started giving me charging problems so I decided to get a new phone but lockdown was going on in the country and everyone was boycotting Chinese products so I was really in a delima on which phone to pick up on, did a lot of searches on web to find which one I should for I don't know why after reading everything about other phones in my mind I had a trust building for this Samsung M31, my friends were giving me suggestions about other phones but I ordered this phone because of its massive battery and smooth in using every feature. I hope my trust remains as it is. I have promoted this phone in my friends and we all have same phones with different colors.  This phone has win my heart..\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  \\xa01.Finger print reader is fine.2.Though the quality of camera is not so good being a 64 mp camera, But it is worth the amount you pay for mobile. Yo can not expect Sony camera in M series mobile.3. Over all performance of mobile seems good. More ever this is an non Chinese mobile and I like it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Awesome camera, Review is not really nessessary to Samsung camera, from galaxy grand till now they never let you complain about camera, shared wide angle and micro camera quality, And I'm really not good in photography.When its come to battery i cannot complain I'm really a smartphone addict and never put my phone down. And till the time i have it on my hand it never run out of battery, i put this to charge when i go to sleep. Fast charging really works awesome if you forget to charge it and wanted to have some battery before leaving the home.Fingerprint is multifunctional and work very smoothly. There are other features in phone which really works awesome.Device care is awesome app so you do not need those third party advertisers cum cleaner.5 🌟 on everything. Nothing got to be complain as of now.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Just WOWWWW!!! Superb Battery Back up, Awsome Camera clarity, Awsome Pictures clicked, Great Processor, Large Memory, Smooth and fast Finger reader etc. Samsung is my all time favouite brand and I never used any other brand.

Worked good for 7 -8 days and now continuously getting hanged and UI hanging. This started happening after migrating all data from old phone. Since its more than 10 days now, and I was not aware of return policy . Stuck up with a defective product. No help from Amazon just suggested to visit Service station. I especially ordered from Amazon thinking during Covid times all necessary help would be provided in case of any issue or defect.Pathetic product and horrible service Amazon. Will have to think in future before order phone or any digital product from here.Very bad return policy .\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The camera and display are excellent.  I am absolutely fine using a regular fingerprint reader , as midrange indisplay fingerprint reader sucks in midrange samsung phones.Battery life is decent,  you csn leave a lot of things turned on.The phone takes a lot of time to boot up , not sure why.Charging is pretty slow compared  other quick charging Samsung phones.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  One of the worst experience with any mobile brand.. Not expected from at least Samsung.. earlier I had used Le 2, Lenovo, micromax, Infinix, realme, xiomi and currently I am using Honor and IPhone 7.. every experience was a charm but this time, it’s very disappointing..Coming to Samsung M31, purchased it a month ago.. 7 days back the mobile started behaving abnormally.. it’s touch stopped working frequently and at times, the mobile started operating and clicking on different parts of the screen on its own..I went to Samsung service Center and they told that it might be software problem and so they went for a software reinstallation.. I got the mobile after that and it started working fine, but again the next day, the same problem arised..Now they are telling that it might be the problem of the motherboard and I have to wait for few days,,This is pathetic.. Samsung this experience is like chilli .. let’s see what the Samsung guys do in the next coming days..\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Worth the buy best product on this price range. The HD screen is big n clear, fingerprint works perfectly gone, camera is good with lots of inbuilt options...and the best part is the battery life...for normal usage the batery stays almost more than a day!!! One more plus I am given to understand Samsung has manufacturing unit in india n other countries apart from China, so at least my phone is not made in china.....\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Recvd the phone today in the afternoon, kept it for recharge for an hour or so, replicated the data of the previous damaged phones, did some calls and in the evening suddenly the phone touch screen refuses to respond.have to go for the replacement of the sampe phone with the same model as no other option exists to get he money back.samsung M30 was an awesome product, unfortunately the screen got cracked... thought the M31 will be at par.Samsung needs to pull up on the quality. chose samsung as it is an made in India product.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Best in class.I am using Samsung J7 (2015 model ) from Jan'16 and it still gives beast performance till date May'20.So I believe Samsung always deliver best to customer.I read M31 specification and found my expectation  matches with it.Battery life is excellent.Charged 100% and after 6 hrs of video play, It jus drop 81%.Played games as well size of 4GB, No lag or heating issue.Camera quality is very good.So,Here it is #M31.Go for it #M31.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I got the delivery of the phone 2 days after its launch, so this review covers my experience of about 3 months-1. Screen - The Display is superb to say the least. sAMOLED display makes watching videos a delight!2. Camera - Few modes and video shooting in both rear and front camera is great. The enhancements dont make the photos look artificial which is great! However, can improve on the 64 MP mode - probably on OTA update can fix it.3. Battery - I have used phones with 5000 mAH battery for the last 2-3 years from Asus (Max series) - If I would rank that 5/5 because they would easily last 1.5 days without charge, this would be 4 +0.5 /5 ( 0.5 for fast charging, even if battery drains out fast). A full charge can last the day.  This is when I have medium to heavy usage of phone without gaming.4. Processing - Very smooth for 6GB, no lags whatsover!5. Some modes and features -•Dolby Atmos Sound mode for headsets is amazing!• Game mode has lots of features related to screen like screen recording, etc.• Fingerprint scanner is super fast too. Haven't tried the face unlock so can't comment on that.Overall, would suggest that if you want to couple the brand trust along with good features - definitely go for M31 !\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I being looking out for a monster like this for some time now....What I liked about the Phone1. Aesthetic body is sturdy with simple design which gives business  look to phone2. Camera 64 MP lens is quite awesome captures it without being pixellating and various features to choose from3. AMOLED screen in this price is stunning4. Touch is smooth5. Color sharpeness and quality is video as good as high end phone6. Space of 6GB +128 GB is sufficient and has minimum preloaded apps7. Voice clarity is good use good earphone but better sound effect and clarity.Overall u won't find a Made in India product with such a terrific features at competitive  prices..This mobiles seems to be beginning of Aatmanirbhar mission\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Amazon made delivery early than expected.Phone has great screen, no ads experience, in hand feel. Decent cameras, fingerprint speed and access.Most pathetic thing about phone is battery life as well as charging speed. With normal usage it at max sustains 10hrs only including few hours of standby there. It takes 2.30hrs for full charge which is very frustrating. On nail on wounds is its charging cable roughly handful of length (approx hardly 50cms). So frustrating you can't even use phone sitting on sofa while charging.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have received my phone on 25 june after 12 days charging point is not working i called customer care they told me ma'am we ll replace the mobile when i was checking tjis product is out of stock so again i called customer care they told me ma'am we can't replace ur phone as per policy..we only take replacement within 10 days..its just 20 days passed when i  receive this phone.. Amazon delivered me defensive product which is not work more then 20 days now they are making excuses.. please dont  buy any product from Amazon especially expensive product ..\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I bought the phone for the sole purpose of processing power and camera. Processing power is really great and so does the 6000mAh battery. But camera is really disappointing. You expect 64MP AI camera to match the standards but it performs really poor, even worse than my Samsung galaxy A70(2018) with 32MP camera. They should look more closely in building cameras. Phone has lag for some of the heavy apps but it eventually nullify soon you start using it daily. I would say if you are buying this phone for camera then DON'T please\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Taking a screen shot is difficult in this. We need to press the volume button and on/off button to take a screenshot. And the speaker was not good.Rest all like battery life, camera quality, display are all excellent.Battery life is very very awesome.  I can use my phone for almost 24 hours with 70% battery and still can use for the next 2 days.Display was like seeing a dream. Very clear.Camera the one which I really really liked the most. Very good at  vedios,  photos in night are truly awesome,  it has more options.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Amazing crystal clear display and smooth operation.

Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  3 months into using this. Looked like a great phone until now. The phone suddenly started auto - restarting in every 5 minutes in endless loop. Once in a while it switches on, but in not more than 10 minutes, it starts restarting again and stucks on the logo screen (like the image I have attached)I checked online and this is a manufacturing defect in most of M series phone. I'm running rounds in service centres to get it corrected and they're giving me different reasons to deny my warranty. Just after 3 months, you have trash bar in your hand.

Amazing battery. Although charging speed is slow, but once it charges, it does not doe easily. In this lockdown, while i am almost every hour on phone, it still gives me 1-1.25 days of backup which is amazing. Once the lockdown ends, i might get more than 2 days on medium usage. On heavy usage, i am easily getting 1.25 days of battery with SOT of more than 10 hours.Amazing camera and amazing one ui.

Since we are not going for chinese mobiles, this is the only reputed brand we are left with. Disappointed.Amazon - No return policy is very bad.

I went for the 8/128 GB variant.

And most of all Ads Free.Phone consCannot log into google account on the very first time, you will spend your entire  first day with debugging like wifi internet won't work and list goes on regardless of the latest software update.Samsung factory apps cannot be deleted and have to change the settings to stop automatically install apps without consent and unnecessary notifications.Processor is slow, so things take a while to function sometimes, even if u have the 6GB ram like YouTube videos  double touch sometimes doesn't work to 10sec rewind or fast forward the video, fingerprint unlock is not competitivelly fast but can live with it and other apps where rarely touch will work on lag. Doesn't come with back case and screen protector .... and screen protector  is a must for gorilla glass 3 and back case is also required , finger marks come very easily  without it.Final verdict , when your first few min of use is spent with so much issues that u cannot do a simple google log in , your excitement is shattered into frustration, even though the rest of the time there is no issues.....Samsung please wake up!!!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Earlier, i bought M30s for my family members and i used the same few months.

Gone through the specification and booked on the release day itself .The over all performance fare better than M30s due to 6 GB RAM.The camera quality is very much better.The battery life is very good.Worth to buy this money\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Good phone I had ever seenReviewed on samsung.comWell, the Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in blue, the first thing I did was put the case that I had already prepared. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to falling asleep playing on my mobile and using it, and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 64GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 64GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Battary Life:I have bought this phone for long battery and good Camera, however this phone disappointed me in both the cases.1.Battary Life: I am using this phone since 11th August 2020 and now it's 15 days.Phones battary got drained in just 04-05 hours of average active screen usage.This performance is worst than 3000 battery.2.Charging : even after 4:30 hrs of charging phone is not fully charged with given adaptor.This is one of the worst phone battery ever seen.I am getting frustrated because of this.II. CAMERA:So called 64mp camera, quality of camera is seems to be like 32mp camera and is not that much good.III.The worst part is, I have recommended this phone & he bought this phone and facing the same problemKindly replace the phone on immediate basis.We don't want to continue  with this kind of phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Hello  everyone  I have purchased samsung M 31 8gb ram 128 gb storage  in Amazon and I have used for 1 week and  I am giving  review m31 excellent  screen touch keypad ,face unlock good working and finger print unlock excellent and as specially battery  6000mah  kept  full charging and I have tested continuasly  on data I got 1 day  and with wifi  and calls 2 days I got battery backup and mainly , one kept in review about heat I want to tell you onething m31 while using data on and listening  songs online  and chatting , video songs  to gether  and then you will get little  bit heat not heavy after seeing review I have checked  and this result I got it ,so frds  m31 RS 18,999 I have exchange my mobile to this I got  PRICE 15,267/- AFTER EXCHANGE MY OLD MOBILE  AND BACK COVER 399/_ STANDARDso frds if u ask me I will suggest this one 8gb ram and 128gb storage with in budget around 15k change, don't  think too much buy and enjoy for 4 to 5 years\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I\\'m writing this review after using the phone for a month, and here\\'s the detailed review of my experience using the phone.• BEST PARTS1) SCREEN: Straight up the most attractive part of the phone. The sAMOLED display is crisp, color accurate and legible even in the hardest of lights. And the Always-On Display is a bliss, with customisable clock faces and even options to place own photos. Since the display is AMOLED, this doesn\\'t cause much battery drain (about 1-2% more drain when keeping it \"Always On\" as compared to off). And the bezels are not noticeable much, and the screen is super smooth. The refresh rate is still 60Hz, but then it\\'s not geared towards gaming. 9/102) BATTERY LIFE: Absolutely unbelievable! The 6000 mAh battery is no joke and it delivers. I use my phone heavily (~10hr screen on time, with video calls, gaming and instagram scrolling) and still the battery lasts me a day and a half. Charging is also good, it takes almost 2.5 hours to get it from ~20% to 100%. 10/103) PERFORMANCE: The 6/64 variant caters to my needs perfectly. There is always more than 2 GB of RAM free, even when there\\'s 4-5 background apps open. Sometimes I minimise my game to respond to a notification, and then forget about it; and when I open it after 6 hours it\\'s still there in the memory. Phenomenal!The processor, now. Before buying the phone, I read a lot of reviews as I was skeptical about the processor. Snapdragon 730G is better, they said. But to be honest, I really don\\'t see the difference. This phone has never once lagged in my one month of using it. It is snappy and DOESN\\'T HEAT UP.  10/104) SOFTWARE: As soon as I started up the phone, I opened up the app drawer and removed all the apps that could be removed, and then disabled some I didn\\'t need and couldn\\'t be uninstalled (Samsung\\'s mostly), so that\\'s GREAT. Also, I ensured I disabled notifications whenever any spammy notifications arrived, and within two days my phone was ABSOLUTELY bloat-free.Samsung\\'s OneUI is beautiful. I have no other words for it. The dark mode goes well with the sAMOLED display, and is absolutely great to work with. I\\'d always been a fan of stock Android and Pixel, but OneUI changed me. 10/105) CAMERA QUALITY: I\\'m not an enthusiastic photographer, but as far as day-to-day photography is concerned, it is magnificent and highly detailed. You need to tweak settings in the Camera app to suit your taste and also set the resolution (64MP photos are 3:4 aspect ratio, but I prefer Full screen, for example). I also got GCam installed and that\\'s added benefit, if you care. The wide angle lens is nice! There\\'s barrell distortion at the edges but you get an option to automatically correct it in the settings. Macro camera is able to pick up details easily and really close to the subject.Front camera is equally good, able to capture details nicely. There\\'s also a wide angle mode for the front camera, though it\\'s just software and there isn\\'t an actual wide angle camera at the front. 9/10 for both!• NOT-SO-GOOD PARTS1) The speaker quality is not breathtaking. It does the job and is reasonably loud, but I prefer headphones or else my Echo Dot for audio, so it doesn\\'t matter.2) The back surface is \"glasstic\" and smudges easily. Get yourself a cover and you\\'re good to go.3) Fingerprint sensor is FAST but use it once with sweaty fingers and it can\\'t detect anymore unless you clean it.So, there you have it. If you want a no-nonsense phone with great battery, screen and camera, with NO ads (read: Xiaomi, Realme) and NO bloatware and a BEAUTIFUL UI, look no further. The Galaxy M31 is THE phone to go for.P.S. call quality and network is also flawless. I use airtel.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)Pros1. Great phone with 128 GB storage and 6 GB RAM at this price.  Definitely great  value for money.2. Total 5 cameras make it a great photography experience. (wide angle + depth + macro for close ups.3. 6000 mAh Battery lasts for more than 24 hr with moderate use. Charging is fast. Takes 2 hr to charge from  20 % to 100%.4. Switch over to USB type C cable which is going to be the future universal cable across all devices of all companies.Cons1. 128 GB memory is great but within a month it has started getting reduced with software updates. It is the same game that the mobile companies have been playing with the customers. One has to discard the phone while it is still working well because of depleting memory. Let me see how long I am able to use this phone despite my settings  to store most of the things in the SD card.2. Highest sound volume is also very unsatisfactory. In fact, the worst sound volume among all phones that I have used earlier including three different models of Samsung Galaxy.3. The positioning of cameras on margin is problematic because we are used to camera lenses positioned around the mid-line of devices. It is difficult to aim the camera with a side-aligned Macro lens.4. Default Font type and size is very small. Option of Samsung Font is provided and it has better readability.  But even after switching to Samsung font and increasing the font size through display settings it works on some websites but not on many others where the font remains small.5. The phone heats up while charging . I never experienced this heating while charging with any of my earlier Samsung phones..6. The charger has a USB Type C cable. Therefore, you have to make sure that you carry your new cable with you all the time on the go till it becomes the normal charging cable like the present Type B cables found in each home and office.7. Very difficult to take screenshots with M31 because the volume control and the on-off switch are on the same side adjacent to each other.8. Samsung has saved some money by not including  ear phones in the phone package.  Earphone  doesn't cost much but a new earphone with a new phone gives good feeling to customers. This was not expected from the cell phone giant like Samsung.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Seller must be banned... I ordered this handset twice.... First time it was ON inside the package.... I returned the parcel that time..... Then ordered again.... Today after opening the handset everything was looking good, but when open Sim slot it was very tight from inside.... When it ejected finally, the Sim slot was tampered... I think it's returned and repackaged handset sold by the seller.... So the seller must be kicked out from Amazon Prime...\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Its battery life is really amazing. I charged this phone from 0 to 100 in 160 mins. If you are heavy social media user you can use continously 10hrs with one full charge.Pros:Good wide angle cameraBest selfieGreat features like app timer and you can see how much you spended time in each day.It can be suitable fir even 13 years child too with parental control.Good display qualityFast responding with no hangsAll rounder.It owned its samsung exynos 9116 soc processer. Which prevent from loss of performance when heatingCons:Dust on phone will easily visibleDesign is lightly oldSamsung still remains the launcher no improvement in launcher.Charging time is little slow when compared to redmi latest phones\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Overall Good. 6GB RAM provides smooth operating of Phone along with Android 10 and One UI 2.0. Though fast charging feature is provided in this model, feels like its charging at normal speed and samsung needs to check with this. As I also own a Samsung galaxy M40 whose charging is really fast as compared to M31.Only drawback is that can't get proper sized tempered glass for this mobile. Hope Samsung will try to provide Proper accessories for any new Model they launch.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Great phone in all aspects at a pocket friendly price point. i was using several expensive brands earlier and i needed another phone for some generic use at home. i was looking for a good balance of quality, brand, performance and a decent price point. this samsung galaxy M31 fits that bill perfectly. i have been using this for several months now and i am extremely happy with it's performance. speed and responsiveness are great. camera quality is comparable to several expensive phones that i have at home. finger print sensor is a great relief and makes it highly usable. display quality, like all samsung devices is really superior. light weight on the pocket both in terms of it's real weight and also from the price perspective :-) Strongly recommend to budget conscious folks..\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Phone built quality is good. It's a very rigid phone. I have already dropped it thrice but thank God phone is working normal till now.Camera quality is AWESOME. It is best in this price range. But camera is not so quick. Phone gives lag while using camera.Battery life is normal if we see a 6000 MAh battery. My usage is mostly internet and I use Bluetooth connection also. I get around 8 to 10 hours of battery life when Bluetooth and location is on.Finger print sensor is working fine. But I think it could be a faster one.Phone is not so quick while using multiple windows. It gives lag.Overall I am fully satisfied with the phone performance. Highly recommended if you are searching a new phone in this price range. GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHT.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Best Mobile from Samsung I Purchased 2 handset from Amazon, In Just Rs:17499/ You get A Samsung Mobile with 128 GB of Internal Storage, 6GB RAM & 6.4 Inch Super Amoled Screen.Best part of it Mega Moster 6000 Mah Battery first from any Mobile Co.You can buy this Mobile without second thaught. I m enjoying 3 day of Battery life on moderate use.Thank Brand Samsung n Amazon quickly delivered to me within 12 hours.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I've got the 6GB+128GB variant and thanks to early access and Prime Delivery experience....Pro:1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.7. Price.Cons:1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protection🙂.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  with plenty of very good and expert reviews available for Samsung M31 for its deserving features and quality, I would like to share my experience as a user with vision impairment using screen-reader and Text-to-speech:1. Samsung mM31 features Samsung's own built-in screen reader 'voice assistant', hence Android Accessibility Suite doesn't come built-in. One needs to download it from playstore if the need be.2. Samsung's 'Voice Assistant' is an efficient screen-reader in itself, but those used to Talkback will find it less suitable in terms of gestures and other features.3. The camera is surprisingly accessible with the screen-reader telling you if face(s) get focused. I could click not-so-bad pictures as a totally blind person!4. Samsung's UI and in-built applications offer smooth and faster navigation while using screen-reader. Most of the buttons in Samsung's apps are labeled and hence accessible.5. Attending calls is most convenient with the volume-up button doing the job. Live caption is also another fantastic feature that will be useful for the hearing impaired people.6. There could have been an option to wake the Google Assistant using power button since 'Okay Google' comment is not all that convenient in travel and noisy places.Overall, Samsung M31 is a very good choice in this budget for the visually impaired / blind users too.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Pretty heavy phone to handle.great response time from one window to another, excellent refresh rate on the screen.Didn’t like was too much heating on the phone. May becoz of the 6000 mah battery at the back but it’s ok as most of phone do heat up.Battery life is something on how the person uses it, it’s recommended that use the phone till it indicates it needs to be charged say 15% or even 5%. And then charge the phone back again. To have healthy battery life.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  On the next day of release i.e 6.3.2020 ,  I purchased Samsung M31 , as I was very impressed with M20.Samsung the \" master in creating mobiles \" in the intrest of public and to their taste.  My order was honoured and sent the phone within 3days.Now Iam enjoying the great phone suitable to my purse.No heating in playing and recording videos.Thrillig sound output ..What more I need..I recommend to my friends to own a beautiful phone..\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Review after 4 months of regular usage. The product is really awesome.Pros:Awesome display. Best in its class. Color quality really awesome with good brightness.Awesome battery. Easily lasts for 2 days.Awesome camera. The images captured are having enhanced colors that are very attractive. Better result in low light compared to my other 22k phone. Memory management, even high resolution images are of ambient size. Front camera result is really awesome.Processor. Its good and I did not find any lag since I bought the phone.Weight management and balanced body.Conc.Notch display and back mounted fingerprint scanner. Other phones come with punch hole display and in-screen or side mounted scanner. But the price is higher and also in many display is ips lcd and not super amoled. So its the preference by which you should decide.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  First of all I received the phone I was incredibly happyIt says it has 6000amper but I found it was not up to the expectationsIt takes around 3:30 hr to charge completely while it should only take approx 2:30 hr,even battery drains out quickly within 8-9hours on WiFi the battery turns from 100% to 17%-this is how 6000mah works????? ofcourse not!!!!It heats up a lot while charging like about to burstFor me it was a terrible experience ,I will not recommend anyone to purchase Samsung m31 , Samsung is a brilliant industry which makes brilliant and durable products but its only applicable to their high rated phones(above 60000rs)In the case of m31 they have too many compromises which reduces the battery efficiency,camera quality and all and you not need to waste even 17499rs for that you can get these lower performance even in the budget😉 of 6000rs,for me it's a high rated product with low I mean very low performanceBetter to by any other brand products in place of using this phone by Samsung!!!!!!!Anyways Samsung is the brilliant company but here they are making compromises in low priced productsSo same your time and money both,😁😁😁😁What's inside the box-adaptor with able,phone,warranty papers,pin and that's it😵😂And now I don't want the product coz for me even 17499rs matters alot\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  1. I'm writing this review after 120 days of usage, using the 6GB Ram /128GB version.2. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon - within 72hr delivery.(b) The phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(c) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(d) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo, realms and Mi. Works like a flash.(e) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(f) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. Front camera is average.(g) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(h) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking approx 3hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.(c) Finger touch has less sensitivity.5. Otherwise I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Camera is awesome, you just need to know how to use it in the best way.Fingerprint, face unlock are pretty fast.Battery lasts for 1.5 days for person like me who listens to music, plays games but less often, talks over skype and click photos every now and then.I love this phone and I appreciate myself for choosing it over realme 6 and other such Chinese phones.Good job Samsung 💯🤟\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Very best product at this range. Battery and camera is awesome. Network connectivity is not as strong as M30 but it could be better with some updates. Design and build is awesome and also glass is strong I dropped 3 4 times but its totally fine. I would recommend to provide some updates for network stability rest everything is awesome.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Previously, I was using Samsung A6+ which accidentally got broken so needed one phone too as I can't get it to repair as it was during the lockdown. So, I was looking to buy this phone looking at its features, and after hearing that it will even be available in 8gb RAM and also its price. But, when I checked this phone on Amazon and Samsung website firstly it was not on stock. So, then I waited for a few days to get it. Later on, as soon as it was on stock I purchased it, and also it was my first experience to purchase a smartphone online. I received it on time and it's just a perfect phone as per my usage. I would also prefer it to everyone who wants a smartphone with good storage capacity, battery, camera, and performance then it is definitely the one.Thank you Amazon for timely and undamaged delivery and also for making it available during lockdown too.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  What I like about the phone is that the touch is smooth, the back camera is good but i honestly expected better considering that is its usp. The 2nd day of using the phone my instagram stopped working and was force closing every single time and the whole phone would freeze and not work for 30secs. The battery life is surprisingly not good. It takes a long time to charge since its 6000 mah battery but drains completely in a day. The face unlock is not that fast. The camera is noisy at night and the wide angle sides gets distorted. Even the front camera is not that good at low light. Also absolutely hate that Samsung has so many pre installed app which cluster the phone and is of absolute no use.Overall an okay phone, for me i expected better at 17k.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  First of all after 1 month of using m31, i am now going to post a review about it.. so let's start with the followingScreen-first of all if you are a movie lover or watch movies mostly on mobile then its samoled has no comparison and is best in all cotegories.Battery- optimization of battery is not so good, but yeah you can play pubg continuous for almost 7-8 hrs which is quite impressive.. now you can think of urself how good is its batteryProcessor-its processor is quite good, but but but optimization of it is worst, 9611 is quite gud, if it may be optimized well..with the software and games..You can get fps around 35-55 in pubg smooth +extremeBody-body is made of plastic, and no frame but yaa with a cover it look amazing🖤Weight- with a massive 6000mah battery weight of the phone is well managed not so heavy, not so light, normal normal but yaa more than normal devicesLast but not the leastAdvice-download Package disabler pro and disable all bloatware.. it will make your device more smooth...I guess in the next update they will optimize the processor and fix there services bugs..Stay safe❤\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Nice phone with almost all advanced features.Pros:-1. Display is FHD and full marks to it.2. Sound quality is ok.3. Android 10 is handy.4. Full marks ro 64MP quad camera.Cons:-1. Battery is never felt like 6000mah. Rather it performs like 4500mah.2.while receiving the call the panel sensitivity is poor.Overall value for money. Must buy.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Pointwise Review after 15 day usage:Buid quality: Basic build quality with plastic uni-body, not that impressive but not that bad. Looks just fine. Back panel attracts lots of finger impressions.Screen: must be the best displays that samsung is providing in M series within this price range or comparable to even flagships.Rear camera: it has 4 rear camera sensors, here is what i felt about these:-Main 64MP sensor: probably the best in this price range, performs phenomenonal in day light conditions. However, in low light conditions you start to feel that it's a lower mid rnge phone, though all phone in this price segment struggle in low light conditions.Macro sensor: it fine, not bad. However, i had more expections with it.Wide angle sensor: pathetic qualityDepth sensor: must be the worst, very poor edge detection.Front camera: inclined towards good camera category, it can be improved.Processor: no problem in normal usage, but not recommended for those who want to play heavy games on it.Ram management: initially more than 3gb memory was always in use without software or even sim. But after tweeking the optimization settings and removing bloatware, it performing better. No complaintMemory: it's fast, no complaintBattery: it's really a monster. With normal usage of calling, camera, messaging you can easily get 2 days of battery life. It can be easily extended to even 4 days if you use very less.Charging: Though samsung claims fast charging, it's not. 15W charger doesnt seems to be really providing 15W power. Theoretically, it should charge 6000mAh battery in 2 hours, but it takes 3-3.5 hours for full charging. Not that impressive.Speaker output: it's fine, not that laud but not that low.Sound quality in earphones: Good quality output, no complaintFingerprint and face unlock: no complaintCons:1. Slow charging speed2. Very poor wide angle camera3. Poor edge detection in depth camera sensor4. One serious problem that others also faced: randomly 2 times it got rebooted itself and stuck on boot screen for 20 minutes. I have to see if it persists.Edit: after july OTA update battery performance reduced significantly.Edit: after 1.5month of usage; working fine. Rebooting problem didnt happen again after OTA update. Battery performance was better before the update. However, still it's not bad. One need to tweek app settings to optimise the juice suckling of the apps.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Awesome device. The One ui is filled with lot of features .The camera and battery 6k mah is best.Camera quality is sharp with better detailing,good dynamic range.Must buy it.Selfie camera Sensor sony (imx616) is great.The 5mp macro shots are better.Built quality is better than m30s.The camera is far far better than any other brand phone in this price.But the back side can be easily  scratched so its better to use a case or vinyl.Battery lasts approx  2 days without using internet.

The 64 MP camera captures stunning  photos during day however you cannot zoom in 64 MP during capture. The camera quality is really awesome. Super Amoled screen is good and the quality is really amazing , it's  screen doesn't feel like you are looking at a screen. It feels like it's  a picture and your eyes never tired of it like it used to be in LCD screen. The fast charger provided is fast enough and charges at 1% per min. The huge 6000Mah battery is really Monster and last for 2 days for a normal user.

Only thing is is bad and disturbing in it is its charging speed ie so slow afterall having with 15 watt of its original charger it use to take like 3.5-4 hours to get fully charge seriously disgusting but hopefully its other features backlash that ........

Phone is working pretty ok since then except the battery unit in it. The battery efficiency has fallen since then.Had the problem not happened, this phone deserved a generous 5 star. 👍Update as on June 2, 2020:-Pretty satisfied with its performance. Very dependable phone. The display quality is top notch. Camera is awesome. Hands-on feel of the phone is pretty premium at this price point. File transfers are smooth across other devices. I am very much satisfied with this Samsung unit especially when it faced such an issue before. What more to go well down with such an awesome device alongwith a super prompt customer service.Must go for this!!👍 RECOMMEND.. RECOMMEND..

Amazon 👍\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Review after 40days of use. My purpose is calls, watsapp, mails, YouTube, light gaming, browsing, gps maps, App financial transactions. With 6gb ram, this mobile dose all job smoothly.6000mah battery is really good offer. Earlier 'Battery backup' was a big issue for me due to continuous travel for my sales job.  Now, I can happily use GPS maps with worring about battery drain issue during work hrs.This is worth a buy. I charge daily night, but my observation (not tested) says, battery definitely last 1&half day with normal use.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Last 4 years, i was using  Samsung galaxy on next, when I seen Samsung galaxy m31 launched on Amazon, I seen all feature m31, I really socked  64 miga pixel camera, 6000 MH battery, 6GB Ram, 64 memory, it unbelievable price only ( 14,999/-), I really liked this phone camera quality & battery backup, also phone running very fast, phone color and design very cool, thanks Amazon. 🙂😃\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This phone is OK but not as good that you guys are thinking about its specifications, camera is not even average but OK for those who don't know what is a photo look like now a days, according to build quality and size phone is good in handling but you need a good quality cover and a screen protector otherwise quality is worst, I can't even compare this phone to any mid range phone that is the only quality this phone have 😒, and secondly people thinking about its android version that's really funny most of the phones in the market coming with same kind of android version so better wait and let another phone to come out, I am not saying don't buy it but for me wait if you don't need a phone right now.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Ok ok product...I don't know how people are giving so much rating for this product...My review post 2 weeks of usage:Pros:Budget friendlyNice camera with nice features.especially wide angle and slow motion.Nice amoled display.Battery is also ok.Cons:front camera adding so many filters which I dont like...missing the natural picture die to these filters.camera specs dient match the quality of pictures.Battery is taking around 3 hours from 0 to 100 which is too much time.at the same time draining in 1 and half days of modern usage.Face lock is not smooth sometimes responding bit slow.Very low sound comparative my any previous models whether its samsung series or redmi series.Mobile also doesn't works seamlessly.taking 1 or 2 secs to open the app some times.Finally so so product.and could be I expected too much from the config they mentioned abt.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  In this phone everything specifications are described in the detail section.  But the actual thing is we should  buy or not. Then I am telling you my experience with this phone.In daily usases this phone is absolutely fine in this price segment. Only one thing is that you can play PUBG on recommended settings  not on the high settings for long time. Otherwise there is no any issue in this phone. Only one thing I want to say that this phone is the best.Love it. Display is absolutely fine.Go for it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I am using Samsung phone first time in my life. I was generally using Mi phones in past. But this time. But this time I want to experience Samsung phone & I found Amazing Phone Samsung Galaxy M31 phone as compared to all Mi brand phones. I am excited with following reasons to use this phone:- 6000 mah battery, for 2 days not need to charge even using for games and zoom meeting- 4 rear camara. I got amazing results even in Night also. Front camera results was also amazing.- 6GB RAM. So phone is not hang even so many applications are running on background.- 128 GB ROM. Not need to use memory card.- Space black colour. Amazing sexy looking- Function of taking selfy using our hand palm.- Font is also good.- Brightness is great even in sun light.- Bluelight filter can help to reduce stress of eyes to use phone in nightI strongly recommend to buy this phone.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  After using one month ..These are good things I noticed..1. touch is good 2. Battery is good.. 3.screen is perfect .  Now comes to bad points..1.some time screen got blackout automatically not expected this.. 2. in simple application it get hang some time(i am not pubg player dont know what they are racing).  3. Camera is okk okk i hv vivo with same specifications ..As it is camera phone still it lags with vivo...\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Speed of mobile is Good, no hanging, smooth gaming. For me Camera not up to the mark...as I earlier used Samsung note5 and 8mp of note5 is much better then this 64mp. Samoled is great. Finishing of the product is so not good....alignment of fitting lacks perfection. Camera holes alignment or side edge you can see poor craftsmanship.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I felt myself very bad for switching  back to Samsung. It is having all good quality as they mention in specifications. But I can't imagine  why it is generating that much of heat at upper half part of mobile. Very scary even to touch. Hope it will be solved in future with some system upgradation. Waiting for the same- Charan\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  OCEAN BLUE, 6+128The product was delivered to me on 8th March 2020,so i am reviewing it after 3 months.1. Camera QualityThe quad camera is awesome, even some shots can be compared from cinematic shots you can zoom the pic upto extreme extend.Front camera is 32MP and selfies are as good as the pics taken from rear camera Sometimes even better.Overall camera is excellent .2. DISPLAYWith the phone equipped with superamoled along with infinity display you can watch some videos on YouTube even on 240p and it gives the feel of 360p quality.Needless to say about HD video their views are crystal clear.Although the display is protected by Coring Gorilla 3 but i would suggest the buyers to apply screengaurd the quality of videos or the touchscreen functions would not be affected i can assure you for that.3. BATTERY LIFEThe most demanding feature in any cellphone.For normal usage like movies, calls, videos calls, music the battery would lasts upto almost 2days.On the otherhand if you are a heavy gamer like PUBG or CALL OF DUTY, then also you can play these games 8-10hours continuously.I have played PUBG on M31 8 hours continuously with 15% battery remaining afterwards.4. GAMEPLAYPUBG never lagsWhenever i am playing with my squad they say the game is lagging as some squad or any enemy is approaching but i never ever experienced any type of lagging during gameplay except the network error problem or sometimes when internet is not  working properly.Otherwise, if you are a pro player of PUBG you can reach CONQUERER rank with this phone.5. RAM & ROMThe buyer will get almost 110gb of user space as their some pre-installed and system apps.With 6gb RAM you are all set for smooth and fast gameplay and multifunction.6. FINGERPRINT READERYou can add more than one fingerprint.Beside that the sensor is at the back side so at times you can feel that the sensor should have been on screen otherwise the sensor responds quickly to the fingerprint.Overall it's best phone in the market below 20000.The only missing quality was 8gb ram according to my opinion but on 29th May 2020 8gb RAM variant was also been launched.The one and only drawback with this cellphone is its charging time as the battery capacity is 6000mAh but the charger is of 15W only so it takes 3hours to charge the battery 100%.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it\\'s M series of smartphones.Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.Rating: 5 of 5.Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.Rating: 5 of 5Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it\\'s awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that\\'s normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it\\'s ok at this price point.Rating: 5 of 5Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.Sound: 4 of 5Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can\\'t be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.Rating: 4 of 5.Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word \"Excellent\". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.Rating: 5 of 5Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.Rating: 5/5Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  *Looks_Premium*Samsung has gone with glasstic for the back of the phone — plastic that looks and feels like glass — which is smart, because it gives the phone a premium finish while keeping the weight low. And weight could have been a problem given that Samsung shoved a monster 6,000 mAh battery into this thing.And don\\'t let the \"glass\" in “glasstic” fool you, it’s still plastic and still prone to scratches, and it’s glossy, making the phone slippery to hold, especially for someone as butterfingered as I am. On the bright side, the phone doesn’t look cheap, unlike its predecessor.Battery Life- An Absolute BeastPacking a whopping 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M31 has managed to reach roughly the end of two days on a single charge, despite being connected to Wi-Fi for the majority of that time, with Bluetooth on and multiple wearables and a pair of wireless earbuds connected for good measure. That’s on top of the heavy use activities I mentioned previously. Simply put, you’d have to be a serious procrastinator to even think about draining the battery completely in a single day.Samsung Galaxy M31 – 4The Galaxy M31 proves that having a multi-day battery life doesn’t cost the Earth, and if you were planning on using the M31 as your main media device of choice, this unbelievable battery life paired with the phone’s AMOLED screen makes for a match-made in heaven. You could binge content for hours on this thing.The only letdown is the supposed inclusion of 15w fast charging, which I beg to differ. When hooked up to a power outlet, it took just over two hours to reach full charge from 8%. If charging your phone overnight is part of your routine then you’ll never have an issue here, but needing a quick top up before you leave your home is just out of the question.Camera Quality- Good but not BestGood quad rear camera setup - 64MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensorShots taken with the primary camera during daylight are quite satisfactory, images are detailed, especially the 64MP shots, and they showcase good dynamic rangeThe ultra-wide sensor, like on any budget phone, is a good addition - it takes social media-worthy images in great lighting conditions (in low-light, the quality dips and pictures look grainy and noisy, wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges)Photos taken in low-light looks good - switching to Night mode helps reduce grain in the output and further improves image qualityLive Focus shots are quite impeccable and the camera app does give you the option to set the level of blur before taking a shot - edge detection is very good and the Galaxy M31 does a good job of separating the subject from the backgroundThe macro camera takes decent shots outdoors (though, the quality dips when indoors and the output is restricted to 5MP in resolution)The 32MP selfie camera is quite good and takes detailed selfies (though, in low light, the quality goes down a notch and results are grainy)Overall, the cameras on the M31 are good for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title crowned to the POCO X2)Overall Verdict:Samsung\\'s Galaxy M31 delivers the promise of long-lasting battery life and one of the best in its class in the market. In the camera department too has improved a lot over the predecessor.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Got this after my long stint with the Lenovo Zuk Z2 plus. Jumping from a Snapdragon (820) to an Exynos was difficult, but had no other choice. After a lot of searches and collating data and feedbacks, went for the Galaxy M31 (6+128). Was planning for an 8gb model but was not sure how good Exynos 9611 would handle tasks, so went with one level down. To be honest this phone does the job very good and more than what is expected. Back is a finer print magnet and the open camera is prone to damage unless a good back cover is put on. App loading time is a bit high. Fingerprint and face unlock is fast though the face unlock takes a longer time sometimes. I tested face unlock in dark environment and worked good as the brightness fills up your face from the device to capture the face. Similarly works for night time low light selfies. Games run smooth with minor frame drops at high settings otherwise you wouldn't find any (I am not a gamer though tried quite a few for sometime off in the lockdown). Has a specific game booster mode. There's no lag on the phone unless you install multiple apps as in my case. I have a usage of lot of apps at all times on my phone (32 as of now including the preinstalled ones). You'd only find lags while opening the app drawer beacause the phone is unable to handle so many apps installed. If you are not into keeping many apps on your device this is the perfect phone for you. Camera quality is good. Has a night mode which captures good pictures in low light. But selfies in low light are not good. This phone did not disappoint me (only if I have lesser apps). Preinstalled apps are removable. Battery backup is very good and with a fast charger is power packed. Faster fast charger would have been more helpful for this battery though. Liked it but would be happier only Samsung could have shortened or removed the notch with a punch hole as in the M31s. Samsung does not provide SD processor and Amoled screen together and they have been running the same old 9611 processor of theirs on all recent (previous ) and new phones as well from the A & M series. It's time Samsung thinks about it. Just not to increase the price of a phone with few new features and same old processor won't do good. Overall a good phone to go for. A tough competitor with other Chinese counterparts. You can also checkout the M21 which only has a difference of camera (48mp) if you want to save some bucks. Other features mostly remain the same.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Its finger print reader is really quick.. i dont need any faster finger print reader than this one.. battery life is really awesome.. and camera is one of the finest among smartphones..I am submiting the review after a month's usage... I bought this mobile just for 12.5k.. exchanging the old one.. The only thing i felt was.. we have to use a good back cover for this device.. and so the phone becomes heavier when compared to most of the other mobiles.. but the features it provides are awesome..  The always on screen and camera features are the two things.. which I liked the most in this device..\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I this product 4 days ago and camera stopped working. Bought this product because Samsung is a trusted company and this product had a really good reviews but after 3 days of use camera shows 'warning: camera failed' I cannot use my camera on camera on WhatsApp for anything. Customer care was also not helpful and I cannot even download Samsung members app on this phone I don't know where to seek help from.WHAT IS THIS BEHAVIOUR SAMSUNG?\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Worst phone ever, this is how companies make indian people stupid... although I am also .. feeling cheated...1)back cover is pathetic easily got scratched and marked. 2)Updates are mandatory and everytime you do phone becomes slower even if you free 75% of memory.3) play games and it get heated.4) ghatiya user interface.5) speakers are best part of cheating happened with buyer.6) front camera is fake and it always shows beauty plus type pic.7) over valued phone.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Fingerprint reader works quite well but not so amazing as my old redmi note4 because it only works if your finger is completely moisture and dust free. Camera quality is amazing, works well even in low light. Even though I expected a little bit more battery life (I am using always on screen and maximum cpu usage) it is pretty good. Screen quality is good and I have to say that even for an above average hand sized person like me, it is difficult to use this handset in a single hand (you cannot access the notification bar while using a single hand). The lenght of the phone is a bit over sized i guess. Talking about other physical attributes, it is a bit over weighted because of the 6000mAh monster of a battery it is packing. There are a lot more advanced features encorporated in this handset and most of them are very much user friendly.  I have been using this phone for 2 months now and honestly speaking I have encountered hanging 2 times. But both of the times it was the application that wasn't resposding. First time I had tried to close the application and it took some time to respond to it. I know its a bit harsh to criticize such a phone that provides so much for a budget price but I thought it would be better to give an honest experience here because for buyers like me every penny is hard earned!Thanks.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This mobile phone is amazing in photography and its battery also good and fingerprint sensor works better than you expect but some time your hand wet and dirty it not perfectly works...I am using from the launch of this mobile I want to suggest you plzz make splash proof phone in mid range.I remember 10th June my phone was wet in slowly rain in only 1 or 2 minutes and this accident reactions on 24th July in morning 5 or 6 AM my display is covering black liquid like cloud. I am going to pay 7-8 thousand for display repairing.... I am unsatisfied to display plzz make splash proof phone in midrange smartphones.Thank You\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have been loyal Samsung user for years now. This one works smooth but trying to get used to its screen length. Camera works fine. I haven't noticed any difference between normal cam mode and 64mp mode, but both are fine. Macro lens version is to be simply admired. Slow motion works well too. Overall it's a good phone. I am satisfied.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  As Again Samsung Totally Proven Me Wrong. I had used Samsung J Series Smartphone for approx 3-4 months because of it lacking problem I switched to other brand now back I am using this smartphone m31 its almost a month old and atleast once a day it's got hang. The camera is so poor full on artificial colours can be seen from front and rear as well.  The Smartphone is totally a waste of money in this range.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Writing this review after using it for 3 months now. Overall a great buy in this price range, i purchased 64GB model for rs 15999. Amazingly fast touch, display is really good with true colors, slim & light phone, good shape easy to have a good grip, battery pife is amazing lasts almost for 2 days even if i decently use it, really fast charging, camera is not very good if you conpare it to other phones like redmi or oppo of this range,night vision camera is almost of no use, still camera is ok ok, fingureprint sensor not very fast and good but works fine, good speaker sound, fast operating .\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Quality and a class product with many new and advance features. As I got this product on 15th Aug, I experienced the accuracy of Battery life  with 6000 mah. But I can adjudge the quality of battery and it's durability after use of some more days. Till now I am fully satisfied with the product. I can advise whosoever is reading my review may decide this phone m31 without any confusion as this is latest with quality display, voice with advance features.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Nothing much to say about disliking,Because I love this phone,Camera quality is best,Battery life was my preferred thing to look for and so now I dont have to worry about it after buying this phone.Finger print reader is working best, as previously I used some other phones whose finger print reader did suck after using for a month, but Samsung so far has done a wonderful quality built.I am happy and I know it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  6 MONTH REVIEW:I came to this phone after using the S7 for 3 years and finally decided to move on to a bigger screen and also the battery on the S7 had seriously degraded to a point where I had to recharge it twice a day.So one of my major draw for this phone was the 6000 mAh battery sadly that was the most disappointing part of the phone. The phone was advertised as having a 2 day battery but with my primary usage of watching videos it hardly lasts an entire day.It does last 2 days on light usage though which comes handy when traveling. I have disabled fast charging to allow my battery to last longer but even in cable charging mode the phone charges quite fast which is good.It also used to hang and restart abruptly quite often initially but after multiple updates it seems to have stabilized.The fingerprint reader requires multiple tries to work as it seems to attract smudges which inhibit it's performance.The Camera was one of the prime reasons to buy the phone and it's perhaps the best feature of this device. I usually use the 64mp feature for highest quality which it delivers.Overall for the price the phone is alright but hopefully Samsung can improve the battery life through some future updates.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Only within 3 to 4 days I came know that mobile is over heating during normal video conferencing. I urges Amazon to take it back and give refund but they refused. They scheduled an appointment for mobile check. no one came to check the mobile as scheduled before.  The rescheduling was done 3 times but all times no one came. I am so frustrated not only by poor quality of samsung phone but also the poor service by AMAZON. I urge everyone to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PARTICULAR SAMSUNG MOBILE MODEL and STAY AWAY FROM AMAZON AS WELL DUE TO THEIR EXTREME POOR SERVICE.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The phone doesn't work nothing like it has a 6GB RAM. It lags sometimes at the simplest of places.It works. Most of the time.Finger print reader doesn't respond sometimes.Not recommended for heavy users.Tech specs aren't everything.The curved screen is a headache if you want to use it with a single hand because the palm touches something else on the screen.Can buy for retired parents but not working people.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is my 5th samsung phone and following are the pros and cons for this product.Pros:-Build quality:-2.5/5 yeah most of it is polycarbonate which feels little lighter on side but it is better than glass back for those who use phone roughly it eliminates the rust of breaking.Style:- 5/5 yeah it's samsung👍Performance:- 4/5 yeah it is a monster 👍Camera:-5/5 superb it is,👍Battery:-5/5 two days on the go👍Display:-5/5 i love samsung s-amoled👍👍Fingerprint sensor:- 5/5 lightining fastFace unlock:- 5/5 lightining fastCONS-polycarbonate looks like plastic.Processor is little dizzy for hardcore gamersPhysical Fingerprint sensor is a bit outdated now a days.Polycarbonate back is plain and fingerprint magnet.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Samsung should seriously consider in providing secure folder feature to this phone through a software update. Rest, the phone is fluid and a delight to behold. The screen display is awesome and for day to day function is worth the buck. Best part: Made in India and a good ambassador of quality of manufactured in India product.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Worthy points of its cost:1) Gorgeous Display - No company provides sAmoled at this point of cost.2) Battery - 6000mah? Yes it is. I don't have to say anything about it.3) Camera - 64mp and 32mp sensors perform well in good lighting conditions.4) UI - Best UI after oxygen UI. It has all the suffosticated requirements for a normal user.5) Software updates - The company has promised  2 to 3 years of software update. That's a good.Unworthy points of its cost:1) Plastic built - Really? For 16K? Come on samsung.2) GG3 - Atleast we can say it has protection. But in reality I don't think so.3) 15w charging - The company claims this is fast charging.  Really? Then what do you say about 30w, 55w,65w and 120w charging... is it slow charging?4) 9611 - Well well... look who is here... the same old guy from past century...  Gamers.. beware of this old guy...  if you ever heard 9611 stay 10 feet away. I bet you will get better phone than this.On conclusion. For samsung lovers this phone is best but for normal users... I bet u will have better options on market.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  \\xa0Touchscreen defective. Product is not working.  I have applied for replacement. But amazon associate said I have to wait for 5 days for the replacement.Yesterday amazon service engineer visited & inspected the product. But today the delivery boy rejected the replacement showing imei no not generated from phone. The phone replaced due to touchscreen problem,  how imei no can generate from touchscreen?  I am a prime member of amazon. I am deciding to cancel my prime membership.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) is an average low mid range product for a reasonable price. It is as fast as my Galaxy S7, but not as fast as S20. Please don't buy this phone expecting to be flagship Galaxy S20. You get what you pay for. No complains so far.The Good:1) Finger Print Reader is good - unlocks in 1 to 1.5 seconds2) Battery Life is good - 1.5 days of usableThe Average:1) Camera is average, please don't expect it to deliver S20 Quality Pictures, remember, you have paid 1/3 of S20 price.The Ugly:1) Bloatware from Google & Samsung\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Phone is earlier get some hang issue but its bit lessen after a software update recently..Still Signal Problem is there....No Auto Focus feature in camera...Battery is excellent...photo & video quality is average... Processor is also average...Screen is very good...dark night photo is not so good... Front flash is also not there...back cover should be glass type gorilla protection....\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  i am writing this review after a week of usage.Camera quality, screen size,  is good and battery charging is fast comparatively.Battery life is good but best as per the ads and promos given by Samsung even though it says 6000mah couldn't find any big difference than other 4030mah phones.Cons: simple things like App lock, auto brightness and front screen sensor  (instead they are using the front camera itself for sensing but the performance is poor in that aspect ) ,favorite settings in contacts etc are not there which is considered basic for any smart phone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  First of all, this is a china-free smartphone. Samsung produces no smartphone in above mentioned country.This piece is a value for money product. I am experiencing a monstrous battery life with decent super amoled display.You will definitively observe a mind boggling viewing experience.Blue light effect is quite helpful for eyes. And its outstanding camera quality will impress you to the brim.Last but not least, Brand Value, Samsung always has a reasonable resale value.Cons:Speaker output is low. If you are a type of person who doesn't like earphones, and loves to hear songs on speaker, this product might not impress you.Exynos 9611, though is a decent processor equivalent to Snapdragon 712, but is unsuitable for hardcore gamers. In low graphics, you can observe playable fps.Charging time is approximately 180-190 minutes from 0-100. Fast charging needs improvement.Samsung could have provided an earphone, unfortunately, there's none.Summary:This is a value for money smartphone which focus is to grab attention of movies and TV show audience. If you go for it, one thing you'll definitely not have is regret.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Got it delivered in just 2 days! Big thumbs up to Amazon for prompt delivery 😁Have been using this since 2-3 days now.It's a decent device for the given price range.Bought Samsung as I had decided not to go for any Chinese brands and I have no regrets! Works smoothly.. Camera app has a lot of modes, takes some time to get used to it.Hyperlapse mode is superb!I have recorded videos for youtube..loved the inbuilt mic audio quality!Totally loved the video stabilization!I was able to get decent macro shots!Clicked pictures look natural & colorful.Can't wait to explore other modes of camera!Chinese applications like Helo, Tik Tok are preinstalled..a little disappointing.The camera quality could've been better...Pictures were pixelated...changed the quality of capturing images..got decent results...later I installed Google cam, works perfectly...enables to click crisp pictures.The USB cable is small and it's a bit annoying.Thinking of getting a fast charger as the one provided with device is just 15WBack cover is not provided in the box.Bought Samsung (it's mentioned that this device has been manufactured in India) as I had decided not to go for any Chinese brands and I have no regrets! Apart from these few cons, the device is really good for the given price! I'd suggest everyone to get this device rather than going for some other Chinese Brands!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Let me expand on first impression; the packaging was good, sturdy and sanitized — which is great. Smarphone came with all the accessories written on the box.There was no charge in the unit—odd I remembered samsung delivering fifty percent charge in there products, either way I did boot it up after leaving it for charge for around three hours — fast, responsive display, beautiful camera. And you can set settings of the display to natural colour.Software: As far as the Samsung's own UI is concern, I think it's intuitive, lacks some crazy fastness of AOSP or android one projects — but with the phone one is paying for the software as well. And might as well, use these OEMs rather than running something plain. It's stable so far and running great. Fingerprint is pretty fast, as fast as my other device poco F1Battery line is absolutely wonderful, it takes almost 3 hours I think to be fully charged, with standard usage it gives me screentime of around 36 hours sometimes 24, while playing PUBG or Call of duty.Camera quality: Well, I only have one word, impressive. Camera on this phone is social butterfly's or some serious smartphone photography, videography — although no video stabilisation in 4k mode.Some things to look out for: Phone body catches smudges easily, so get a cover if you are serious about it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  After purchasing this device I'm writing my opinion for Samsung Galaxy m31. Screen resolution absolutely stunning at first sight you will fall in love with it. About system presentation Samsung have really worked great on it to make it much better compared to its previous devices available in the market.Camera performance is some what not as per the expectations compared to the other devices with 64 mega pix.camera available in the market. Performance of the camera in low light is not that much good.Last but not the least regarding performance guys I'm still thinking after creating such a beautiful device why samsung have kept 1 lacuna i.e. processor chip set. Other brands are providing Snapdragon chip set which is much more powerful at this price segments while Samsung is lacking that which is some what found disappointing w.r.t. the performance. My recommended for samsung is to have Snapdragon chip set so that it will make a complete device.So guys if performance does not matters for you Just go for this device this is absolute beauti from a Samsung.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Very competitive mobile in the mid range category. Camera is fine but images do not look like 64 mp.PROS1. Amoled display2. Fingerprint reader3. Samsung UI 24. Battery (good for a day)CONS1. Processor (noticeable lags)2. Speakers are neither clear nor loud enough\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Well I would like to share my honest review after using it for more than a month. Below are some pros and cons of m311.Battery life is very decent. Last for one day with heavy usage, 1½ day with moderate usage and 2 days with light usage2. Performance is also great. But Snapdragon would have been better as this phone will disappoint you if u play pubg and other high graphics game. If you only use some basic apps for office work or you are a student and use study apps, then absolutely no issue with performance.3. Due to a larger mah battery, it is somewhat heavy, yet bearable.4. Camera quality is decent in day light, with focus mode and video recording is also good, but is disappoints in night light.5. OS is also good, with less ads and high security (one of the perks of being a Samsung mobile user)6. And at last, Super Amoled screen is awrsome, with vivid colours and natural outcast. If you like videos and movies, then you are gonna like it too.Conclusion: overall it is a great product. I would give it 9 points out of 10.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's a good phone in this price. However, since the price is low many security features in this phone is compromised like Secure Folder, Samsung Pay, Knox etc.  Since the price is low Samsung has taken off many of these features which were even available in the earlier J Series.Performance: Although this phone comes with 6 GB RAM the performance is good as A Series phones which almost comes in the same price.Camera: Camera quality is also not that good as A Series phones although M31 comes with 64 MP back and 32MP front camera.Battery: 6000mAh battery will come for one and half dayIf you are looking for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB Storage with better performance, I would rather suggest to go for A51 which will be little higher in price.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have been using this device for more than 2 weeks. I am an above-average user the battery lasts around 40 hrs plus. I am happy with the device.1. About the OLED screen: I can adjust the color saturation, I have reduced the color saturation as I am not that used to vivid OLED displays. Brightness is pretty decent one good feature is that we can reduce the brightness to a lower level such that I don't want to install any 'Dark mode' application for night use.2. Camera: Camera is pretty good, the wide-angle view is pretty handy when we don't have much space in the room. The front camera is also pretty decent on low light(Recommended).3. Weight: It is pretty heavy as it has a massive 6000mah battery. However, the weight is balanced so it is nice to hold on, we won't feel it too heavy when we hold it for a long time.4. Performance: Performance is a said as in the paper, I have tried Call of Duty and worked in medium graphics well.5.Bluetooth: Bluetooth is important for me as I usually take calls with my Voyager Wireless headphones. Connection time is extremely low . I could turn on my headphone while phone is ringing and the next second the headphone is connected. I used to wait/need to manually connect on my old Zenfone max. So this is a great value add for meNB: This is not a dedicated gaming phone.To conclude with this is a very good phone for people who travel a lot and watch movies , surf internet, attend online meetings during their travel. This is not the phone for gamers\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I would rather recommend this phone rather than the Samsung M31s since most of the features are already available in Samsung M31. Albeit the camera quality is a bit lower than M31s. If you click too many close range photos then I would suggest go for the M31s. But if that doesn't bother you then paying extra 2000 bucks for trivial enhancements is not worthy. The bad thing is that it does not come with a cover and you have to buy one from outside.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  i am giving this review after 4 months of use.First of all best budgeted mobile...its has ample of pros as well as some cons.pros,good design and looks classy without any cover.amazing back cam with lot of options especially ir emoji..performance is also good...tried pubg and call of duty simulationusly and worked without lagno heating issues.battery....oo my god best battery backup..not exaggerated....with proper usage it comes for full 2 days and battery saver mode is really a life saver....cons,extruded camera...little risky while keeping downback panel is soo glossy so finger print impression issue...I prefer not using cover so for me its issue.....some times audio is little less...I am not sure its issue of mobile or audio quality....overall I can give 8.5 out of 10.....\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Awesome phone\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  After one month of using samsung M31. I have a lots of experiences.Advantages:1. Camera quality is great in day light.2. Touch sensitivity is excellent.3. User interface is upto the mark.4. Sound quality is average and using earphone/headphone it is excellent.5. Charging time is fast with 6000mAh.Disadvangtages1. The most important thing as we know samsung battery backup is never satisfying any user compared to other brand. It does not last a day even if the screen is not continuous light. 2.8 out of 5.2. Exynos 9811 (10 nm), the processor is not upto mark as it consumed huge battery which is unexpected. Also, it somtimes delay/hang phone.3. One major disadvantage is the signal strength. It is not getting a proper signal while other brand are using full speed on the same place.4. Camera is hopeless at low light.Note: The battery and the signal strength really needs to improved and I hope the battery backup improve with system update.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Almost everything is perfect!• The \"best part\" of it is its battery which lasts for almost 10 hours of heavy usage. Mediocre usage will last for like 1.5 days, ideal for long train journeys!• The camera quality is very good.• It stutters sometimes while heavy usage.• Google Due video calling was a bit laggy.• Don\\'t know about gaming performance as I don\\'t use it for gaming purpose.• 128GB feels like you don\\'t need any storage device anymore. It\\'s like you have your work related each and every thing in your pocket.• Experience of viewing videos at night in an amOLED screen is blissfull.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Camera is average( its good but not good as 64mp)Earpiece is small so you have to aim it to ear otherwise you will not hear other person's voice properlyOnly these two thing i didn't like otherwise phone is very goodBattery is fantastic (with normal usage it runs 3-4 days without charging but usage varies from person to person)Performance is great( i have 6gb ram 128gb internal varient)Bulid quality is also good as per price rangeSmooth and fastDisplay is bestComes with latest softwareFast fingerprintSound quality also goodAnd overall i liked this phone just only the two things i mentioned above that i dont like, thats why one star less\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Pro :ui Is goodBattery life is goodSamsung has good display.Calling  bluetooth , sound, wifi , everything good.Camera is okay not that bad.

(I am not a gamer)2. Camera- good at day light shots(front & back). Definitely need improvement at low light conditions. Same camera performes better than this at Realme& Redmi.3.Display- Super Amoled- best4. It does not feel too heavy even though with 6000 mAh battery.5. Android 10- Samsung's One UI2. Latest with great GUI.6. Finger print sensor- fast with great response.Cons:1.Exynos 9611 processor - average. Not meant for gamers.2. Plastic back.3. Charging- ~2.5 hrs to fuel the battery full4.Focus hunting- While recording video camera struggles to focus. You feel it only when viewed on big screens.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The camera a above decent, it gets nice picture when given proper light. Took videos as well bt for slow motion videos u need natural light, the camera app won't trigger slow motion under low light. Having said that, the pictures are too good given the price range.Coming to battery! U can easily stretch 2 days wid average use, even with battery below 20 percent u can easily game for 1-2 hrs (personal exp). Its a beast when it comes to battery, the only con is the amount of time it takes to charge.The fingerprint reader acts fast bt due to flat nature with the back of tge phone it gets difficult to locate, if ur using a case then no problems. But wid no case u have to locate fingerprint reader, a slight curve wud have been great!Rest I have been using the phone for more than 1 month and d phone fell for more that 7 times bt till now the front screen is intact. There are scratches on the back bt build quality in terms of front glass is awesome.I would suggest any1 to buy!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  One of the best options in the segment.I preferred this phone for its sAMOLED display  and I am very happy  with it's look and performance.  To my surprise software one UI is smooth performing and practical.  Samsung's galaxy M series has been trustworthy brand against many aggressive competitors. Packaging and charger design could have been better. Anyhow satisfied with choice.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I bought 6+128gb version on offer. I always wanted a phone which had a very good battery and this phone didn't disappoint me. It's 64mp camera is best in its class. I am satisfied with the phone. It doesn't have constant ads like xiomi or any other brands and it's User interface is very smooth. Fingerprint sensor is fast and exynos didn't disappoint me either. It's pretty fast. If you want to buy a made in India smartphone which in it's production have given some jobs to our countrymen then go for it else choose some Chinese brand who is just assembled in India and doesn't add to our GDP. One big factor why i bought it is because of availabilty of its geniune spare parts.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is my first Samsung phone. My family and friends everybody is using Samsung from longtime, so i thought i should try Samsung now. So i ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 as it was the latest phone with better config than any other phones and also the price was reasonable as compared to others.When i received my phone and when i started using it it was marvelous. I read the comments and reviews before purchasing and got mixed reviews about the phone. But when i started using it and noticed about the comments and reviews as given by the others, it was nothing like that. Camera is Superb and Macro feature is awesome. Battery performance is good, display is magical, slightly heating when playing games like COD Mobile, Pubg and Fortnite but it's common.Overall, the phone is really a MegaMoster. The price is good, features are awesome, body is good, sleek design.As per my opinion, buy this and get amazed with best quality and services by Samsung. A value for money phone.Thanks to read this. and Thank you Samsung for giving me this amazing experience.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Thank you @amazon.in for delivering it real quick.*This phone has an amazing battery life, the UI is superb and smooth.*Performance is good if you are an average gamer but however, you can play high-end games too :P*Does not have few bloatware or pre-installed apps, you can uninstall these apps later point of time.*Andriod 10*The camera is no doubt on par with its competitors but yes when it comes to low light photography you might feel a pinch..but I am sure not many of us do low light photography...however Camera performance is 8 out of 10.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  SAMSUNG M31 is one of the most gorgeous and elegant smartphone in 'M' series.

Also, there is a lockdown, when contacted customer care asking to bring to Samsung Stores. This was the wrong decision to buy this product. Also after using this product for 5 months, suddenly mobile became black screen, Went to service centre, they have mentioned that they don't have spares for M31 and it may take at least 1 month for repair. That also they have not assured. Now you please decide before you buy the same.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  At this price it will be a very good phone who has using other brands. Please find the below after using 5 days:Pros:1. Good camera quality, we can feel the change of picture.2. Battery life is awesome as of now. It is giving more than a day.3. Touch screen is very sensitive and I loved it while typing.4. Automatic light mode, which is very  good option and it as acting as per need based on our adjustments on timely basis.5. Optins wise also it has many features that we can enable  for the smart usage.6. Quality of sound is awesome.... feel like we are in theater. Have DolbyAtmos option to change the sound effect. It depends on how you feel it.Cons:1. Vedio of the quality not that much  expected. Not sure there might  be some configurations. Not checked as of now.2. Feeling little heat when we are on the sim card net. Also when we are on calls l, even this  also may be initially.Finally with the above pros and cons we can buy it wth out comparing other products which are available on the market.Thank you.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Using this phone for couple of months.-Finger print sensor worst 1 out of 8 times read correctly.-Speed super slow for this specs.- Adaptive brightness not calibrated, it will give flash to eyes while using in dark and u have to manually change it.-Back panel quality poor, gets scratches easily.- Main reason was battery but doesnt work more thn 12 hours with normal usage on 100% charge\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I came to Samsung galaxy M31 straight from using Samsung J7 pro in few days, so it felt like shedding an extra layer of skin which is lighter and more manageable with a soft touch over its screen. Its extremely well balanced and easy to hold and navigate with one hand. Display which feels like absolute best of all words - beautiful colors, perfect viewing angles, incredible 6000mAh battery etc. I would recommend trying both and seeing whether usage allows you to maintain a high fresh rate because its absolutely worth it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Samsung phones essentially have the best price-to-feature ratio. The surprise factor with the Samsung M31 is the camera. It is absolutely amazing. The picture quality is just too good. In any mode, it is stunning. And then the other features, be it the battery life, the sound quality, the video quality, or the processing speed, are at par with the best. I dont think that at this price point, any other company can pack in even half the features. Buying this phone is an absolute no-brainer.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I HAVE RECEIVED SAMSUNG M31 HANDSET ON DATED 22-07-2020, BUT NOW TILL DATE I HAVE FACED NETWORK PROBLEM IN M31, BOTH SIM ARE VOLTE BUT WHEN WE HAVE OPERATE FOR ONLINE CLASS THAN 4G GOING TO 3G, SAME SIM USED IN OLD HANDSET THAN WE HAVE NOT FACE THIS PROBLEM,  VERY WORST PRODUCT IN AGAINST OF MY OLD SAMSUNG J7, AMAZON SERVICE IS POOR , THEY HAVE PROVIDED AMAZON HOME SERVICE THAN AFTER RETURN OR REPLACE POLICY, BUT THEY HAVE GIVEN ME 3 TIME SAME PERSON CONTACT NO WHO HAS LEAVE JOB LAST 6 MONTH, I VERY HELP LESS FOR RETURN BECAUSE AMAZON CALL CENTER PERSON FOOLISH TO ME 4 TIMES FOR SERVICE.

No physical damage is on the body of the phone, then also they are talking that it is due to high pressure on the phone.

There'sa slight learning curve to get the most out of it's quad camera system. There are many features to explore in the camera software.As far as bloatware are concerned, I haven't seen any intrusive bloatware or ads. In fact, it has the cleanest UI with no compromises in terms of privacy and security.Battery life is really good. Charged 100% tgis morning 6 am and since then using it (writing this review at 7:30pm and it still has 57% battery) for photography and video making.The processor coupled with 6GB RAM + 128GB storage makes it surprisingly fast.Overall, this is a great phone for any one looking value for money.A lot better than smartphones from rivals like OnePlus, Huawei, Xiaomi, Realme, and Vivo.GO FOR IT...\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Its Exynos 9611 Processor, Rear Quad camera setup with wide angle and macro shot capability, 6 GB RAM and most importantly its price (Comparable to many Chinese smartphones). I ordered 2-phones, one was delivered on 8th July and the other on 16th July 2020. I am using this phone for normal usage and for Amazon prime to view movies.The only problem I am facing sometimes is the net connectivity issue when Samsung Max VPN is ON (May be Ultra data saving mode is ON). When I put it off, then the connectivity resumes. Overall, its a great phone. I strongly recommend to buy it over Chinese make smartphones. Now the Samsung Galaxy M31s is also available with an infinity display with a price of Rs.2000 more.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The phone is good but am facing intermittent issues with internet connectivity especially when using phone hotspot. Amazon although says 10 day return policy but it directs me to some app to check my phone or call Amazon expert whose calls have a wait time of 20 minutes. Later I had to call Samsung customer care to get it resolved but problem persists. DO NOT PURCHASE MOBILE PHONES ONLINE.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  On the day, the mobile was released I couldn't hold my excitement and ordered this Monster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything else from this except battery life. I needed a smartphone with bigger battery that lasts longer than usual so that I can do everything that I want to.Talking about the battery life, it works as promised. On Wifi, I used continuously on Day 1, and it took 21hrs to drain from 100% to 0%. And I tested on mobile data the next day, it took around 15hrs to drain completely. Im super impressed with the battery life that I will blindly get a smartphone from Samsung if it has a big battery.Fingerprint reader and Face recognition are pretty fast. I was never expecting this speed at all. Camera quality is really good. I always had doubts in mind about cameras in Samsung, but this one cleared off everything. I feel proud to have this when I see the pictures on other handsets.Many people have misconceptions and complain about the processor in Samsung mobiles. Actually, it all depends on your usage. Processors in Samsung handsets aren't outdated, they deliver pretty good performance. I never had any such problem.The mobile is not lightweight like other mobiles. But, a 6000mah smartphone of today will definitely have this much weight. I hope the design will change in future to have a lightweight smartphone with bigger battery.Finally, I want to conclude that if you want a phone that targets Productivity, M series is best. And M31 is the King of this segment.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  My review comes after a 15 day use with the M31.The features offered by this phone at this range is really astonishing.Let it be the monstrous 6000mAh battery or the clean One UI or the Processor.I was a bit confused at first with the Processor as I felt Snapdragon offered by other manufacturers had an upper hand over the Exynos, but I am clearly mistaken as the performance of Exynos is on par with a 7 series Snapdragon (Exynos might even be better than Snapdragon).I have not faced any kinds of issues with high end gaming or continous usage.The next big thing about this phone is the Battery, the 6000mAh battery is actually the real deal.Under heavy usage I have got a battery backup of nearly 18hours.Even with the monstrous battery the phone is lightweight and easy to carry.Samsung has offered decent 64mp quad back camera which also houses an 8mp wide camera and a 32 mp front camera.In my personal opinion the M31 camera stands ahead when compared with its competitor Motorola Fusion.The fingerprint sensors are backmounted instead of inscreen unlike the new normal.The backmounted fingerprint sensor seems to be faster than the inscreen fingerprint sensors provided on the Samsung A70 smartphone.But at times I have faced issues with slow detection on my M31.Disregarding this small problem the M31 is the perfect budget phone currently in the market.I as a customer of Samsung highly recommend you to purchase this mobile phone.Worth every penny.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Giving a review after 5 months of heavy usage so worth reading.Pros-1. Unlike every other Samsung phone which is not apt for gaming , this is the one friend. Many said me that don't go for it if you want to play but it never lagged or heated up while playing high end games.Super smooth usage and interface.2. Camera is drop dead awesome. It literally justifies the 64 mp quad camera.3. I guess no one can give a negative comment on the sleek and classy look of the phone. It feels great to hold and 10 on 10 for looks.4. Screen resolution and quality is also super fine.Cons-1. The quick charge is almost equal to normal and there is nothing to get excited about.2. The battery is unable to justify 6000 mah as it claims. Other brands offering 4000mah lasts equal to this and after good all day usage u need to plug it again in the night. I expected that 6000mah will go 2 days easily but not in this case.Conclusion- After such detailed analysis after 5 months, I can easily say that the pros can easily oustand the cons and this is one of the best budget phone Samsung has offered. And with such a reliable tag of Samsung, go for it without a second thought.You will see that the other brands will offer somewhat same features in little less price but I would suggest you to go for this as this deserves the every extra penny spend, and ofcourse not a Chinese product.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am writing this review after 2 days of usage. I was very excited at first about this phone when it came but now I am very disappointed with it. After using for some time, I put it on charge at 10% battery and after 3 hours it was just 54%, even after 9 hours of continuous charging, it could only charge upto 74%. Also, the mobile data doesn't work after some time. We need to switch off the SIM and then ON it for further usage. I am really disappointed with Samsung. Now there is no option of returning the phone and all my money is now wasted. This policy of Amazon just proves to be a big problem for genuine buyers.Okay so after 4 days, now the charging issue is automatically solved, while sometimes the network issue still persists. Overall I am now satisfied with the product.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Here is The Review of my New M31 Samsung Galaxy Phone with 6 GB Ram and 128 GB Storage. As i m owner of CSC and having BC Point. I need phone with more data storage and fast Processor. So i bought Samsung M31 phone. It has most big advantage of having 6000 MaH Battrey which gives longer time to talk and to manage all things. Secondary thing is about storage, it also had more space for downloading big movies, songs and other documents. I love this phone also bcoz it has a feature of Dual VOLTE, which provides unlimited connectivity which means we can use Both Networks on 4G. For me i m satisfied with overall performance of this phone. So i m refering All to buy a best Samsung Galaxy S31.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Writing this review after 1 Month of Usage Best Budget Samsung.-The battery life is truly monstrous 10/10. (Checked from morning 100%, gaming, YT, Netflix, music, surfing throughout the day..it was still at 57% after 16hrs of use)-The screen is the best, super amoled no match. 10/10.- Sound and BT quality 10/10.- UI is great, from touch to usability is 10/10.- So many gesture and features.- Fingerprint reader is not as fast as other same range Chinese phones 9/10.- Camera is super cool and with lots of modes (quality resolution definitely can be better than phone under same budget and specifications) 64Mega pixel quality not upto the mark- Memory and performance 9/10.- Looks could be more stylish yet feels premium and good inhand 8.5/10-  overall I rate it solid 9/10Specs and other factors same as mentioned in product details.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Internet connectivity is very poor in this device. The same sim card in the same location in this device is rarely catching 4g whereas in other device (ipad/ vivo u20) it is always catching 4g. Hence In the sense of internet connectivity the performance of this device is very poor. If you like to have good internet irrespective of network provider you should definitely avoid this device. Now I am in a situation where I do not know what to do with this highly priced useless device.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Pros- Display is awesome, Satisfied with camera quality and battery life is too good ..No lag issue till now..Cons- Slow Charging speed takes 2.5 hour to charge full.Overall a good phone inhand feeling is also very good ..\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  coming from a Samsung S7 Edge, I always wanted a phone with an awesome screen and a good battery life. This phone has them both. Its a bit heavier than the S7 Edge, but it is because of the 6000mah battery. My usage is average and I have never experienced and issue with his one. first charging I felt that the phone was heating but that has stopped after the first software upgrade. Awesome phone for a budget.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Awesome performance till now. Writing this after 4months of usage. Battery life excellent. Camera quality excellent. Does heat heat up sometimes while charging. Fingerprint reader average if compared to Mi phones. Should be an excellent purchase for a moderate user.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Awesome performance, I have used this mobile for almost 4 months and after that I'm sharing my view on this.Pros:Good Camera (In day light)Best batteryVery good performanceNever get hangAwesome UITimely android updates and patch upCons:Take more than 2 hours to fully chargeModerate camera performance in low lightLittle bulky when compare to other same range mobilesOverall it provide a good support in the given price band. Everyone has their own priority based on that one may like or not. This review is based on my priority and experience.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Handson experience after 10 days.Really disappointing product from Samsung. This is utlra hyped product. Its a marketing stratagy of samsung to promote it. Only battery is the feature of the phone which last around 1.5 days on heavy usage. i am a game freak and it is good for that.The camera is pathetic mark my word pathetic its a 8 megapixel camera which they branding as 64 megapixel. when you zoom after cl8cking a photo there is no details. its all blurred out and you feel cheated like anything. the selfie camera sucks. Overall experience is bitter. I really dont like the smartphone. it is all plastic body and quite compressable. I have oppo reno phone i felt it is 1000% guinine than this cheating phone. Be aware before you buy. 2 star is only for battrry only battrry.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The battery life of this product is best so far even with heavy usage and gaming the battery stays for more than a dayCamera quality is amazingIt's not very heavy and has a sleek designSamsung has kept its focus on the cameras as the Galaxy M31 touts a 64MP quad camera setup. Other key Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications include a Super AMOLED display, 6,000mAh battery and Android 10 softwareThe front of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is familiar as well, as you're greeted by a 6.4-inch full HD+ (2,340 x 1,080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display, much like its predecessors. The display gets a U-shaped notch up top that houses a selfie camera and a fairly thick chin.Thanks to a glossy rear panel, the Galaxy M31 is a fingerprint and smudge magnet, something which is quite noticeable on the black colour variant that we received for review. Moreover, the rear panel attracts scratches if you place it on a table or in your pocket along with some keys.This mobile is the best in affordable range\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  1) Heating issue can be experienced frequently while using YouTube, downloading, uploading, updates and during charging. Few restrictions of disabling location and background apps when not in use reduces the heating issues.2) huge 6000 Mah battery but backup not up to the mark as it should be. Similar backup in my previous vivo with 3400 mah battery.3) camera 64MP but similar quality pics compared to other 48MP pics of vivo and realme.Except above, the phone is nice and good option if you don't want to purchase Chinese brands as in my case.4) very long charging time more than 2.5 hrs. It should be made fast by samsung.5) should be provided with  in box accessories like screen guard, earphones.6) backcover to be made more attractive and qualityOverall phone is good with nice display, camera features, good pics, good video recording.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The features provided in the phone are good but what broke my trust from samsung is that despite having a 6GB RAM, i see some glitch while using this phone. There is bit of a lag while using this phone which is seriously not expected from samsung. I am disappointed in samsung on buying this product.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  \\xa0Honesty saying I'm totally satisfied and happy with this one. All in all everything is great, the interface, the display and the battery is to die for, and as for the camera the video and picture quality is also great, it lags only when it comes to night camera as it takes a bit of time to getting used to, like initially I thought the night photos looked like some oil pastel painting but now after the update and some use it's better. The features are very nice too.I also used redmi 9 pro max as I ordered that one before so I can say that I've had the opposite to compare both and I found the samsung m31 a lot more better than the redmi set which had some heating issues and some kind of camera launching issue.The super amoled display is awesome, it is a very good looking smart phone, the battery can last up upto 36 to 40 hours and it takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to charge completely from zero to hunder. The camera quality is also very good and have many additional available options and features.The processor is very efficient as I've played many games without facing any lag or problem, also I binge watch for long hours and the experience is great.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  After almost a month of standard use. I must say I am happy with the battery life, it lasts almost two days. The touch is butter smooth. A good and bright display. The finger print is super fast. The camera quality could have been better, not happy with it. As I owned a Lumia 950 earlier, I still feel the display and camera of Lumia is better than this one.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  \\xa0camera is awesome...battery is very nice..I  satisfied by this product.....\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The best budget phone no smartphone can match. Imagine a battery that needs no charging. Lol. At least two days.What camera? Wow...Speed...how many cores...just like boss ...wow...I just hate samsung UI...let android UI be. I shifted from Xiaomi, honor and iPhone.. But never had issues but with this phone I have to unlearn every android or iOS simplicity. Samsung UI is complex. I just have to ask Google everytime for small things like finger print gestures.All in all I would unlearn everything ahhahahah...thanks samsung!!!!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Pros:1. First time sAmoled user, this screen is so great. When you low the brightness then it actually become very low which is good in night. In sunlight it glows.2. Colors are so vibrant and good that i just look at the 4k videos and just keep admiring its quality.3. Touch is so smooth that it feels very light.4. Android 10 is a charm. Loads of functionality. And that too very useful.5. Battery couldn't be more great. Though it takes time to charge but once charged then it goes all day night long.6. Sound is superb. Speaker are crisp clear audio without any glitch. Call quality is great. I can talk so easily now.7. Dolby Atmos is a charm. Its headphones sound quality is super.8. Camera is great. It captures details. Although its not a dslr but its good.9. Build quality couldn't be better. Gorilla glass makes it more good.Cons:1. Battery charger is very low like 15w which is below market standards.2. Top notch could have been more smaller like a dot display.3. Processer are low end.4. Front camera lacks quality\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I won\\'t bore you with the techie stuff in the beginning..that will come later on...PS:go towards the end of the comment if you wanna have a detailed review.Overall a good phone , good performance ( it\\'s been 1 month since I\\'ve been using the phone) .A very good alternative to Chinese phones you can control a huge number of ads i.e no vulgar ads popping on your notification list in the morning..thank god for that.I just have one complaint the back got scratched in this one month.. so buy a cover along with the phone.The boring techie analysis:The phone has improved 64MP quad rear camera,8MP for extra wide angle shorts,5MP for macro photos and 5MP for depth and 32MP front facing camera A rear  mounted finger scanner which works amazingly... Now comming to the screen, the phone comes with FHD 6.4\" super AMOLED infinity display  with infinity-U cut this is a full HD display with amazing screen quality.Internals:It works on 1UI version2 i.e. Android 10With Exynos 9611 octacore processor with10nm.Finally 6000mAh battery USB-C Port and Samsung\\'s 15Watt adaptive fast charging\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Good phone I like it very much because of its camera and battery life and also it has many great features . It has smart look, beautiful design,sleekness.overall it is a very useful product for me.camera is too good for taking pictures. It has very nice fingerprint sensor. It has also other intellegent options like hand Screenshot. Facereader is very good option for unlocking the phone.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Dont go for the negative reviews, they have been written by the noobs who dont know how to adjust settings. Coming to the point. It is decent phone (not a very great one) but i was tired of Ads in my previous realme phone so i bought this.Pros-BatteryCameraDisplayUIPricingSamsung BrandNo AdsCons-Facelock is not goodspeakers are averageprocessor is not comparable to industry standard ( but any game can be smoothly played on it )\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A marvelous phone at great price which can compete with any phone in its category in all aspects and can beat them hands down. Long battery life to sustain for more than one and a half day, responsive fingerprint reader including retinal scan and a great camera to shoot at various angles.  The nail in the coffin is that its NON CHINESE and this is the minimum we can do to support the cause in such a situation. Only one demerit is that its slightly heavy, may be due to 6000 mah bty. Overall a highly recommended budget phone.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  My mom has been constantly complaining of issues with the phone, i.e. like the phone keyboard sometimes not responding to touch, the audio jack breaking the earphone sound, the fingerprint not always responding. Or not getting the calls over whats-app.She has used Android phones for a long time already.So i think most could be software problems, so i installed appropriate once for her to make it work better. I am still looking up on the internet if the phone has some persistent hardware or software issues, like with the wifi card because of which intermittent connectivity problems could occur.The phone works fairly fine when i am using it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Fingerprint reader at a weird place, if you use covers it'll be even more difficult to use.Fairly good face detection, so I use that often to unlock phone. Though difficult to detect when in dark.Super artificially enhanced and processed output from both the cameras. Would love some naturals captures that's just impossible. Not a good camera. Aap you can see in the first picture, the room is moderately lit but image is pretty bright, the details are lacking and the image is not as sharp. The second image is of outdoors, good lighting and a little enhanced colours, though if I zoom in the picture will be distorted and lacks details, which is not expected from a 64 mp camera.Amazing display, lovely colours. Same goes with the touch.Battery lasts for well more than a day on moderate usage with data on all day long, which is great.Performance is good, not best not poor either.Don't play games at all, no clue/opinion about it.Great after sales service, I received a call to check in and review the device. Looking forward to get some significant improvements in upcoming products.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Reviewing After 1Month of Use..Huge battery of 6000mAh😱..after full charge it give a backup of nearly 22 hrs (based on how u use)Amoled screen is just phenomenal🔥..(u can\\'t question it..) even in sunlight it works perfectly💯...Camera quality is good❤️ as per price..(and in this price range I just Love its camera)Speakers are loud enough..audio output is good..I tried heavy gaming in this (which I don\\'t usually play😅) and the phone works perfectly fine...It is obvious one may find phone a little weighted bcoz of heavy battery..What I don\\'t like is the \"15w charger\"😖(It takes 120 - 150 min to get full charge)I mean with such a huge battery of 6000mAh company should provide a 25w charger..\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  A good budget phone with some pretty decent features.I've used it for almost 10days. So according to me the pros and cons are listed below.Pros-----* Color reproduction of camera is nice and display the almost accurate colors.* Video stabilization is up to the mark* Amoled screens are always glamorizing* AI battery optimization (depending on your usage pattern the battery will auto optimize. It'll take some to time to learn the pattern)* Many levels of customization including fonts, themes, gestures, etc.* Processor is good enough to handle day to day multitasking. I don't play games on regular basis but games like pubg, asphalt and cod are playble (at 45-60fps). Some graphics tweaks will boost the performance.* Single speaker but loud enough for basic usageCons------* Charging takes almost 2h 45m to boost from 0 to 100.* Night mode could be optimized.Go for this phone if you're looking for a budget phone with decent features, good security patterns, long battery life and an amazing camera for outdoor and selfie shots.Note: This phone may not be suitable for gamers due to the exonys Processor. According to the benchmarks it's more powerful than a SD 675 but slower than SD 720. Go for phones with 720G or 730G.#MadeInIndia\\n\\n\"]\n"
