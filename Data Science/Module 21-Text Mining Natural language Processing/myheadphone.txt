"1" "        The sound quality is amazing; the loudness, crispness and bass is very good.But, there is a delay in the sound when you watch any video.I tried with two phones, also tried with Laptop, still there is always a half second delay.This has completely turned me off.Has anyone else faced the same problem?Is there any solution for this?  "
"2" "        I'll start with the positive things:+ Materials are of good quality. I would even say it feels premium.+ As other reviewers have said, the battery life is excellent.+ I didn't experience the 1 second video delay that other reviews are talking about. The sound was always perfectly in sync.+ Sound quality is passable.And now for the deal breakers:- The headset is a very tight fit for a normal human being. I'm small built and even for me, the headphone is a squeeze tight fit which hurts my ears.- After about 5 minutes of use, the audio gets a distorted tone which goes away only when the phone's bluetooth is disconnected and re-connected- The sound quality is really average. Nothing to write home about. The highs are tinny at best.- When using the wired line through the pc jack, the microphone isn't routed through the headset.And the killer con for joggers:- The headsets right earbud has all the controls and they are made of loosely fit  hard plastics which means they do rattle significantly. When I tried to jog with these, I could hear a marked clunk every step. Really horrible.I've requested a replacement, hoping it's just a problem with my piece. Will update based on that.  "
"3" "        Pros: Battery life is good (though haven’t tested exactly how many hours), fit is comfortable, can be used for long hours.Cons: Issues with mic, never worked properly.[Update after 2 yrs usage] The mic always had issue, never worked (could never use to talk to people on phone or PC apps, like Skype).The faux leather used isn't reliable, check the image, this started happening after an year usage. And I keep my things with care.The headset sometimes disconnects while in use, not sure why.A new issue has started happening for last 6 months: while watching a video, sometimes (by itself) the audio just garbles, changes to weird noise. I have to switch off and on the headsets to get the normal audio.One of friends also bought this, and he has also complained about these issues.After considering all the cons, I feel this is a bad purchase.  "
"4" "        This Bluetooth headphone is very good for listening to music on the go. If you want to play games and watch videos on mobile or laptop then forget the good experience. It has a noticeable audio delay because it does not Bluetooth aptx or aptxHD codec. Things I like about this headphone are mentioned below.1. Great battery life ( i gets more than 10hrs battery life in continuous usage)2. Good build quality3. Great sound output4. very comfortable for long usage.if you want to use it for gaming or video you must have to use AUX cable that comes along with this for low latency.My overall experience is very good with this headphone.I  "
"5" "        I was searching for good headphone.. but this is one which i decided to go with, but it has not disappointed me.it is same as shown..Pros-1) it looks decent and classy.. tap buttons on it enhances its look. metal protection adds up beauty.2) adjustable earpiece to move forward and backward.3) Earcups are soft as shown.. very soft.4) it has given cute pouch , i loved it.. as it was unexpected.5) bass lovers would love it6) noise cancellation is good with sound quality.7) Not heavy... its super light.Cons-1) very delicate ! - material of ear cups is leather and is delicate otherwise rest is fine2) yes while video without aux - time lags of almost 5 secs. but that goes with almost all headphone.but it is very reasonable, you would not get such a multi-functional headphone at this price.while boAt has made its Hallmark over headphones- i loved it.  "
"6" "         Material: overall materials is good but the outside wire is very thin not good that wire. The headphones upper finishing with leather that was goodBattery : battery life is very good compared to other headphonesSounds : excellent bass I love it Bro noise reducesI got 1999<U+20B9>just. Don't buy 2500<U+20B9>,3000...ect. Just wait for deal  "
"7" "        Product delivered to me was not a brand new product. Some screws were rusted and there was a scratch so that you can easily understand it was opened and repaired after manufacturing or refurbished product was delivered at price of new product. This was not expected from Amazon. Product is really nice. Sound quality is really very good. Battery life is simply amazing, feels light weight but you can't wear it for longer time it starts paining to the ears as the band is lil hard.  "
"8" "        Pathetic...The sound quality is good BUT there is a BIG problem with this, that is you can't connect while you're in a car it would connect after little struggle then your main problem starts, you couldn't listen anything clearly it's like err...err..err that's it and this same problem repeats  even in home if put fan on, I believe this device Bluetooth is week hence a fan air can interrupt or a moving car can interrupt this device and mobiles Bluetooth connectivity  "
"9" "        Defective product.Package seal were broken.  "
"10" "        Blindly go for it guys. I went for it as I was very confident about the clarity of sound and the thumping bass. But the one reason I went for it was the advertised 20 hrs battery life. Be it Bluetooth earphones/headphones, I have never seen or heard of any earphone/headphone which can go on for more than 18-19 hrs straight. But I was shocked to see the headphones lasting me on average every single time playback time of more than 27 hrs+!!! Incredible to say the least. Only one concern is the wire on both the sides of the headphones. Just hoped Boat could have concealed them within the band for a more durable feel. Else a ROCKING CHOICE FOR MUSIC LOVERS!!!  "
"11" "        Really nice product at this price. I've tried bluedio, Sony, Panasonic, Philips, sennheiser in similar price range, both wired and wireless. This is what I feel:Light weight and comfortable. I've been using it for two hours and I'm not feeling any stress. Ear muff would be better if circle, but still really comfortable.Decent sound quality. It still does not beat bluedio in bass and sennheiser in audio quality but range us conformable. I felt treble is but low. Base is not too strong but cover great range.Design looks classy and great to know that we can fold it, but wire extruding from speaker to headband and extruding metal to adjust is driving me nuts. This makes is vulnerable to external damages.Battery life I've not tested but anyway showing 60% used after unboxing and using for hour.Biggest disappointment is video audio lag. There's 600ms delay because boat use older decompression technology. Even cheaper chineese headset does not have this lag. Don't consider this to watch serious drama video where you have to focus on character face. Really good for music.My verdict, buy only if it is costing less than 2000. Nothing great about this. It's actually a disappointment after reading so many reviews saying positive about it.  "
"12" "        I recieved the product on 29-9-2018 .The packing was so horrible(Just an amazon cover over the product box), By the time i recieved the box seals were opened,  both box sides were opened/damaged.The accessories and headphone was partially out of the box.Coming to product , Recieved refurbished one (screws were rusted)Performance not up to the mark(Low sound and bass and voice quality compared to cheap 1200rs headphone which i had.Bass ratio different in speakers(Ears starts paining)Significant audio lag in videosSometimes the sound stops and we have to disconnect and reconnect bluetooth again and again. I am not satisfied with this product.Returning it  "
"13" "        Awesome - amazing product with in the price range. good bass ,good clarity, easy connect,  look wise need some improvement, i bought it for 2990i got it for good deal, now the price is more about 1 k  "
"14" "        Awesome...just superb..I got this at 1999 rupees. Very nice beat, bass. At this price you won't find this quality. Go for it.  "
"15" "        Lags in many situation. While playing games like pubg. Even lags while watching YouTube.Here are some Pros and Cons for you......Pros=1.good battery life(5-7 days on 2-3 hours of play daily)2.you get a carrying pouch3.quality of product is actually good.4.sound quality is v.good5.bass is insane in headphone.Cons=1.Lags a lot in watching YouTube and all kind of stuff. Even lags while playing games like pubg. Works perfectly fine on using with aux cable.2.not good on low tones.3.not all instruments in song can be listened  properly  "
"16" "        First of all it sometimes gave Bluetooth compatibility issues with my Android device.So,I ordered for a replacement.The second product was not as good as the first one.It was old and the leather ear part seemed to be old one.Sound quality of the second one was not upto mark.So,I ordered for a refund and brought JBL headphones from its official website harmanAudio.in.  "
"17" "         I am posting my review after 5 days of usage. I have tried to be detailed and comprehensive as far as possible. I will discuss my review in terms of the following factors.<U+25BA><U+25BA> DELIVERY & PACKAGINGReceived the product within 2 days of ordering. Thanks to Amazon for superfast delivery. The packaging was proper and fine. The accessories received along with the headphone are an auxiliary cable, usb cable, user manual and warranty card plus a carrying pouch.<U+25BA><U+25BA> BUILT, DESIGN AND PORTABILITYThe built is pretty decent and sturdy. It has a premium outlook. Since I have ordered the Brown Colour I have to take extra precaution by keeping it in a Headphone Case so it doesn’t get dirty. The faux leather is very good and soft (see the video attached). However with regular usage it is bound to wear and tear and loose its original colour.The buttons are strategically placed and easily functionable. There were no issues with functionality of the buttons.<U+25BA><U+25BA> COMFORTABILITYThe first time I put on the headphones I faced a quite lot of discomfort on my ears as the ears cups are tightly compressing against my ears. As such I had to take off the headphones time and again for few seconds to relax my ears and then put it back again.But after 2 - 3 days usage though the intial discomfort  i felt had reduced, compression against my ears can be felt.Its pretty light  weight a'd easily manageable on your head. There was no discomfort in that issue.<U+25BA><U+25BA> BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITYNow I will address this point on two key factors.  1) Whether there is any Audio Delay while watching Online videos (via Bluetooth) and  2) Mic Quality. (via Bluetooth).First the issue of audio lag have been addressed by many users. The bluetooth version on my smartphone is 4.1 which is same as the headset.I noticed there was an audio delay of 300 - 500 ms. I have watched entire series of Chernobyl and few other movies online. The delay at all times was same. I didn't face an issue of 1 - 5 secs as some people have addressed in their review.As regard to the mic quality, I wanted to find out two things primarily voice clarity and if it have any connectivity while making call (wireless) .So I placed a call to one of friends and spoke to him close to an hour. During the course of the conversation I started moving a bit further away from the phone. Intially I stood  3 or 4 feet away then 10 feet away and finally went to my adjacent room and then to a another room beside it , while the phone at all time was at kept at on my desk at the same exact position. During the entire conversation I did not face any kind of voice distortion or breakage in connection. At the end of conversation I enquired my friend whether he faced any connectivity problems or any other kind while talking to me. His answer was negative.I would also like point out that while listening to music i kept the phone on my bed then i went to an adjacent room (at least5-6 feet apart from phone) separated by wall in between then to my study room (15 - 20 feet apart from phone), the connectivity did not break down, i could easily change tracks forward and backward and switch on and off music buttonthere were no issues.<U+25BA><U+25BA> LOUDNESS AND BASS The loudeness and bass is always make or break point for any headset.I have noticed that if I’m are listening to music the sound, bass and treble is really impressive . The sound is brilliant and HD quality like.The bass is brilliant too. You can really hear every instruments in the song and accordingly varies with the lows and highs of the soundtrack.But it really did not impress me while watching online movies. The loudness is significantly subdued as compared to when listening to music. I had to use to volume booster app from play store to augment the sound.Same issue with bass. Not really impressive for online movies.<U+25BA><U+25BA> NOISE CANCELLATIONFirst and foremost I would like to point out that this is a passive On The Ear Headphones. So unlike Over The Ear Headphone the noise cancellation will be less. Plus I have also pointed out that these are excellent for listening songs so surrounding sounds will be less audible when listening to songs but not much when watching a movie online.The surrounding sounds are easily distinctly audible. As such you can’t be fully immersed the movie.<U+25BA><U+25BA> Battery Backup.I had given a full charge once i received the product. After excess of 3-4 hours of daily usage for past 5 days the battery indicated 60%. so my verdict is that battery backup is excellent.I will conclude that if you are an avid music listner then these are the headphones within this budget would be agood purchase.Buy if you an online movie buff or online gamer then look for other alternatives.The following parameters can be used to judgeBuilt, Sturdiness and Durability  <U+25BA> 8/10Sound  Loudness and clarity (Listening to music)  <U+25BA> 9/10Sound  Loudness and clarity (Online Movies)  <U+25BA> 6/10Bass (Listening to music)  <U+25BA> 9/10Bass (Online movies)  <U+25BA> 4/10Voice Calling and Clarity  <U+25BA> 9/10Bluetooth Connectivity  <U+25BA>  9/10Audio Lag  <U+25BA> 500 msNoise Cancellation (Passive)  Listening to music  <U+25BA>  9/10Noise Cancellation (Passive)  Online movies  <U+25BA>  5/10Battery Backup  <U+25BA>  9/10Total Value for money  <U+25BA>  6/10  "
"18" "        I will write the cons first unlike others, because except these cons everything else are Pros.Cons:1) Music Lag will be there if you are watching any videos or music online2) Noise cancellation is not there, hence where you are in the outside environment then you would definitely hear the environment noise even if your headphone's volume is at max.3) This is horrible - Connection Drops occurs if you are wearing the headphones and doing cycling or biking or just moving somewhere on any vehicles - This is the ridiculous thing, don't know why it is occurring.If you are ok with the above negatives then you are good to go because as far as sound and music quality is concerned, this headphones are good.  "
"19" "        Sound bursts sometimes when playing through YouTube, its sound quality is good and bass is very heavy. But build quality is not good, ears start paining. It also doesn't connect with old feature button phones through Bluetooth. Overall it is an average product. I actually wanted a high end product, so i returned it back to amazon, thanks to very good refund policy of Amazon.  "
"20" "        I've ordered these headphones and been using them for around a month now. The sound quality is very nice and you'll enjoy it off you're a person who enjoys a bit of touch of extra bass. Frequency coverage is good as well. The material of headphones is good and cushion is very comfortable in the ears. Battery life is awesome and the description accurately mentioned the same. The Aux option is an added advantage for long journeys, though sound quality is better in Bluetooth mode. The only issue which I found was there was a delay of almost quarter to half a second in the audio when connected over Bluetooth. However this is observed in most of the headphones connecting over Bluetooth. I have tried Skullcandy Uproar headphones (for same price of 1999) and if I have to suggest someone, I'll definitely suggest boAt Rockerz 600  "
"21" "        The headphones are excellent. Sound quality is good. They've a long battery life. The bass is good for those who are not into extremely Lloyds music. The comfort is commendable. The noise cancellation is great as well. Allows you to get lost into your own world of music. It was packed with safety as a priority.  "
"22" "        I'll keep it simple and short.It's is best buy but 2 key features are missing though those not deal breaker in this price range.1- it does not have Bluetooth 4.1 hence you cannot connect multiple devices at once.2- No AptX codec support hence there is slight latency with audio while watching YouTube or video streaming. They went with generic SBC codec which not that good.Nevertheless it's good product under 2k price window.  "
"23" "        I am using it  since last year. No complains !! Aux cable is not durable though . i need to order another aux cable (https://www.amazon.in/Boat-Indestructible-Metallic-Plated-Connectors/dp/B01FVWLT9M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1531064429&sr=1-2&keywords=boat+aux&linkCode=ll1&tag=freembastuff-21&linkId=85ab41bfc73c5bfbbfe5ccf79cb7d646)  which works fine !!!!Also after one year, Bluetooth range is decreased.  "
"24" "        Let me confess, I was little apprehensive while making this purchase, but Glad to have it.After using it for more than a week now I can say about...Material Quality : A+ Gives a rich feel when you hold it, I haven’t dropped it (who does ??) so can’t say for its sturdiness but definitely a premium product.Sound Quality : A++ Clear sound with ‘0’ delay is what I was looking in my product and boAT meets your expectations just right.Battery Life : A++ First Day I plugged it to recharge for about 1.5 HR’s, since then I have not recharged it till last night. It says a lot about it.  "
"25" "        After 3 mothts of usage, i must say (prior to the problem I'm now facing) it is good. I used Phillips SHB4000 (Bluetooth headset), for 3 long years. The sound quality of boats is very good, even the build quality. However, after 3 months, the headset automatically switches off - sometimes within 10 seconds of connection or after a couple of minutes. Today it wasn't even getting connected to my device. Irrespective of the sound n build, what's the use if its not durable? I have raised a ticket with boats, will update my review upon their replies and service.  "
"26" "        I had purchased this product thru AMAZON on 29/04/2017The earphone was overall satisfactory but for last 4-5 months i am facing problem with the ear cups .The faux leather used for ear cups is not leather - its a cloth piece with coated leather dust which is simply horrible and plain cheatingAlthough all care was taken while using and storing. I have seen similar problem was raised by other buyers in amazon reviewA complaint has been raised in manufacturer website vide Ticket Number is 1052266 but a standard reply came to intimate that beyond warranty nothing can be done - further requests made for assistance in repairing remains unattended ( no further response)It seems that manufacturer knows it well that the product will last without any major problem at least till warranty period and in case some problem comes it  might have been taken care of, Beyond that they are least bothered to provide any after sales service which should be noted by all future buyers.How can such product and such manufacturer can be \" AMAZON CHOICE\" ???  "
"27" "        Really great headphone. Bought it on headphone zone.... Very happy with the sound quality. Perfect balance of mids, bass and treble. Ideal for all genres of music, and superb for hearing conversations. The battery life is amazing. Goes for weeks on end with minimal use. I can actually count the number of times I've recharged it in the last 6 odd months that I've owned. Very light on the ears and extremely comfortable. Highly recommended. This, the Avantree Audition Pro and the Portronics muffs Pro are probably the best in the segment. I own all three and all are superb.  "
"28" "        The first time i got these were before my 10th boards in 2016.These are just the best possible headphones you can buy for this price point. I have personally researched and used all th headphones possible in this price range...from jbl to sony... I have used all and these have none to beat them.Th bass & treble is just perfect....the vocals are good and the voice is decently loud.The noise cancellation is amazing & hence no outdoor use suggested.. Yes of course there are even better headphones out there but you also have to match their prices...so basically if you have a budget more than <U+20B9>4000....then I would suggest you to look for other one but otherwise go for these...These are amazing for the daily drivers....The battery is just amazing & for someone using them for around 20mins daily....it will last you around 20 days easily..The only con it has is its noise leakage issue...but otherwise they are just the best you can get for the price....the only other ones close to these are the rockerz 510...Btw bought these again last week (now before my 12th boards ;)  because one of the speakers of my old ones has stopped working....after heavy 2 years use though..  "
"29" "        Firstly,I have no complaints against this product whatsoever except for one thing. I was very disappointed on not finding the aux cable and the usb cable for charging as promised.The usb cable wont be an issue (every home with a smartphone has one) but aux cable is not readily avaialable ri8?.Now I have to spend a few bucks to buy an extra aux cable in case my battery runs out......come on boAt you did a fair job in making this great piece of headphone...havent used them much yet.........but ultimately failed after not being able to provide as advertised........hopefully as soon as this settles out I will update this comment to the review on the headphones ; )  "
"30" "        Review After Using Continue 15 Days ( max 4-5hrs a DDay).So what i think is BoAt RockerZ 600 is must go if you want crispy and clear sound.It has(brown one) more battery then the normal varient (black). Battery backup was quite good not to worry about batter backup if you buy brown colour varient.Charges in 2:35hrs (0-100%).Bass level is good, using BoAt 400 before buying this so so the first day i feel lass sound and bass compared to BoAt 600 that has vibration/thumping bass. But after continue usage of 4-5 days it feels like DJ. The bass is really good and has clear crispy sonuds. But i don't feel thumping/vibration bass like other ones (bludio). It has normal sound.Comfort is really cool, i can continue use it for 4-5 hrs without feeling any king of pain. But in BoAt 400 i can feel pain just after 30 mins of usage. Because of there hard leather cousin.It has cool stylish comfortable cousins not feeling any kind lf pain.Pros-HD clear crispy soundBattter backupNoise cancellationComfortDesignPocket friendlyCons-Feels less Bass (it could be better)Feels a little low sound(could be use high sound driver like bludio)  "
"31" "        I have purchased BoAt Rockerz 600 on 08-08-2019 for 1999 INR (Freedom sale offer)...Amazon's Delivery : 5/5The Product review as follows...Looks  :  5/5  - (Looks are subjective, one may like others may not),Sound Quality  :  4.5/5 - (good and could have done better, Always there is a room for improvement)Battery Life  :  5/5  - (10 Plus hrs)Bass  :  5/5  - (best in class)Price  :  4.5/5  - (Worth 2000/-, buy only on festive seasons)Connectivity  :  3.5/5  - (faced few issues in connectivity,I think most of Bluetooth devices have these issues)Noise Cancellation  :  4/5  - (could have done better)Build Quality  :  4/5  - (My only concern are the exposed wires from headphone which might get damaged)Controls  :  4/5  - (good and could have done better, There is always a room for improvement)Call Quality  :  5/5  - (Best in class)Video Playback  :  4/5  - (Very rarely I found there is a lag in video playback in system videos, for Youtube there is no lag ).Other Benefits  : There is Option for Aux cable connectivity, if your head phone battery drains then you can connect to Aux cable and enjoy the Music, (some other headphones don't provide this facility)Final Verdict : At this Price tag, I don't think there are other headphones which match these features and quality output.I Recommend this Product...!!!  "
"32" "        Nothing will be better than this review..totally honest.These headphones have really good sound, bass is awesome, treble is also good. Battery is good as mentioned but the reason for which I have given 3 stars is the confort. These are not comfortable at all. I you know the science, there is a clamping force which pressurize the headphones towards ears. This force should be adequate so that we can wear the headphones dor long hours. But in these headphones this force iz very high. You can't wear the headphones for more than 15 min. It hurts a lot to ears. The pain is like you will want to remove the headphones just after 10 min. I really liked everything in headphones but the pain is a lot, so in my opnion the comfort level is 0/5 and the rest of the headphone is 5/5.  "
"33" "        Well, the quality of sound is impressive but not good as compared to my previous JBL headphones.I am rating it just 1 star as we do not have any number below this. I am rating this because of the connectivity issue I am facing with the laptop. It keeps on loosing connection which makes the entire experience too bad and frustrating. You charge it full or come closer to the device, it will still skip the connection.Having thought of manufacturing error, I ordered a replacement, but the replaced piece too keep on disconnecting. So that means, there is some internal compatibility issue with their bluetooth. or they have used poor quality hardware.I am using high end gaming laptop with windows 10.It doesn't matter if you have a good quality sound or great build quality. If it disconnects, it doesn't deserve to be called as wireless.  "
"34" "        I'm writing this review after using it for 1 year.Pros  : The Sound quality of the headphone still remains as brand new and also the battery backup didn't diminished a bit.Bass is perfect for a music freak like me.Also the audio sync while watching videos have no delay .The bluetooth strength is ok .Voice calling is far better than boat rockers 400 and 510. Controlling buttons works normal even after 1 year of continuous use.Cons  : Ears pains a bit after using it for more than 3 hours.And the biggest and only thing made me angry is the material quality used on outside.You can see it from my pic.The colour and coating on the cusions started getting worn out after 3 months and completely showed it's threads and cloths on cusion after 6 months.Same with the headband.It looks like a weird street quality headphone only after 6 months of use.So I can't even think about using it outside my room.Customer support is zero.And the parts of the headphone like batteries or Cusions are not available in the market .I searched every single online and Retail shops.Concl  : If you are a musical ,Game, Movie Lover who is always staying in your room it's a perfect headphone for you.Take it outside and your prestige is gone pooff.  "
"35" "        It sounds great for the price point and it still works after a year of usage. A few of the negatives I wasn't aware of earlier (a) I wound up using it solely with the aux cable because the BT lag made it difficult to watch movies without shifting the audio a bit, (b) Audio drops to mono if you're using the microphone and (c) the initial leather covering came apart (owing to me dozing off while wearing them) after about three months of use and I had to get a makeshift cover for it.Despite that, its hard for me to go lower than a 4-star rating since it still sounds and works great though I'd probably not be repicking these when I'm in the market again.  "
"36" "        It is loud. Bass is damn good. No distortion of sound on full volume. I am just a normal music lover guy. Don't know much of technical (Mid ,high etc). Mic is good.  Did not faced any problem during calls. Overall sound quality is pretty good. I never heard of boat 600 before. My budget was 4k-5k.Just went to chroma to check JBLT55 and XB650. None of them can satisfy me. I checked boat 600. I was really impressed by the sound and overall feel. After 5 days ,again went to same showroom just me make sure last time before buying. Bought it on Amazon for 2250. Bang !!It is quite comparable to Sennheiser hd 202.  "

"38" "        Dude whether you're a heavy music lover (EDM LOVER) or a Arijit fan in both way boat satisfy your need you'll love thisSo without wasting time letme clear your doubts regarding this boat rockerz 600I've Boat rockerz 400 & now i upgrade with boat rockerz 600 both are really good in terms of sound quality , BASS,sound separation , rockerz 400 are little bit tight, i mean after using it for 1 hr your ears will start paining but yeah under 1500 i would say Rockerz 400 are ultimate headphones they provides you a snug fit design but all are good but i face a big problem in rockerz 400 , (my headband get broke but then i use a metallic scale a bend it and attached with it's broken band and believe me guys it becomes unbreakable) you can blindly go for itNow let's talk about my recently bought BOAT Rockerz 600Sound Quality :- mids -highs- lows all are perfect, sound separation is very well boat gives you a perfect sound quality as compare to JBL (above 5000/- ) boat rockerz 600 gives a tough competitionIf you're a previous user of boat and also if you ever used any Bluetooth headphones of any brand this will be your favorite one you'll never regret on boat products.BASS Quality :- as compare to rockerz 400 and rockerz 510 this will not gives you that headphones vibration but it provides you a better sound quality and Perfect Bass so that you can feel heavy sound with Crystal clear sound.Battery backup :- charging time 3hrs and playback time 20hr (as company said ) but you'll get around 18hrs definitely depending upon sound volume (approx 70% volume)Now the best thing i liked very much and most of you guys will go for it is it's build quality,you'll get stainless steel metal headband but Speaker frame is build of high quality plastic with brushed metallic finished side penals.Call Quality :- better than rockerz 400 you can use for calling but i personally don't like to use for calling because you'll not realize you voice drastically increase while talking over call and the side person sitting besides you really get disturbed .At last i would say if boat gives 20hr playback in it's black color version of Rockerz 600 this will be the perfect beast & best combination of sound with durability ......Thanks for reading my experience <U+263A><U+FE0F>My review will really help you for finding a best Bluetooth headphones and i hope i've cleared all your doubts  if you want to ask anything regarding boat rockerz 400 & rockerz 600 you can ask me on my Instagram account @aryanv343All my pleasure to help you out for selecting a best headphones.Stay safe <U+0001F91E>  "
"39" "        Not Able to hear anybody, I have purchased this on 25th March Gifting my wife, She did not use the Headset for call, whenever I call her through the headset her voice is very low as if she is in a tunnel and standing miles away. I thought she doesn't know how to use it. But I started using it from yesterday, I am able to listen to music, Not so bad but the mic is the worst I kept increasing volume of both my mobile and the headset not much difference.If only I could have returned the product when I could have, its too late I will file a complaint in the site to see if I get any help from them  "
"40" "        Boat rockerz600, like it's name really rocks and no complaints about the features of it. Extremely satisfied with this buy and a small information for the buyers who want to own this musical magic is that they buy the brown coloured one which is slightly priced above the black variant due to the battery back up of brown variant which is approximately 18 hours, which is a solid performance of the gadget in it's price range and some reputed companies like boat.  "
"41" "        Excellent product. I loved it so much. Very very fast delivery by Amazon. I got the product same day I ordered. Packaging was extraordinary. Very safe packaging. Now I will speak about Cons and pros .Pros:-1)  The bassThe bass is extraordinary. In love with this product. It has a very heavy bass. It's perfect for music and bass lovers. I have tested each and every headphone even Harman kardon as well but there is no comparison to this product. It's very light weight and foldable as well . It comes with pouch where u can keep this headphone and is very handy as well. It's quality as well as comfort is excellent . Noise cancellation ..... excellent .....wow .Cons:-The charging of the product is going upto 90 %only.The audio video synchronisation is a bit disappointing. If somebody loves to watch movies on the go they may get disappointed. As I am not having interest to watch movies on the go so it's not a problem for me  "
"42" "        I ordered this product for the 2nd time because the one I had got in the 1st time was defective as it's buttons were not at all responding.Below are the pros and cons of the 2nd one based in my usage experience of 2 daysPros:Sound Quality and look wise the product is just amazing. The Sound Quality you would get of any boat device and noise cancellation is also quite nice. Plus, it looks very cool on your head because of the metallic finish.Cons:Comfort; it is NOT comfortable as compared to the headphones of Sony or JBL (based on my experience as I have used them both). Your ears start feeling pressure and ache if you continuously put it on for 45 mins or more. Also, if you wear SPECTACLES/SUNGLASSES, it feels even more uncomfortable.When you put the earphones around your neck, it feels as if someone is holding your neck tight!Accessibility:It is literally a pain to switch on the BT of the headphones. I have to atleast try 6/7 times for switching on it's BT Everytime I have to connect with my phone unlike other BT headphones/earphones that switch on with just one click.I have rated it 3 stars only because of it's Sound Quality and looks. That's it!  "
"43" "        I'll tell you what, when they say premium they actually ruin the hardware quality..this device I specifically bought for enjoying music and for outdoor usage. But there are lots and lots of glitches..1st I couldn't get the battery performance of this device .. well till 50% battery life it's well and good and after that .. nothing.. collapses in some minutes of usage.The second and most irritating glitch that made me throw away this device was a mechanic noise that suddenly pops up. And can be undone only by reconnecting the device..The range is poor. At 10 feet there is desynchronization and sound lags completely..On comfort I would say it's a messed up piece of a device.. projections which are unnecessary and irritating are used..not comfortable.. tiring experience.Bass and sound is not up to the mark which would let you ignore the above factors.  "
"44" "        I have bought over 8 of these over the past 4 years... I like this headphone for a multiple reasons1. The headphone has soft cushioning and is easy on the ears... (I did not like boat rockers 400 as my ears hurt after 1 hr of usage)2.the headphone is foldable and looks good3. Good battery life.. It comes for a week with daily 2 hrs usage4. Incase the battery dies you can use an aux cableThe only negative is that it's not sweat proof.. So if I go running the headphone ear pads get wet and spoiled fast... I have put cloth earmuffs to counter that  "
"45" "        It's 17 months since I bought it, 3-aug-2017 to be precise. It comes with a 1-year warranty which I figured out later. Around nov-2018, 15 months since purchase, one side speaker failed. I looked up for some local electronics repair shops and authorised repair centres and lost couple of months there. Finally, I decided to contact boatstone directly, registered a complaint, promptly they replied too stating that the product was out of warranty. I called the number provided and was rather greeted impolitely and the rep stated the same warranty clause and hung up the call abruptly. So, bottomline INR 2k+ down the drain. That's the story.  "
"46" "        Not even worth 500 rs these wires got torn after few days use. Writing this review after over an year and a half so first of all the wires were broken a few days after use. Then to register it for warranty is an impossible task customer support not there no service centres. I got it repaired by a local shop a few days back. But the wires were so fragile that now the mic and other buttons not working the aux cable which came with it started giving problems within 2 days of use. Just by getting ur adds done by some actors and actresses doesn't make ur product good. Good customer support and good materials does.  "
"47" "        Quality is Excellent!!!  but I used it for 3 months and one right speaker isn't working and Now I don't understand, whom should i contact for repair.And i haven't used it since 2 months. Its waste to buy, why because they don't have service centers any where around hyderabad city  "
"48" "        1 The sound quality of this headphones is good but only only the people who listens to music and watches movies2 Bluetooth problem if you have phone in pocket Bluetooth will not work properly3 But if you want to use this for talking phone and playing games like pubg and others it is the worst one for you guys because it is always getting disconnected  "
"49" "        Fabulous product of Boat for sound loving people. I got it at cheaper price on Amazon sale & just loving it. It perfectly fits on the head and gives a clear & non disturbing smooth sound. The bass is high which I love most. Battery backup is also awesome. One thing which is negative point of Bluetooth earphones or headphones is synchronization problem with connected devices, but that too of a fraction of seconds which can be adjusted for this beautiful thing.Go for it without hesitating.  "
"50" "        Good quality audio and excellent battery life. The wire sticking out on the sides isn't aesthetic. And the blue flashing light is annoying at night when you use it in the dark. The material in head band is durable but gets dirty soon. Don't expect to use more than couple of hours max. Ears get all sweaty. Texture of the phones comfortable and grip is also fine.Not a big fan of the buttons.Long press for volume adjustment is plain stupid. It should have been by clicks. Single click skips the track to next one.Long term review:After one year of regular use at home and even during travel. I am glad to have owned this headset. The ear cushion deteriorates even when used with care. But it's a trade off for the study comfort. Wish Boat could sell the cushions seperately.I am buying the same one for my wife too. I find this to be of good value for its quality and price point. 4 star it is.  "
"51" "        bass is not very good....had to change settings in my phone to get more base.noise cancellation is poor...connectivity is better...i had skullcandey earphones its base was just amazing....and its cost was 1500..its performance was better than boat rockerz 600 especially in base and noice cancellationSO....IF YOU WANT A BETTER SOUND GO FOR THE HEADPHONES THAT SAYS SUPER EXTRA BASE...SO THAT WE GET THE EXPECTED BASE...base is not upto the mark...skullcandey's base is nice comparitively...  "
"52" "        If  you are looking for a good sound in just 2k, this is a perfect headphone for you. But the customer care is too unprofessional.In my case, they took away my existing headphones which purchased from Amazon and accepted my appeal for replacement last month but even today they did not care to ship the new piece.To conclude, fabulous headphone with bad/no customer support from the company.  "
"53" "        Product was good and sound is awesome initially.Bass is too good and passive noice cancellation works well.Coming to cons the sound lags while watching any videos via bluetooth and while connected through cable this lag disappears. But I have noticed that sound started to crackle and making some kind of hissing sound at times.Had replaced this headphones and testing the replaced piece currently. May be the sound problem doesn't arise in the new headphones hopefully.  "
"54" "        Soft cushions, square cups and a shade smaller for bigger ears, no extra cushions supplied.Lag in sound by a second or so when playing via BT, Bass is just OK. Tested with Samsung S6 and Lenovo Note8. Lenovo was louder than Samsung and higher volumes (not good for your ears) had a bit of jarring and lacked a bit of clarity, may be noise cancellation isn't effective. Mic is good and able to converse with clear sound.Battery seems ok but it's as per specs. At higher volumes didn't last more than 5.4 hours.Product is not great but ok and good to buy if it's less than 2k. Else wouldn't suggest. 4 star given as I got for 1999  "
"55" "        This review is after 2 weeks of use.Pro - Sound clarity and base is good considering its price range. Looks premiumCons- too hard to wear for more than 30 min.Check your box as I received two charging cable but no aux cableSecondly it starts beeping irritating noise once it hits below 20% battery and will automatically switch off once it hits 15%. You cannot control the same.Overall connectivity is good but not strong. If u just move from one room to other within raidus of 5 meter with door open, it will disconnect.Headphones made of single contact steel. If once disloged you will have no other choice than to buy new one.Overall value for money 15-1800. Not more than that.  "
"56" "        First let me tell you this is not a paid review or something like thatI bought this earphone way back in June 2018 and been using till today which is 28th Nov 2019 so I am an eligible guy to say some pros and cons about this headphonesPros:- 1) Very good quality sound with bass2) Built quality is good and feels premium3) Wireless + wired(in case your battery is dead)4) Very soft cushions which is a plus point if ur listening songs for hours5) Fits perfectly as earcups are adjustable6) Can Fit anywhere in your bag7) Battery backup is excellent7) Amazing deal in this price rangeCons:- 1) Cushions may last long for 9months - 1year if kept properly but if used roughly will last long max 7months then it will start to deteriorate2) Volume isn't too much provided as compared to JBL headphones3) Sometimes BT connectivity doesn't work properly4) not for gamers if ur playing on BT connectivity instead of AUX cable as there is sound delayVerdict :- after using it for more than 1.5 years I can recommend u to buy this pair of headphones if u have the budget of around 2.5kHope this review will helps...Regards,Ankit  "
"57" "        I saw a YouTube video of my review, bit I thought that person hot a defective piece but now even I am facing the same problem.While watching movie you will feel that sound is coming 1 to 2 seconds late.Similarly, while typing text message, tik tik sound of keyboard is delayed. It irritates when you are not typing and still you hear tik tik typing sound.Moreover, I thought this can be a good headphone while playing PUBG. But you will feel that firing sound comes later and very late. Very slow headphone guys.Although, if you just wanna hear songs, then buy it 100%. Sound quality is good.Also while talking to phone, the mike quality is very poor.Charging is amazing. It works like more than 6-7 hours continuesly and even more frankly.Comfort is amazing too.Everything except delay in sound is amazing... so if u can manage.. then go for it.  "
"58" "        I bought this on 18 Feb 2018. Hardly used it for over 1.5 yrs. Started to notice that the fake leather on the ear cuffs were starting to peel. Thought that was because it wasn't being used much and because of the moist air. Started using it more and it started to fall apart.Looks so premium when it was in good condition. Using it a little more and it's falling apart. What a shame.The sound quality is decent. There is a Bluetooth lag which is definitely not ideal for gaming.They are comfortable but might be a little tight.  "
"59" "        Sound quality is excellent good bass, crisp and clear. Best for music specially if u love EDM music and also if u play games on pc like Call of Duty, Far Cry or etc. Then u'll get excellent response.Pros:1. Light weight2. Excellent bass and clear sound/voice quality3. Small in size its easy to carry in single hand4. Very easy to pair with any bluetooth deviceCons:1. AUX cable quality is poor2. Audio delay in bluetooth mode3. U should always use aux cable mode with pc/laptop to avoid audio delayDidn't test the battery life yet and if u're preffer using via aux cable then pls buy or use some other aux cable because the output from included aux cable is not good.I hope this will help ;)  "
"60" "        I like the product. It is worth it's price tag. A quality products t from Boat. I love this trendy and superb headphone. Quite comfortable on my ears and good sound quality. You can go for it. Better sound quality than Boat Rockers 510 as I have both and I can clearly compare the quality. Spend a little more and go for it. You will never feel disappointed . Only one problem might be there and that is it's cushion which seems very weak and might get damaged very easily. Otherwise nice headphone.  "
"61" "        Great Headphones at this price..Pros..A really good build qualityBoom bassGreat sound qualityLooks really good.. also very compact..Mic quality is better then other boat headphonesCons..A little tight right now.. can't use more then a hourNo bluetooth 5.0..0.5 sec delay in sound while gaming and little delay in videos too but not so significant....I don't understand.. 400 had no sound delay in my OnePlus 7pro but 600 does have... There is no way 400 has something better hardware then this.. but latency is more in this one.. why?  "
"62" "        It's an awesome product. Best thing is it can be used both as wired or wireless. I didn't expect microphone would be that much good, but it beats my expectation and voice is clear in phone calls.Update:  After usage of 3 months, I observed that Bluetooth range is very small like 10 to 20 feet and that too in the line of sight only. It could be the biggest drawback if you want long distance Bluetooth connection between different rooms of the home.  "
"63" "        This is my first headphone (on the ears), just after 15 - 20 mins of usage, ears started paining. So far I have been using the earphones. At least I didn't find them comfortable on the ears. I returned and back to my ear-ins.Sound --> Really good 9/10Bass -->  Good  8/10Noise Cancellation  --> 8/10Build Quality  --> 7/10Comfort  --> 5/10 (At least for me)Value for Money  --> 8/10  "
"64" "        As you already readed in headline its small it doesnt fit me its so tight that hurts my ears for 1 hour after using it like for 20 minutes. Except this sound quality is awesome at this price range cant compare with high end but this is awesome and bass is too good you can buy tgis if your age is under 15 i think  "
"65" "        Super quality product....Sound and bass was outstanding..Aux cable also good quality..Prob is size is littile bit smaler..if ur wear it on neck u cant move ur head properly...#Buy brown 450mah battery and 20hr playback..#black only 300mah battery and 8hr playback....Worth for the money..  "
"66" "        Now,  this is basically a review of the product and the vendor both.  Product is good as far as music is concerned. but bluetooth drops and call quality is pathetic which only gets connected after several attempts of receiving the call. Also, the controls are a little messy.  Because of this I had to exchange my product. Note: i had asked for a replacement because of music quality.So now coming onto the vendor,  the replacement i got was a dirty box which i cleaned thinking it happens if the products are in a warehouse. Once i opened the box,  the headbands had visible fingerprints of mud and also FUNGUS.  And when i spoke to amazon, they said that they are sorry and they can refund the amount. I mean, where is complaint resolution of the kind of product i received. Obviously you will refund the amount,  but what is the action being taken in this regard,  none is telling.  "
"67" "        Sound quality is good if you listen to 320kbps songs else it gets little distortion in sound which is negligeble if you listen to 50-60%volume. Premium quality made of. Good packaging. Noise cancellation is good but not great. Keeps beeping after 10-15 second if battery comes to 20% . And after reaching down 20% it took about 5 minutes to get zero. Playing time i got about 16hr in a full charge and in full volume. Wire up function is useful when battery dies. Has a great amount of base. If you love to hear rock/edm it's the best for you. High and mids are good. But not as good as lows. Overall I think it's value for money. I'm writing this review after using it for 5 days. I'll change it in future if it gives any unsatisfying things  "
"68" "        The product is overall quite good..The sound quality is fantastic especially at this price, The only issue i got with this headphone is the outer cover that started tearing off within few weeks of use... I used the headphone for few years using adessive tape as the sound quality was brilliant.Finally the tape could not hold the outer black cover and the sponge within and i had to throw the headphone.. But i must say that it was working till the point i threw... Had no other issue than this...Yes i definitely recommend this product as I feel my unit could have a manufacturing defect.ThanksYougal Lakhani  "
"69" "        I’m a long time collector of quality headphones. I’ve used Shure, Sennheiser, Bose headphones in the 10-15 thousand price range category. Several other brands in the 4-7k category over the past decade.This headphone ,has a sound signature that’s stunning for the price it is coming with. In a blindfold test - any experienced reviewer would  place it in the 7-12K price bracket.That’s how much good it is.I cannot really fault it for anything - be it the lesser than premium foam padding or the slightly tight fit- as compromises have to made for a sub 2K wireless headphone.No compromises with the sound , though.  "
"70" "        Being an audiophile.  I think i can give you right review.I'm a fan of boat, own 240 ,225 bassheads, I'm writing this on the basis of bluetooth modeOn wired mode the quality is strictly depends on the device you're using.  In wired mode they do a okay job on my phone but I'm able to get a real sound experience on my laptop by tweaking the volume.Pros1-Bass- the bass is good and thumping it can meet up your expectations of bass.2-Comfertable- Im a earphones kind of guy haven't used much headphones, but these are most comfortable I've ever come across. ( the center portion is hollow, the foam padding is just around the earcups but overall it distribut the pressure all over the ear as the result you don't feel any pain for certain amount of time. )3- Built quality is good but that wire on top of each earcup is not fabric coated and doesn't give confident for rough use.4- Bettery Backup - I've purchased the brown one so I'd got 450 mah bettery which is great.Cons1-Overall sound quality - The greatest con here is it's sound quality.  It provides good amount of bass but lacks a lot treble. I'd really had to Focus hard to notice some background instruments.Musics like Bollywoods, classics, EDMs lose thier crispness and impact . Sound is not powerful at all, you can't really tell the difference between tones. The vocals are good but not that great either.It softens the sound signature of all music genres and boost the bass a bit , so if you're interested in party songs,  raps etc go for them,  but if you appreciate  music more than bass,  than they might disappoint you. We might find highs a bit clear because it can't reach higher frequencies.2 -Loudness - these aren't quiet but not enough loud at same time,  if they were a vit more load then i think they might provide good sound experience and clarity.3- Passive isolation - This don't work at all.Final verdictMy friends and cousins are happy with sound quality but I'm notMy boat bassheads 240 provide a way better listening experience then themWhile 240 are wired and powerd by device and 600 were bluetooth so their own bettery powerd.Thsy didn't match my expectations besides though i didn't have much.And now I'm requesting for a refund for 600.  "
"71" "        The on/off button didn't work. Worked randomly sometimes. Most of the  time it didn't work. Had to struggle  to turn the headphone on. It turned on sometimes. After it has turned on if I test it by turning it on and off repeatedly it worked fine. But if I leave the headphones off for a long time and try to turn it back on it wouldn't turn on at all. The sound quality was okayish. The headphone wouldn't turn on an I received it. Charged it for 3 hours before it would even turn on. I had problems with the on/off button. Wouldn't respond when I held it down to turn it on. Had to return it. Expecting replacement. Will update review after I receive replacement.  "
"72" "        I'm revising this product after Monthssss of using it.Had been looking for a headphone set for so long for the gym and I couldn't be more happy with the choice I made. These headphones are bang on everything I need for working out. Noise cancelling. Lightweight. Easy calling. Sweatproof.Good battery life. Good looking.Portable. Not a great Bluetooth range but good enough for the gym.It's kinda like an ideal investment for gym goers who need music for all that focus.If you're planning to invest in a headpone set not for the gym also, that's are amazing for regular use as well. For its price range, I think this is one of the best buys.  "
"73" "        A very good looking product. Its really loud so I use it on the lower side of the volume range. I originally bought it to pair with my LG tv but unfortunately it doesn't get discovered by it.So now I have resorted to use it with my laptop and mobile.The button on the headphones need work. It could been better.  "
"74" "        This product is very nice with sound and quality wise.You can use this product with wire and Bluetooth as well.Battery backup is around 6+ hours.Bluetooth connectivity is 5-10 meter.Bass is very nice.Little heavy but comfortable.Leather and headband,ear forms all are good.Charging is faster.Packaging is good.No support available from the Boat company.3.5mm wire quality is not good.Changing cable is also ok ok.Noise cancelation is not good.  "
"75" "        Things that stand out:1. One of the best budget headphones in the wireless segment.2. Noise filter works really well, while playing songs.3. Punchy Bass. Trendy Look. Light on head.4. Even at the higher levels of sound, it doesn't spill sound outside.Things to keep in mind:1. The brown colour ones have double the battery backup compared to the black ones, despite the price being same.2. Experiment a little with the phone equaliser to get the best output setting for different categories of songs.3. Go for the 320kbps versions of the songs, to get the best experience.Can't ask for more in this price range.  "
"76" "        It is 3 days from the purchase and product seems to be fine so far..sound quality is as good as expected...I am not able to make the voice full so far as it has enough sound that suits your ear..Battery so far has not created any issues but there are some bluethooth connectivity issue which I think is bcoz of low battery...Although, price can be little lower as compared to other brands..  "
"77" "        You couldn't ask for more. I'm writing this review after an year of heavy usage. That means, I've used this set while on my treadmill, while jogging, editing videos. There's not even a percentage Decrease in it's Sound Quality. The Bass is The Show Stealer! No compromise in its build quality. Battery Life is the Best. One charge and It lasts long enough. Chuck any other brand and go for Boat Rockerz 600. You won't ever regret it!  "
"78" "        Evrything is excelleny from audio qaulity to controls to build to base but only *1 con*If you wear for long hours thn it can cause neck pain bcz its slighlty on the heavier side but its is still lighter than those of the jbl or senhiesser headphones for professional use.Overall its good for daily use and regular use but strictly not for proffessional use bcz the lows are not tht great.  "
"79" "        .Cheapest sennheisur gives better sound quality than this...  I didn't know that baot is selling CHINA MAAL to Indians in the name of indian brand.Shame on you boat.My bad luck that I did not see that there is no return for this..Ear start painting in 15 minutes.No pouch received .Seal was opened.Somebody help me returning it.  "
"80" "        It might look really comfortable at first but after a couple of time you use it, you'll realise that the cushions aren't that comfortable and you may wear it max to max for 3-4 hours. Battery life is excellent. The look is brilliant. BUT. 1. It doesn't cancel out external noise completely  and 2. There is noise/sound leak. So don't play it too loud if you don't want people around you to know what you're listening to. The sound quality also changes when you put the aux cable (thumbs down for that). It's a decent bargain for 2k.  "
"81" "        I have purchased this product on 3 of may 2019 and on 17 of may i have register a complaint. below are the points which i am facing .i have also placed the image of the tracking number so that any one can check the status and process.1. Automatic switch off.2. Audio just garbles and change to weird noise .3. Customer care number on the box is wrong.4. I have Called to the customer care, after 5 min i received a message from customer executives they are busy we will call you later till now i have not received any call.5. I have mailed them to know the status multiple times but till now no response.6, Today (05.06.2019) i received my headphone , but box and accessories are still missing.again i raise a complaint .Hope this will help you to buy the product.Thanks.  "
"82" "        I I'm writing this review after using one month, product is very nice and good looking not very premium but ok ok.sound quality  4.6/5Bass quality  5/5Bluetooth connectivity 4/5Battery:.  4.5/5Stress on ear after 2 to 3 hrs is very lessFrequency range is good so you can hear small playing instruments in song while listingCons :Battery status is the only problem I have seen otherwise the product is good for those who want to purchase in the range 2000 rup in this range you will get good quality product.Advise: if during the purchase you compare with top brands in the low range so don't go for them you will get low quality may be your product life will be bigger but in reality you will use the product up to max 1 year so it is better to go for sound quality same thing I applied in this product now I m happy to buy this.

"83" "        Go for it if you do not use mic much. Headphones are amazing, great sound quality and bass and the most important they are very comfortable you can literally wear them for long time. Battery life is nice 15-16 hours. But the main problem is the mic, if you are in a crowded area like in the metro mic pickup unnecessary sound and doesn't work clear enough. Aside from that great headphones.  "
"84" "        Hi people,Purchased on 3 march,As of now 9 months.Used the product activity, while dancing, while working out, travelling, watching movies.Avg 5hours per day.Never thought the product will last this long with this good quality.Sound quality bass quality is great for this price range.Yes there is a large in sound when wireless ly connected, but can be avoided when connected through aux cable. Wired and wireless feature is so usefull.The ear gets feeling unconfortable after 1 hour of continues usage.But build quality is great.One small problem is that it absorbs the sweat from your head <U+0001F615>Battery life is also great and it charges very quickly.Mic is also good. But when connected through aux I feel small intermetent issues. But while wireless it's good.And thank you boat for this great product at this range.  "
"85" "        pros :bass, battery backup, build quality( metal hinge will enhance its life.)cons:sometimes out of nowhere the sounds start to crack. i pause and play it again, the sound becomes normal.the audio clarity with my mi phone is average with Bluetooth, excellent with 3.5mm jack.i have also observed audio quality varies with the phone.  "
"86" "        I bought this product in Jul18. It worked very well till a week ago. I use it in office so my use is quite sparse and never for music. All of the sudden, the headphone has stopped charging. As soon as I plug in the charger, the red light disappears within a minute and it does not charge. V disappointed given that the product really has seen minimum wear and tear.  "
"87" "        Using it for more than one year now , so i think that i am in better position now to review this , Sound quality is good , pretty much clear , smooth , crystal clear . Do not expect to much from bass  (for edm listners ) but i surely didnt get dissapointed . Now heres the catch its built quality , i am pretty much dissapointed by it , After one year now it started torn apart i mean the ear cusion , it started to coming out, acg quality cusion , plus that rod like thing which enable it to fold doesnt look good , it looks weird when u put on it i mean alien or frankestein like , not look classy or cool like other headphone .So overall if you want quality sound only with optimum bass avg user (not heavy) didnt care about it looks you can go for it.  "
"88" "        I don't recommend this headphones,you can see how the paddings got tear apart,at the 8 month only the paddings started to give up,It's totally waste of money,as they even don't mind to provide the cushions,worst cushions materials,i have been using the JBL head phones and they are holding it good and can take them out for tours but not this one.If you buy a product it should last some time,it started losing up at 8 months ,so bad,it's been late for my review but it at least matters for some people  "
"89" "        I buy this at Rs. 2,000 here. Mind blowing headphone and it is best headphone bcoz it fit in my head so tight and well soft cusion comfort my ears.and looking stunning in reality. Superb bass and sound like 10,000 rupees sound system much better than sony .  "
"90" "        Cons1.You cannot wear it beyond 30 minutes.You will feel that your head is being pressed from both sides by the headphone.2.The headphone would look premium initially.But over months the leather on the earpads will wear off.3.The headphone is not for normal people who  know have no knowledge on surround sound,highs,low ,mids and audio related jargons like me.Some songs on YouTube get played only on earpiece (left/right)/at a a time.The status if my headphone after a year of mild usage is attached  "
"91" "        Got a used or refurbished product when ordered the package was open.The build and material quality is ok and its comfort is also decent.The sound was all over, it was mixing , it was not good to hear at all the beat was off balanceOrdered this after seeing the decent reviewMaybe the product was a faulty oneThis review was based on the opened package which was delivered to me , also i returned it .  "
"92" "        The audio quality is really awesome. I am using it almost nine months till there is no problem. You can really feel sound bits because it stuck directly to ears.Go for it blindly instead of highly priced branded headphones.Cons: Comfortable for ears but not after long hrs it may affect your ears due to used of cushioned.  "
"93" "        it is an great product I didn't feel any kind of problem, i didn't suffered from any kind of sound breakage or lagging my phone is poco f1 with Bluetooth 5.0 version , but it is quite tight which will be loose after sometime of usage ,its leather is good but you have to take kare of it you have to keep it away from oil,water,steam,or any kind of material which can damage it ,its bass and sound quality is amazing,it is quite small from picture but enough ato cover your ears ,its cussion or pads removable which can be obtained from any boat store nearby you ,at last it is an good product overall and you should buy this brown colour varient because in that you will get 450 mah battery and in black you will get 300mah battery but if you will buy black then you have to not worry about your oil because black colour will hide that dirt .  "
"94" "        Ticks many of boxes...on  High volume bass, just vibrates the ear lobes, radiates to temporals and mastoids... Awwwsum crisp clear sound, battery back up outstanding... Ear cushions comfortable..Cons: audio video dissociation by 1 sec in you tube.Cannot operate buttons on head phones when connected with AUX cable. Cannot connect to two blue tooth devices at one go.  "
"95" "        Bought this item last week. I wanted to use it with my Bravia TV and for phone calls. Unfortunately it didn''t work out for either purpose. It fails to pair with the TV (it's the TV's fault), and when using for calls the other party reports the mic volume to be extremely low, along with other issues such as echo. Basically unable to use it for phone calls due to this reason. Still rating as 3 star as the sound quality is good.  "
"96" "        3.5 out of 5First of all sound quality is lovely,  bass is powerful,  mid , hi and lows are balanced .  Sound will not disappoint you.Secondly its a comfortable one,  hours and hours you can put it on,  padding and cushion are comfortingThird Bluetooth connect expirence is ok ok,  why?  Because when Bluetooth to wired switching happens and when you switch back from wired to Bluetooth,  then you'll feel and experience a situation of no sound response over the headset.Fourth when on Bluetooth you connected to instagram on mobile and to laptop, watching videos, you'll expirence a lag by 2-3 sec of mismtach in output of audio and video.Fifth battery life is good decent,  not to worry you've a wire to connect.Sixth Build quality is satisfactory.  Loved it,  touch and weight is sturdy.  "
"97" "        Pros:1. Perfect sound quality, no matter how much you increase the volume it'll not crack2. Perfect battery life, sometimes I leave it like that and still, the battery goes on.Cons:1. Bluetooth connectivity is a little disturbing.2. You've to increase the volume to fullest to cancel the noise from outside(people can hear little bit what you listening)3. It pains somewhat after you listen with it on for 2-3 hours.4. Audio lags a little bit as compared to the video.5. Not sweat proof.Besides having so many cons I still love these headphones because of 360 sound quality and awesome battery life.  "
"98" "        It's sound quality great but it's have one disadvantage when you're connecte to laptop and watching movies or any video then voice is mismatch so that it's feels bad when watching lectures or videos in laptop.I don't know why it's happening while everything is great except this problem.I buying that product three times but I got same problems.And another disadvantage is it's Bluetooth connectivity not very well and distance is not well.I hope this feedback helps to you for buying that product.  "
"99" "        The question is how long should this product last.I think a product should last atleast 5 years.This headphone gave away in 2 years time. I can go and buy it again for the nice sound, but such products in general are bad for the environment.Where should I throw the one that I bought 2 years ago. The cushion is torn and needs to be replaced.There are no spare parts available on the website as well.Now I know why people prefer a bit expensive products, they are supposed to last at least 10 years.  "
"100" "        I’m not an audio buff, so won’t comment on the output; the sound quality is, however, good for me. I was happily surprised with the build quality when I unboxed it, the use of soft material on the headliner is top notch. You’ll have to get used to using the play/volume controls on the headphone as these are not buttons. Seamlessly pairs with iPhone & iPad. Battery lasts long & the best part is that even if it drains completely, use can use an aux cable (in the package) to continue listening music. It’s compact too, so easy to carry. The connectors do feel fragile initially, but I’ve started to rely on them. It’s been around 4-5 months that I’ve been using these &, I believe, it was a good purchase.  "
"101" "        I have been using these head phones for three four months now and I can say I reall liked the built quality of this headphone sound quality is ok if battrey dies you have the option to use two sided male stereo pin wire 3.5mm so music never dies on this head phone you can pick calls and answer them mic quality is good over all worth for the price I am satisfied.  "
"102" "        I've been using since 2 months, battery is quite good i use 1.5 hrs in the mrng & 1.5hrs in the evening while travelling. I charge once every 4,5 days. But when battery is 40 percent it drains to 0 percent quickly in 1 hr. Next build quality is good, looks premium as well. These are so comfortable and you barely feel pain on ears. Sound is crystal clear with, you get full bass without compromising highs and mids. If you're thinking to buy rockerz 400, get these, these are comfortable & the there's huge difference in sound output.  "
"103" "        No doubt this is one of the best Bluetooth headset. But very comfortable on ears...unlike is rockerz 400, mic also good ..I got frustrated with Rockerz 400 as it hurting ears as I have specs so due to tightness.. always I feel uncomfortable..after seeing reviews about Rockerz 600 I decided to buy it...so now I am happy.. awesome sound quality and comfort... Only complaint is the adjustable plats are out side.  "
"104" "        Cheated not supported alexa.Very poor boat product and very pathetic amazon service regarding this product misguiding the customer regarding product features and not responding to customer in right action.plz dont buy any boat product from amozon because both are making fool of customer.  "
"105" "        Been using the product for 6 months now. Product & sound quantity is excellent. The only cons are:1) Sound lag while playing games/watching movies online in wireless mode. So have to be wired then.2) Uncomfortable for long hours of gaming. If you want one for this purpose, go for an over-ear headphone not on-ear.Except this, the product is excellent & the best in class. Go get it!!  "
"106" "        Best Luxurious Sound. I have used many headsets and wireless ones... like boat, JBL, OnePlus, samsung, The Sound in this model rockerz 600 is so smooth and he'll lot of luxury.. what you actually call crystal sound quality. Well. and Recommended. <U+0001F60D>  "
"107" "        Please go for it if you are music lover. I have been using it since many years.Pros:1. Good battery life. More than 15 days when used regularly.2. Great confirm.3. Best music experienceCons:Leather gets torn over the year. It releases leather particles after using a year.  "
"108" "        This was my perfect buy after a long time ... best headphones that I could get .... I not much into high end music but the audio quality of this headphones is much better than most of the headphones in its price range ... I bought it for 2000 bucks and it's complete value for money ... I have tested other headphones before buying this one and many of my friends have also bought it later on ...Plus point is the Aux support due to which you can even use it when you run out of headphone battery...  "
"109" "        The best value for money product. The sound ks pretty clean and crisp and the bass is super cool. The battery life is just beyond expectations and the bulit quality is exactly the same as mentioned. The looks are superior and are very comfortable on ears.The best thing about it I loved is the sound it is made for every kind of music. Even the mic is good and sensitive. The buttons are neat and easy to assess when used. Even the range of Bluetooth is good enough.  "
"110" "        The mids are not very clear. Sound engineer must pay attention to this.Secondly and most importantly the sound delivery of any headphone is much dependent on the headband. If the headband is too tight, the sound delivery and the impact is compromised. Headband of these headphones have too much of tension built it which gives the listener a very tightened grip on the head and on the ears. Designer has paid all attention towards the leather finish and royalism but the basics of headphone desigining is lost.  "
"111" "        10 months back I bought this product with a hope that I am getting decent headset but it came out beyond my expectation. Since then I have been recommended this set to all colleagues. However, the rise in price has amazed me completely. I bought it for 1750 from Amazon and now they are being sold for 2700+. Not sure if they have updated it but this rise makes me rethink about getting one more.  "
"112" "        Audio lag in Bluetooth is almost a deal breaker. What the hell was Boat thinking, making a Bluetooth headphone but audio is constantly lagging?! I'm using this wired which fixes the problem. Sound quality is almost excellent though. Material quality is posh. But the audio lag is just sad. It's much more noticeable on pc/laptop.  "
"113" "        Best headphones in this range.. Battery backup in unexpectedly awesome.. Good bass and everything.. Go for it.. I'm talking about brown onesEdit:now reviewing it again after 1 year and 3 monthPros:Battery life(brown) , bass, comfort, durabilityCons :i didn't found any since i have been using it for a long time on day to day basis... Best in segment  "
"114" "        Got the Boat Rockers 600 for <U+20B9>2099 in October 2018 and I have been using it almost daily ever since.Sound : Good bass, very decent sound ranging from low to high notes (but stress is ofcourse on bass)and most importantly no cracking of music.Noise Cancellation: Not complete noise cancellation, but when music is on it fairly manages this part.Comfort : Cent per cent score on comfort, ear doesn't pain due to the cushion no matter how long you listen.Overall : Its build, design, Bluetooth mic fairs well. Music is good.Its price is very less compared to other brands like JBL, Senheiser etc.Comfort wise one of the best.So definitely a recommended purchase.  "
"115" "        I ve been using it for more than 3 months now...the sound quality is still the same as before...Bt other things are not good...it's mic isn't working for 2 weeks...I cannot make calls...and while watching videos there are sound glitches quite often...which won't go unless you pause the video for 2-3 seconds...its range is low...like 3-4 metres only...then it starts to lag...it's sound quality is better wireless than wired...except that it's battery health is good..and bass is still the best part....Bt since I cannot make calls with this on..it really upsets me....  "
"116" "        I am reviewing it after 2 months only to give true opinion and do urge everyone to buy it if you are looking for a true sound Bluetooth headset. Bass is punchy and it is not empowering though there is marginal sound delay in some videos which is unnoticeable. Build quality is top notch and looks premium. A must buy product.  "
"117" "        There is already a lot about the Sound in the reviews. There is no doubt that the sound is off excellent quality, but the build itself is a con. My ear cushions are completely ruptured despite of taking maximum care. And the worst part is that there is no response from the customer care when I raised this concern(both phone and the email).I have also highlighted the fact that I am willing to pay for the repair/replacement of the ear cushions.  "
"118" "        It is painful to switch then on. Just can't seem to be able to do it. Need to try at least 15/20 times, before they will switch on. Good when they work. Return window closed. Will try to use them for a few more days otherwise out of the window...  "
"119" "        Sound quality - really good.Battery - enough for a long journey of around 10 hrsIf overall usage expectation is for a year or at max 2 then it's really a nice product!But because of average material quality, after an year the headphone ear cushions are loosing colored coating and also getting teared. So BOAT should either improve material quality of ear cushions or should make it available for replacing those.  "
"120" "        Best headphones for wireless and wired use.Not giving headache if you listens for long time.Best puffy cushions for more comfort. Moreover Made in India.By and Indian brand.Be Indian buy Indian. Prous to be Indian  "
"121" "        Its sound quality is good bass is also nice. battery life is great . Noise cancellation is decent. Bluetooth connectivity is good in indoor but \"worst\" at outdoors I am not able to listen to song even when i put my phone in my pocket and totally not for running or jogging as the headband has kind of become loose and also the right ear buttons are loose and make rattling sound. The faux leather has kinda started ripping off from my right earcup and the headband has also started damaging. the mic works great while connected with bluetooth but when connected with aux cable the other person is not able to hear clearly and you have to remove your headphones to talk. It also feels like it has 1sec delay while watching movies which makes the movie experience really bad. Although the sound quality is nice and i am pretty much satisfied.  "
"122" "        1. I like the cushion makes it comfort to wear for long time,2. easily adjustable very adaptive to the ear and head shape3. Bass effect, sound quality is really very good comparitively to other popular brands which is more costlier than this one. so obviously cost effective4. 3 classic different colors available5. Battery life is appreciable.6. Light in weight.Needs to improve1. Little bit more stretch need to wear in neck2. Bluetooth is good but sometimes I experience this connection lost even when phone is nearer.3.Headband size should be reduced further in my point of view.  "
"123" "        Everything is good untill you use it for a 1 month or two but the issues starts after that i bought this last year in the month of october and I had to send it thrice to the service centre  and still my issue wasn't solved. So please go for something else I don't think it's worth the price you pay for and it doesn't even works properly for a year.. And even if you send it to the service centre it takes 20-25 days to get resolved with no gurantee that your issue was resolved coz all the three time i have faced the same issue. Boat you should take care of it like you are charging this much still the device doesn't works properly..  "
"124" "        expected a good quality headphone from boat.totally disappointed. It works fine in wired mode but  in wireless mode starts crackling as soon as you forward/seek in video or music.have to use it as wired). And after giving it for service during warranty period they neatly packed the same piece and sent me again.Its not comfortable for ear also.Total waste and regret my decision 1 year up  "
"125" "        There is a lot to talk about this headet mainly this is thebest sounding headset for the budgetHas amazing bassStylishThe drivers on this is just amazingThe main problem about this is it has a time delay of 1 second so it's not a great choice for video watching wirelessly but it is a great choice for music. When plugged via the jack the problem goes awayAnother thing is this is just not suitable for long listening after a while your ears start to pain.Other than these the headphones sound amazing,sturdy build quality,amazing bass.Just perfect for music.  "
"126" "        this is the best headphone in this price budget and also have a decent quality and it quite comfortable but only thing i feel bad about this headphone is that after using it tor 1 hour my ears started to hurt a bit and after that u can not use it its like someone is pinching u constantly so if u r looking for headphone using it continuously for 2 to 3 hours u should not buy it but if u use it lightly like for 40 minutes or 50 minutes continuously then its good to go.  "
"127" "        Very poor .I bought this because of YouTube reviews.Cons:Worst Bluetooth connectivitySound quality is not good at 70 percentage above volume.2-4 second lag of audio with videoIf u put for 4 hours charging also it will be 90 percentageProsComfortable to wear initial 5 days will be issue,we will feel ear pain after that okMaterial quality is goodSo as per my suggestion don't buy this guy's I donno what to do with mine I cannot return also.  "
"128" "        Best brand in audio systemss..F&d and boAtTrust meI am using boAt rockers 400 as well fron last 3 years, still working same as a new one,Wonderful product,Best Brand,I gifted it to my uncle,he is in u.k. he also love this one....  "
"129" "        Worst product. They don't mention that mic will never work. We just don't buy this product for listening song instead thought of taking calls too. But mic quality is worst. No one will be able to hear on the other side of phone untill we remove the headphones connectivity. Also no return options here only exchange. I tried exchange and check my luck with another piece and that one also the same. Guys please don't buy this product many other options are there in much less price of this.  "
"130" "        Just a single word to define this headphone \"BEAST\". There is little bit of delay in sound, but it will not effect if you are only listening to music, but it make video watching little bit difficult but it can considered under this price.For better bass and treble I would recommend to use Poweramp app. It is available for only 99 rupees with lifetime subscription.And while using this app keep headphone volume to maximum and volume in mobile from 50% to 56%, for best experience.  "
"131" "        Excellent on ear headphone. The headphone is quite comfortable for long hours but your ears may start getting warned up and sweaty for really long hours of wear. The battery backup is around 5 to 6 hours. The bass is also quite good.  "
"132" "        I was looking for JBL initially but the reviews made me inclined towards boatz. With doubts I ordered it but I am delighted to have it. Fantastic looks, Wonderful sound clarity with great bass. Never had such sound ever. I bet you won't get this quality in 2000 rupees.  "
"133" "        Its been a few weeks since I used this product. Overall, I don't regret buying this. Great sound and bass and most importantly, its value for money. I'm also pretty happy with the build quality as well.The only downside I feel is the range of its bluetooth. The sound just cuts out if you put it in a bag or keep it anywhere aside which normally should not happen with other bluetooth headphones.  "
"134" "        ProSound quality  is good while using wireless.Charging capacity  is average.Body is good quality metal.ConsWhile body is metal but cloth  attached with it are poor.Provided wire that connect device and headphone is very poor quality  "
"135" "        Sound quality is excellent. This is my second rockerz 600.The leatherette cover of earpads was torn off from my earlier one and there is no replacement available for the same.I tried other headphones as well as earpods but didn't found anyone like this.Improvement: it should be upgraded to Bluetooth 5.0  "
"136" "        The headphones are stylish and the sound quality is very good. There are problems with the Bluetooth connection sometimes as the sound gets distorted and has to be paired once again. Another problem is that it feels a lot tight. Otherwise the set is great  "
"137" "        Don't have to go into detail as this is already an established product. Awesome battery, great comfort, superb bass and unique looks. The only thing lacking is color optionsAwesome product, just buy it. It's been exactly a year that I've used it and it still plays like new. Looking at mine, a colleague also bought it and he's happy too.Amazon packaging and delivery was good.  "
"138" "        Writing after an year of satisfactory usage.I have a major issue with durability of headphones. My last Apple earpods could not last long inspite of my best effort. But this one is sturdy. It is flexible enough to not break when I throw it in my bagpack with a dozen other miscellaneous stuff.Audio quality is satisfactory. Loud enough to be useful in busy traffic.Most importantly this product has such a long lasting battery that you would never need an aux cable. I go weeks without charging it.These are also perhaps the prettiest bluetooth headphones in this range.If I have to add cons- mic is not satisfactory, although I am lately relying on it. The on-ear design is not the most comfortable, makes you sweat during heavy workouts. You can at most use it 3 hours at a stretch. Similarly priced Sony ones are very comfortable, but those will be wired, and sound worse than Boat. Lastly, the material tends to progressively get tacky, and not being plastic, it can't be cleaned.  "
"139" "        Fairly good product with rich bass but the battery went bad well just out of warranty period of 12 months. Battery does not even last 2-3 mins even after charging for hours.Called up the local service center and customer care to know that they don't service this model meaning they don't service it all and they wont replace it since it is warranty. So my handset is now a piece of trash in 13 months.  "
"140" "        The sound quality and all is good as mentioned but these headphones are even more uncomfortable than boat rockerz 400. I bought these pair after by boat rockerz 400 headset broke and I heard the review that the earpads have cushion and they are very comfortable, but it's not at all comfortable can't wear them for more than 10 minutes it becomes too tight. No benefit of good sound quality as you are constantly feeling the pressure on ur ear and near the temple area.  "
"141" "        If you watch video continually over Bluetooth more than half an hour there are noise glitches. With wired there are no glitches. Again you need to restart the video. I don't know whether is it headphones issue or VLC player issue. But I raised replacement order for same.  "
"142" "        There is a bluetooth issue with this product. If you are a movie lover and want to watch movies with bluetooth on this headset then I don't recommend you buying this. That's because of the audio delay. While watching any video you will be noticing the lip sync doesn't match the audio which will ruin your experience. However you can use the aux cable for better quality. Boat rockerz 400 which costs around 1500/- is better while considering this issue. Rather than this issue, the material quality and battery life are excellent and you feel so comfortable wearing this. One more thing I forgot to mention is the packaging. This is the worst packaging I got from amazon. The seals of the box were open and the box was crushed. There was no bubble wrap around it. Never expected delivery from amazon. They did the same for my boat rockerz 400 which I bought last year.  "
"143" "        no need to go for costly headphones. this is 'on ear' headphone but cancel noise effectively and sound really boom. clarity of sound is awesome like earphone and comfort is like over ear headphone. Go for it blindly.  "
"144" "        Its a very good product. The sound quality is really awesome and very user friendly in navigating through the controls. The bass effect is rocking and unbelievable. Worth price under 5k. I love it. The voice are very clear in calls and it looks very stylish,easy to fold.ConsEar is paining after 30 mins of usage,  but I think it's usual with every headphones.  "
"145" "        Amazing product astonishingly comfortableThis product doesn't just looks stylish but the sound quality is beyond clear....(under budget) and the product (in my case) connects within fraction of secondsThe range is pretty reasonable like 10-12 feet around and the only con I was able to find was noise cancellationDoesn't clear sound mostly at all but when music is on it clears considerable amount of noise from aroundOverall best pick in boat as well as budget range  "
"146" "        Everything is awesome! Just one problem is sometimes the sound lags when a video is played and you can really get disappointed on that thing. The reason for the lag is low battery on either headphone or the laptop/mobile generally. If that is not the reason, then you might look to replace it after thorough check-up.  "
"147" "        I am user of this headphone since 2016 sound quality and bass is dominant  I am became a boat company fan after purchasing this. Now I am having almost all products of boatBut the sad part is boat 600 ear pads unbound and gone and the Meterial is just washed out after and year usageIf someone from boat is checking this review please provide a solution on ear pad issue may be in future may of them will face the same issue  "
"148" "        Material quality is of top class ...Very soft in feel ... Feels good on ears..Sound quality is exceptionally goodAnd battery life is awesome..Charge it for 3 hrs and it goes for 20 hrs...Only draw back is it doesn't gets sync with videos or games...I.e.  video and audio are not synchronised audio comes 0.5-1 seconds later which is noticeable  "
"149" "        This a decent item from boAt. Of course you cannot compare with Bose etc but the quality for the price is very good. ear Pads are comfortable and the bass is good along with the clarity  "
"150" "        Audio not in sync with the video, even though both the Headset & the receiver are Bluetooth 4.1. If you're using this just for music, then it's fine, has good bass. Noise cancellation is decent for the price.I would not suggest it for PC use, especially not for Gaming/movies. I have tested it with Youtube, VLC, PC games, etc. Returned it in a day.Delivery was good, Amazon's assistance in the Return process was seamless as well.  "
"151" "        Got the brown colored HPhones for 1999. Connectivity issues while u put it in ur pocket while walking as had to deal with lot of music break. Audio quality is OK, not much loud voice but observed sudden increase music volume by itself during listening. Pros are : best is  comfort fit and battery backup is good. But not the best headphones ard.  "
"152" "        Too delicate and Light weight. Need extra caution while handling. It doesn’t seem a durable productAlso the Bluetooth stops as and when I keep the phone in my trouser pocket and works back when I bring phone back to shirt pocketWhen the volume is full, it’s clearly audible to people near you.  "
"153" "        That is really awesome and I'm using it since April 2019. The bass is high and this would be useful for bass lovers. Sorry for the late review. I hope this would be helpfulUpdated on 4th June 2020:It's outer covering is corrupted but it still got the best quality of sound as it had when I bought. It's really a good headset but the outer cover should be improved to not corrupted by the body sweat.  "
"154" "        Overall sound quality is very good. Low range frequencies are reproduced very well - good bass as well. Phone calls were clear and could be disconnected from head phone device itself. Material quality is okay, could have been better though. Long hours usage is not comfortable.  "
"155" "        First of aux mode . sound is superb, especially the lower frequencies (Bass). Gives u the feel of surround sound and sub woofers. Really good volumeBluetooth mode: quality of sound is same as above only one thing is a Hick up, half a sec delay could be scene when watching movies on phn, second issue is .. Sometimes certain interference starts coming . for that I Hav to restart the headphones again. The interference goes away after that. DAT could due to my phn nt to sure though.Any how the headphones are really good. Very comfortable to ears ,soft pading is really soft.Only thing I regret is buying early @2000 , ri8 now it's priced at @1750  "
"156" "        Its being a while i m using this and i m proud that i choose this pair of headset.. sound quality is excellent and the base is literally so deep that i can feel it.. build quality is good but it could be better as the little wire comes out from band to speaker is little elegant.. but that doesnt matter if you take care of it.. secondly the AUX input is a little low as compared to bluetooth output.. and the thing which i hate the most is its long term use.. well i can only hear from it as long as 30mins to 45mins..  "
"157" "        Boat Rockerz 600 is absolutely a perfect product and value for money, I tried so many headphones and finally i got one who fulfilled all requirements in terms of comfortable to use long hours, awesome battery, sound is ultimate. I would definitely recommend this masterpiece (Brown).  "
"158" "        Product delivered on yesterday evening, External packing ok, but Internal packing was damaged with Open Box. It looks it has packed Manually, Not a Manufacturer Packing...Also The Microphone is not working well ,It very low voice reaching to other while talk someone..very disappointing...  "
"159" "        the connection  auto discounting and reconnecting while watching movies and listening songs.. and also its wear for continue two hours the ears paining...its damge profuct you have sent me...  "
"160" "        Its not durable few mistakes as when you have to power on the set we need to hold the power button for more than 10 seconds every time even then sometimes it wont start, thats annoying, second thing sound disturbances started comeing within a mo th if purchase  "
"161" "        Wow it's a more than expectation satisfaction.I am reviewing this item after used of 6 months.Every things are good... only one thing (range of Bluetooth coverage) is slightly improvement may give you a satisfaction more than the brand...But I think this is the best one in this price <U+0001F60D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44C><U+0001F44C>  "
"162" "        The sound quality is fabulous, at this price range,but using for long time is bit uncomfortable. At the description it should be mentioned wether this item is can be replaced or returned at description,it creates confusion among constumers and they get to know about this after the product is already puchased and delivered so no option is left with costumers.A well informed description is right of a costumer.This is not a informed choice left with costumers.  "
"163" "        Only one problem i noticed that some times sound and lips are not matchingAny one noticed that?Please let me knowBy the way uts my most favorite head phones and this is my 3rd purchase of same  "
"164" "        Two things i felt was annoying me with this head set is one the delay in the audio when u r watching movie while its  onnected with bluetooth mode, and other is it is not exactly very comfortable for a long time use. My ears started paining in an hour or so of the use. Other than that the sound quality and other features are great.worth my 1994 rupees.  "
"165" "        Finally i got my boAt Rockerz 600 Bluetooth....Superb.... it is very nice. The sound quality is very good. No Negative comments. if they provide good quality box for protecting it will be good.  "
"166" "        Worst product, bluetooth does not turn on after 1 month of use.  "
"167" "        This is is pretty good, especially considering the price. sound quality is good for the money you pay. I regularly use it at the gym. The grip is good and doesn't fall off when you're working out. Battery life is exceptional. Have been using this for 6 months now. Very happy with the product.  "
"168" "        Sound quality for that cost is no way matching. Can’t use it for the long run, the material quality of the speaker area is very hard that I feel pain at earlobes if use for the long time. Connectivity issue is too much. I play PUBG using them, but sometimes player can not listen my voice even when I’m connected. I’ll have to restart it then reconnect it.  "
"169" "        The product was working all good initially. I never used it for more than 30 at a stretch though. And my usage was very minimal, like once or Max couple of times in a week.I happen to watch a movie for the very first time with this heads on and there the sound scar was seen. After an avg of every 15-20 mins I gotta switch the headphones off and back on due to sound flickering.Not sure if I'm the only one facing this. It's quite annoying to keep switching it off and on every now and then. The sound quality is at it's best (when working fine) I must say. But sound flickering is disturbing.Quite disappointed!  "
"170" "        It's been 1.5 years and I'm still using these headphones!Pros:Battery life 8-10 hoursGood bassVery high volumeBuilt material is goodButtons on right ear which are easy to accessCons:Now speakers have burst after 1.5 yearsThe upper part gets tornThat's it!!I would recommend this in this budget!  "
"171" "        Best product to buy in the range of 2000-2500. I can listen songs continuously for 6 -8 hrs. Full charging can be attained within 1.5-2 hrs . The noise cancellation is perfect . Range is not that much it varies between 9ft -12 ft. once you go beyond 9 ft the volume will be lowered. Compatible with all devices , got connected easily with my laptop as well as phones.Main problem is ear adjustment which you will feel at start but after 2-3 days it will not . Sound is pretty good with awesome bass .  "
"172" "        It's a good product that I would like to recommend. But after purchasing, I tried to charge it but it did not take charge up to 100 percent and I tried many times and the maximum was 90 percent. Apart from that, it's a very good headphone. I recommend it to anyone who wants to purchase a headphone with noise cancellation.  "
"173" "        Person standing in the other room could hear the songs I was listening to at half the volume. As a user , I prefer to have my privacy for songs and do not want others to know what I'm listening to particularly. The songs were clearly audible to people around me. Seemed more like a speaker than headphones.Sound quality was good though. Bass is not necessarily good. Headphones are pretty loud.  "
"174" "        its bass,sound quality noise cancellation bluetooth connectivity and material quality  and comfortness everything is super and battery backup is exelent one thing is noted while connected to mobile most usefull thing is its shows remaining battery percentage in mobile display so we can charge it  accordingly. Thanks amazon for a good product in this price range.  "
"175" "        Amazing product... Sound quality is too good.. specially if u love listening to instrumental music...Just dat if ur using this headphones to watch movies..there s a lil lag in the audio and video sinking...otherwise the product is worth buy...  "
"176" "        What an amazing headphones with crystal clear and crispy sound, so far I haven't experienced this quality in any other headphones even if they are of so called branded..Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery.  "
"177" "        Great Bass! A Little low on the treble but nothing worrisome.Listening to the music is good experience and comfortable. Due to my careless handling the both the cushion came off after 6 months and now it hurts my ears if I use the headphone for too long, although i have gotten accustomed to it. After all we are Indians.Quality is nice and Sound is awesome (especially true for EDM, Trap, etc). Go for It. Take care of the headphone and you would be good.  "
"178" "        Bought this for fire stick and it paired fine. Sound quality is excellent for the price.The issue is that there is problem in pairing with additional device  "
"179" "        I bought these headphones,  battery life was awesome and sound was also smooth but after sometime it's one side started creating a disturbing sound, so I texted a complain to boat official website and they changed it within a month and now I have a new headphone. Boat service is best and it is also a trustable brand.  "
"180" "        Well built with good quality materials.The  ear cups are soft and although these headphones are 'on-ear' type, yet they are very comfortable for long term use.Sound is rich, although not as punchy as bass lovers would prefer. But the sound is not disappointing in any aspect.Good connectivity over bluetooth although one can also use these with the Aux cable provided.Lastly, the headfones look sexy!  "
"181" "        Used for the last four days. Good bass and clear sound.Battery is good and it lasts as advertised. Boat Rockers 600  is a boon for music lovers.  "
"182" "        Positives: For me the only positive thing about it  was it has all the features i wanted within the budget. It properly on our ears and delivered to me on time.negatives: Noise cancellation is poor. We cant use this if we travel in bus or train. Due to the noise from outside , we won't be hearing anything from this headphone. Sound quality can be better. I am not that much satisfied with this product. just ok k.  "
"183" "        Really shocked and disappointed with the product.... It worked amazing in the beginning. It's been 2 months that i have purchased them and now they lose connection when mobile is kept in the pocket while walking. Even the comfort provided in the initial days is now not the way it was.  Didn't expect boat headphones to work this way and that to also rockerz 600. Disappointed with amazon to deliver such poor quality product. Hope my complaint is heard and responded in appropriate manner.  "
"184" "        Product quality amazing...however final product finish was not as fine as expected...A minimal complaint I have is about the voice amplifying ability. If you need really high volume this product is not ideal. Otherwise trust me it is really awesome. It needs to be handled with care sine it has lots of movable twisting parts. You ha e to be extra careful  "
"185" "        Dislike is Only one <U+261D>point I'll bolna chata hun this is not for Jogging. And when u see the video's little bit disturbing irrigating sound aata hai. Bar bar bluetooth ko of on karna padhta hai.  Otherwise everything Will be perfect. Aankh moochke lelo. It'll be Worthy of your money. Don't think about this extra thing's. U just Blindly go for it<U+0001F44D>.Ears<U+0001F442> cup after one year it'll be damaged. You give tthe extra one more pairs.  "
"186" "        If you want a Bluetooth headphone under Rs.2000/-, This is the one.The sound and bass are very nice and the passive noise cancellation works very well except the fact that I can still hear some noise.Maybe this is the best headphone in this price range.Thanks for reading my review!<U+0001F600><U+0001F600>  "
"187" "        The sound quality is okay and they're pretty comfortable over ears too because of the soft cushions, the head band is also comfortable.The bass is pretty decent and the Audio level is okay too  "
"188" "        I compared its sound quality with Skullcandy S5URJW-546, Pro: volume level in boAt is similar, the bass is approx same, has a premium quality look. Con: I found a slightly greater lag while playing video via Bluetooth in boAt (even the other phone was lagging a bit) (was using windows 10).With a price range of 2K, it is a nice budget Headphone if you want to use primarily for music, you need to plug out of Bluetooth mode for better movie experience.  "
"189" "        At first i thought of buying some effort-able headset for my daily use ..... i had few other products in my mind yet i gave a push for this new company boat ...... its materiel quality is great when i first saw it .....  sound quality was great in Bluetooth mode where there is more bass in sound and in aux mode  the sound is pretty  high yet there is a compromise in sound quality....... battery life is great i can say because i don't  know when did i last charged my head set  .....over all great product i recommend this... :)  "
"190" "        For the price this is worth 10 times! Sound quality is crazy, I have a JBL E55BT which is worth Rs 6000 but I feel that boat rockerz 600 has better bass not too much and better mids and overall better balance! Good for any Music Genre and movies! Not as comfortable as the JBL E55BT but good for the price! And I have bought over 500 items on amazon but never have written a review because im lazy but I like it so much im writing this!  "
"191" "        Decent sound quality and pu leather material for stress free on ear cushions very comfortable 5***** from my side and my device showed status of battery 80% when i switched on it very first time after 3hrs of continuous usage at full volume noticed that there is a 10% of battery usage (70%) will update my review after 1 month again as it was just 2 days. Overall a decent product and Amazon=Amazing=Awesome..Thanks.<U+0001F44D>  "
"192" "        Amazing product from Boat. The deep bass is amazing. There's also the right amount of muffled effect and it shows especially in heavy music. Feels premium. There might be a bit of idle distortion though.Absolute VFM for 2K.  "
"193" "        The Material Quality is good but this variant grts dirty too quickly. Also I found it a little tighter than the black variant. It presses the head more, After 20-30 minutes these is a slight pain in ears and head as well. Battery life is Extra Ordinary. Charge it once and forget it for 10 days if you are an average Music lover.  "
"194" "        Why do people need anything other than this ? For the cost that you pay the sound quality, wearing comfort is on par and perhaps much better than a lot of premium headphones.. if you are a music and bass lover, would need something in your budget to use while you are working or traveling, this is what you need to buy !! Period!!  "
"195" "        Bought it on 21st Jan. initially was very happy with quality of sound and it worked well for 40 days and now sound is cracking as if speakers are worn out. Lot of electrical noise every time I try using it. Worthless piece of crap.  "
"196" "        You will not be disappoited, all features sound effect volume BT are excellant. Never BUY  One Odio or MI headphones, they are cheap in sound quality and effect  "
"197" "        Delivered by amazon prime in 2 days.product was nicely packed.thanks to amazon.now with headphone,this is my first wireless headphone.up till now using boAt wired in ear headset.if u r music lover and specially bass lover then go for it.this headphone is bomb of bass.and hava a crystal clear sound.i will say these r excellent wireless headphone in market now.i will give 10 stars to this headphones.strongly recommonded.  "
"198" "        Quality budget headphones. Tried with aux and without aux. Sound and bass is good with aux and without aux on mobile but when connected to laptop without aux sound is good not great but with aux it's great. Giving 3 star with my first day review!Comfortable and light weight!Got one pouch, aux and usb cable.  "
"199" "        I must give 2 star to this product only because this product is very uncomfortable to wear for more than 10 min. That's because when you put this headphone on your ears it presses uncomfortably against your area near ear and you get headache after a while. The bass boosted sound is quite satisfactory and all but what's the use when you can't wear this thing for more than 2 songs.  "
"200" "        Calls are crystal clear, someitme other side people say my voice is low so i have to adjust my headphone. No problem in Bluetooth connectivity and amazoing sound for listening songsI was so happy with this, i purchased same  when my brother enquired about headphoen and gifted him  "
"201" "        I have received said product faulty on arrival. Product bluetooth is not working.I have not intimidated about fault of said product to you because I am not available at station.Please  exchange  if possible take the necessary action on that.Thanks  & Regards  "
"202" "        Dammn good product. Like other headphone if they r used for long periods it starts ear paining... It won'tAnd the soft padding is of good quality... That won't come out easilySometimes I had issue for bluetooth connectivity whenever I kept my headphone in pant's pocket. Wasn't much big prblm.  "
"203" "        Sound quality is awesome even bass is high you can get clear sound of all instrument and voice very clear,,, ear pads a bit extra soft,,but leather quality is good.battery life is 5 star <U+2B50> 4 or 5 days in normal use..Buttons are easy to tap and comfortable,, aprox 1.5 second delay in video and gaming but with aux cable is exact no sound delay,,, it connect very fast  with device..Overall its  a good choice <U+0001F607><U+0001F607>  "
"204" "        1) Sound quality is good2) power backup is very good2) When we use for the call, other person will hear noice or low voice3) experienced time lag with sound when watching movie hence lip sync is missing4) it's fit on the ear so prolonged use  causes ear pain as per my experience  "
"205" "        Its a good set of headphones. Sound quality is good. Charge lasts for 2 days or about 6 hrs of listening.Now, for the cost i paid, when i compare it to other headphones in its price range, this is quite easily among the best.  "
"206" "        I felt like a little distortion after 10 mins of Bluetooth connectivity. And of course audio delay while playing movies. But all of this is solved once you plug in the aux. (Not comparing) If you have used skullcandy crushers this headphones has a light bass vibration over your ear which is so cool if we look at the cost. Obviously no ANC but cmon you get so much under 2000 bucks.  "
"207" "        I bought it last month , was a bit sceptical initially . But the product is good , connects easily and lasts for reasonable time on full charge , is comfortable on ears and sound quality is good .  "
"208" "        I have a big head. The headphone is super comfortable to use for long hours. Audio is good. However, not suitable for video (youtube, movies etc) as there is a lag between video and audio (tried on windows 10, android as well as ipad). Wanted to return but kept it just for audio.  "
"209" "        Happy to got this.  Must buy this model and brown color.. easy to carry..Worst amazon delivery service as they provide a agent no. On which if we call, it will never allow you to contact delivery agent..rest ..Product is awesome....  "
"210" "        Pros - battery life is superb n almost last 20hrs n very handy n foldableComfort - quite comfortable n light weight ( sometimes it hurts if used for long duration )Sound - balanced high low bass everything superb n bass is really nice with punch effectTip - if u want loud noise then connect with aux n play it, it almost increases 20-30% volume level compared to Bluetooth  "
"211" "        Using this since 1 year. I have loved this headphone,  battery backup is good. If fully charged, it gives backup for 1 week (daily  average usage ~3 hours) . cushion is good.  One bad thing is your ears will pain after using it for 2 hours, so i will recommend to take break in 30min, this is also good as it reduces the pressure on ears.  "
"212" "        Absolutely worth the price. Don't go for the black one, this model's battery is slightly higher capacity than the black ones. Loved the headphones at the very first usage. It's been more than a month since I bought it. I feel the treble is slightly higher, the bass is real good. Great performance for its price. It's battery is robust. Go for it..  "
"213" "        I just admit I was a bit skeptical about the Boat brand and the headphone quality, but I must admit these are surprisingly good headphones for the price. Lots of bass without any obvious loss of quality at other frequencies (I’m sure there must be but I doubt you will notice). Very comfortable to wear and great battery life too. So, if you’re looking for headphones at this budget, I can highly recommend these cans.  "
"214" "        As expected, rockerz 600 excel in sound quality, noise cancellation is perfect and bass is accurate. No distortion in high, mids and lows.Only drawback is the audio lag which is quite evident watching videos or playing any game.Over all, Value for money in this price segment. Pretty happy with this product. Amazon did a great job delivering the product intact and in time.  "
"215" "        Pros:Best product for the reasonable price. Sound quality and bass are very good.Battery backup is the best part, comes around a week.Cons:Some may feel discomfortable as it seems pressing the ear.The height adjuster has become loose.  "
"216" "        Has really nice sound and good battery.Really loved the product at one point of time.But real issue is after sales support and issue with ear cushion. I had bought three boat products and all have issues with their ear cushions which comes off after 7 months. There is no way to fix it after warranty period and when I called the customer care they asked me to throw the headphone away.  "
"217" "        Poor on ear cup material worn-out after a moderate usage  "
"218" "        Amazon delivered good product always and delivery was good ,Boat rockerzzzzzzzzz extra bassssss really very good bass and sound quality is just awesome ,And talk about comfortable its very good ,and also headphone quality is super like premium ,Value for moneyGo for it .  "
"219" "        This is one of the best out there. Have been using it for past two years. The sound is at par with the price . May be better. Has a great product life. The ear paddings are extremely comfortable but wears out and comes off with time. The sound quality never depriciates. Never fails to impress and so also the battery backup time...  "
"220" "        Purchased 10 month back--*Battery life is good.*Good to use for calling in closed place.. too muchbackground noice on other end when we use it in noisy environment.*Sometime sound is coming with intrupt.. but reconnecting device solves this problem.  "
"221" "        Quality wise: 4/5Sound: 5/5Bass: 6/5 :-)Clarity: 5/5Serves the purpose at this costNote to remember: it's lil delicate, use it carefully to expect long life of cushion and headphones. All the best with your purchase.  "
"222" "        The looks are good, but the audio lag(while playing video) takes over all the positive points which this head set has and made me feel irritaed and finally I was forced to ask for a replacement after a discussion with  Amazon and if the same is repeated will go for a refund, hope like hell that the issue won't persist in the replacement piece.  "
"223" "        Didn't work for more than a year that too with limited usage. One side of speaker stopped working within few months.  "
"224" "        Every time when i click on power on button, it wont switch on and face so many issues with power button. every time again i have to plugin power and then if i click then it will switch on. after using it you can't even switch it off. simply i am switching off my mobile Bluetooth. so that headphones will turn off automatically after few minutes. coming to sound its good but not for the price they have kept. they have to increase the quality in the making and even in sound.  "
"225" "        the headphones are made of good quality materials,they are soft and comfortable on the ears,and we get all the accessories that could be required,except for a charges,but any usb slot charger can used for that purpose.sound is above average not to much bass and while using sometimes has lag with some of the older devices,but it has better sound than many other headphones in the same price range,the battery backup is excellent.  "
"226" "        Pros:SturdyComfortable (for 3-4 hours)Easy connectivity and interfaceStandby battery life last over 2 monthsCons:Average sound qualityAverage mic qualityCan't wear these for too long  "
"227" "        I like this headphone, it is a very good quality product but in discription of Amazon it is given that it can work wirelessly upto 20m but it doesn't work properly enough at 6 to 7m  and its noise cancellation quality is good but not satisfactory. And also like the battery quality. Good ear cups. And easily extend as much you can want.  "
"228" "        Worked very well untill one side speaker gave in.Now only the right side works when in Bluetooth mode. Speakers are fine as both sides work when connected with wire.Sound quality was good while it lasted(7 months).Ventilation for ear is zero, so most people need to remove and wear again as it gets uncomfortable after a while.  "
"229" "        I loved everything about this!The sound quality is great and the bass is also very goodThe only thing is in long usage u will sweat and I gave 4/5 for material quality because the left side became lose after using for 2 months otherwise soundwise it's very good and it's good for gaming too except the bass kicks in when someone shoots...And the mic is not so good and when the splitter is used with the provided data cable the mic doesn't work at all for pc  "
"230" "        Awesome quality headset. The best feature is it contours the headset according to the ear shape and is very comfy. Does not give pressure on the ears. Crisp sound quality.  "
"231" "        Battery Life is awesome.Quality of foam pads is not so good.Sound Volume is good.Very good amount of Bass.Delay between sound and video while watching video in Bluetooth mode.Overall we can say its a good headphone.  "
"232" "        I have used it just once.It has a good bass and the sound quality is also great overall the sound quality is awsome . There no sound delay while watching youtube. I have seen both offline and online videos in youtube too on my phone its did'nt lag . For pc i cannot say,but it truely lags while playing pubg , their is 3,4 sec of sound delay.  Else all good except online gamming.  "
"233" "        The music sound looks good, how ever it has Bluetooth continuity issues, like if you are hearing music and get a call then once the call is completed not able to get back to the music, I have to disconnect and reconnect again to hear the music, same issue when doing Skype call, I don't have similar problem with my current Plantronics head set. Also it is tight for me, after using sometime my ears started paining.  "
"234" "        People who see me using the stylish headphones unfailingly ask me about them. Their usual, collective refrain is, “These must be really expensive!” And they ask me for the product details eagerly once I tell them these ones cost less than INr 2,500/-. The comfort is amazing and the 40 M.M. drivers do their duty really well in terms of overall sound quality and the bite of bass they deliver.  "

"236" "        Truly mind blowing head phones... I RECKON there is no better package till 5000 rupees... Range is pretty much, i am able to walk the whole stretch of my house without any glitch, glitch occurs when you start to change floors(eg. From 1st floor to ground floor etc)...Also the grip of the headphones is great, you might feel your ear paining after very long use,but since it's adjustable,you wont have much trouble... Battery back up is SUPERB, i used this headphones for two weeks after delivery without charging,but also depends on how much you use daily Cause on an average i listen to it for atleast 30-45mins max...Bass is very strong,i compared it my Sony Extra  bass and it gave a run for the money, really  strong bass,yoy will be be thrilled , but on rare occasions you might find some mild vibration in the ear cup, that's the only reason i gave it 4 stars... Otherwise go for it<U+0001F44D>  "
"237" "        A good buy for this price. I read somewhere that boAt is an indian company. Good opportunity to be patriotic if so :-). Noice reduction is one part you will feel like this headphone is not par with other high end products. Sound quality is ok for a headphone of this price. One severe probem i’ve noticed is some intermittent connection breaks sometimes that is affecting my smooth and seemless listening to music etc. I’ve been using the product for couple of weeks and satisfied so far.  "
"238" "        Stitching on headband is unravelling already and I just got it 2 days ago. It takes a lot of effort to even switch it on and off even after holding for a while and trying multiple times. It is such a chore to use. Seems like they sent me a defective product with a low battery. Not at all pleased as I wanted to use it for a trip.  "
"239" "        It's very gud product.. this review is after using 3 months almost.  I feel very gud abt this. Talking about sound  quality it's like huge pay back for your moneny..... very comfortBut 1 draw back I can say here is the whn Bluetooth connected and u ans the calls some noise brk u will feel and moreover u hve speak vry louad thn only nxt person can here u better to update Bluetooth version....  "
"240" "        1)Amazing Quality with wire2)Minor problems on voice transfer when we speak On Wireless mode3) Look not so impressive as seen in description image4) Ear Pad Are delicate - teared  "
"241" "        Much better than others in this range. Bass and sound quality is also the best. And the most I liked is comfortablity.  "
"242" "        Sounds really good.Nice battery back up.recommended.but once it happened to:disconnect inbetween and then keeps on disconnecting. very erratic. but after charging it connected properly.  "
"243" "        I Recommend not to buy this product unless u only use it for music coz it releases glitchy and uncomfortable noise like a old radio when you watch any youtube video or movies...i hope its the bluetooth connectivity issue with this product and iam reviewing it after 3 monthsof usage  "
"244" "        Boat rockers 600 is amazing productThe sound quality is soo good Noice cancellation is awesomeKeep the volume to 20% for molodies songsKeep volume 50% for movie sound effectKeep the volume 75% for pub like musicKeep the volume 100% for earth shaking woofer effect will make you enjoy the music every bitBut during phone call I am not that satisfied the clarity of sound is low  it is not critical clear so I have given 4****  "
"245" "        Sound quality is awesome. Battery backup is good and as stated. Charges in a couple of hours.I had some trouble connecting with laptop but after updating driver it worked quite well.Latency can be overcomed by using wired mode.I'm quite happy with the product.  "
"246" "        Do buy this product definitely worth it....it works like a champ and a true life saver. Battery is so perfect that u need to charge it for 10-15min u can use it for couple of hours...sound quality is so good definitely worth it...and the luxury is the one to buy...it has so much style to it comes in a pretty good box....if anyone is interested in this product just go for it.  "
"247" "        A decent product.... Sound Quality is very good and bass too.... Much more sound than the headphones of same price range.... Good connectivity too because of 4.1 version....but the thing which I noticed that the sealed is open... many customers review the same against opened seal... don’t know why this?Is this the replaces ones or something else???  "
"248" "        When I received the packet, main carton was not sealed. And it was already open.Though the product inside seems intact but not sure if it is new or notShall observe it for a few days on performance  "
"249" "        I don't feel that this is worth for 21 hundred .. its better to go for other ... Buttons hard to press switch oON and off .I am not happy with this product ...  "
"250" "        Good product..really good sound with clarity.awesome noise cancellation and noise leakage propertyCons: mic not really good over Skype calls. And there is few second delay when watching videos on phone..I have returned the product since my main reason to purchase headset was to make calls.Go for it if you want to use it to listen music!  "
"251" "        The headphones are amazing for the price tag.  Sound and built quality is exceptional.  Looks good as well. Happy with the product. <U+2714><U+FE0F>  "
"252" "        Poor quality and design.I wanted to return but the original packaging cover was misplaced.So unable to return.Can I return now.  "
"253" "        I have bought these headphones rockerz 600 in the mid of Oct 2018, from around March end week or April first week it is not working for calls at all. I tried to use it for the calls by keeping it full charge and disconnecting and connecting it but all my trials went in vain. Please let me know how to return it or exchange it or repair it, I have the warranty still.  "
"254" "        Have been using this product for over a year now. The product has great battery life this was never a problem for me.Sound quality is above average has space to improve though.Disappointed with the ear muffs quality as gets ruined if u sweat a bit. Not good for gym use. They are made of some poor quality material and not leather. And I could not find any replacement.  "
"255" "        Great sound, soft ear pads, light weight and wireless. This is the perfect headphone that any guy would want. The battery can last for hours. Bluetooth works great. Amazing product from not a very big brand. Totally recommended.  "
"256" "        Pros-Has deep bass including perfect passive noise cancellationCons-Though it has soft ear cushions,it stucks...Sometimes ear pain is feltAfter some days my ear cushions started tearing as I noticed its just thinner leather coat on the cushion  "
"257" "        boat rockerz 510 are better than thisbecause the are comfortable for long time use and there bass is awsm also loud but in boat 600 slow voice mic quilty also k k and there is no base and if u use this for 1 hour there is pain in your ear and all small dots of headphone will be printed on your ear  "
"258" "        The product is good,Sound quality is great and the battery life is superb.On an average use, it gives me a backup of more than a month.But it's not very loud and there's some amount of audio lag while gaming and watching offline videos.Otherwise it's great.It's gives you so much bank for the buck.Amazing product.  "
"259" "        Awesome product. Bass is good. You could hear the sounds of all the instrument clearly. Connects to your smartphone very easily via Bluetooth. There is some lag between the music and the videos while playing video files. Recommends to all casual music listeners like me.  "
"260" "        Serious sound lagging issues. When connected via Bluetooth. it seriously creates a problem( sound lags a lot).PS : Might be possible, issue with my set.  "
"261" "        It’s a very headphone at this price. Bought during amazon sale but had to return it since product which I got was old and used.  "
"262" "        Posting this after several months of usage.. one of the best finest quality headset which has tremendous sound quality and battery backup.. I liked the important factor is that to call others and speak without struggle .. speaker and mic is really good in frequency...  "
"263" "        Hii guys,This is not good for pubg in wireless mode, getting delay voice, dont pirchase this for pubgSolution: With aux you can play pubgOverall good but not for pubg in wireless mode.Thanks  "
"264" "        Super Sound quality on this price, I'm using boat first, but my first experience is very good, Battery life also good on average use it last long upto 1& half week, premium quality look & material, also giving comfirt on your ear  "
"265" "        Excellent. Highly recommended at a budget of 2.2k you get 10 times worth the amount. Bass levels do not get distorted even at the highest level. Aux cable which i received seems to be damaged internally. Or else rest is all ok.  "
"266" "        Product is fit & finely delivered & brand new but the quality of sound is good not best or exceptional you can buy without a doubt if tight on your budget otherwise go for higher brands like  Sennheiser beats skullcandy bose etc  "
"267" "        Sound quality is worth the price range. sound clarity is good. Bass is deep. Rating a star less coz of the delay in sync while watching videos via Bluetooth. Not yet used for calling purpose. Overall recommendation will be worth purchasing.  "
"268" "        Sound and base quality of this headset is excellent but if you speak with someone with headset the other persion can't hear your voice clearly, and also the after use of 1 year the artificial rubber in the cousin is coming out of headset.  "
"269" "        A very buy able and very decent piece of cans. Good Soundstage . Clear mid range and treble. The bass isn't earth shaking but its quite decent. Only con is the design of the buttons which you can accidentally press a lot of times. Not a big fan of the mic though.  "
"270" "        I'll say the cons only-bad connectivity (especially near railway stations it doens't play songs well at all keeps stopping)-it hurts your ears if you wear specs and wear headphones for a long time  "
"271" "        I have compared various headphones but boat rockers give better bass and treble at the same time very much comfortable for longer hours of usageBattery life is superb,don't think further just buy it in amazon  "
"272" "        Sound quality and battery life is awesomeBut can't use it more than 30 minutes.A little bit extra tight for years which make it uncomfortable after 30 minutes.Otherwise very good battery life and devastating base.Go for the golden one.  "
"273" "        It's been almost a year since usage. Bluetooth mode is not recommended for gaming as there is lag.  The aux cable has started to give problem. The music can be heard but not the lyrics with wire connected (mostly problem with aux cable or port) . In Bluetooth mode works perfectly  "
"274" "        If u r music lover go with boat rockerzz 600Everything is good except designBoat rockerz 510 design is very premium when compared to rockerzz 600 sound quality and bass is less and the main problem with 510 is if u listen at full volume the person sitting in next room will be easily able to hearBoth can be used as wired  "
"275" "        Aftert using 11months  it started  giving trouble...kabhi band ho ja ta 15 min baad...I buy it because boat ka itna naam suna tha...but I am very much disappointed...  "
"276" "        Just awesome <U+0001F44C>,,,if u r addicted for music then it's very affordable ,if u r purchase 4 gaming then it's not at all.Bass quality superb <U+0001F44C><U+0001F525>Finishing is very nice..Noise cancellation also better.I recommend u go for brown...I love this <U+0001F60D> at all very nice product <U+0001F44C>  "
"277" "        The headphones are very delicate not for rough and tough use...the sound quality is good for the price...it is light weight so you can wear it for long time ..battery life also decent overall good product for traveling and other purpose  "
"278" "        Don't think for even one movement. Just go for it . I have tried sony xb450 ap and jbl . Nothing can match this the brown colour variant is highly luxurious and gives a feel of leather with all parts metalic. Batery life is extraordinary comfrt is utmost. Pain in years noticable after 1.5 hr of use first time that after removing headphones not while listening. I am sure this will subside after someday. At this price range you won't believe its quality and design.  "
"279" "        One of the best product in boAt. Earlier I had couple of boAt head phones but all those were broken quickly due to bad quality of plastic. This product is pretty good and soft. Sound is also amazing  "
"280" "        If  yu  Are  a  Hard  gamer  of  pubg  plzzz  Dont  buy  this  some time  the  game  voice  will be  gone  and  yu just feel  like  yu buyed  a Garbage  thanks  to  amazon  very  nice  service  by  amazon  loveee  yu  they  return  my  product <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>  "
"281" "        The box of headphones was badly scratched. Tapping on teared parts. The product looked old. Pathetic experience. Too tight on ear, poor built quality. Returning without even test playing.I wish there was an option of zero rating.  "
"282" "        Everything is cool but that wire part makes  little to worry, im sacred that ill cut it .bass is cool,audio clarity is upto mark.I tried charging about 2 hours but i dint see blue Indication ie it has completes charging.soon ill update more  "
"283" "        The headphone skin is very bad, not comfortable for long usage, you feel uncomfortable, after 6 month of usage it got damaged the the skin got peal  "
"284" "        Bass is perfect else all good.. Faux leather is very comfortable and gives 8hrs playback time when charged full. Also Bluetooth connectivity is fast and controls are okay as you have to press long for volume which is many times replaced as forward/next. Dual method (Aux) cable is way helpful for long stretch but sound output is seen fainted as compared when listened in Bluetooth. Hence a good buy for 2k, go for it<U+0001F44D>  "
"285" "        This is the second boat headphone I purchased. Within a year the outer layer of the ear cups started peeling off and the black powdery pieces sticking/falling everywhere. Even the bluetooth has stopped working and rendering the mic useless.  "
"286" "        These Headphones are best choice in this price segment. Even way better than the big brands providing under 3000. You might have feel a bit discomfort on ears while using them for very long as they are give a verry little pressure on ears. But this is also much better than any other headphone. Sound quality is awesome. Just go for it.  "
"287" "        Good Bluetooth headphones at this price rangePros:Great battery up to 15 hoursGood bass and trebleEar cushions very soft and comfortCons:1)Constant interference while watching videos online through bluetooth2) Ears will sweat when using for long time i.e more than an hour  "
"288" "        Intense Bass if you are a bass lover. The high, mid and low are good but the bass ruins the quality of stereo at times. Doesn't cause pain on your ears and comfortable. The batter is huge and I never tried to drain it so far and my highest usage is 8 hours of continuous music. The promised backup for this special edition is 20 hours. The problem is with WiFi interference and the range.  "
"289" "        Material quality is goodSound quality is very good (some times bass is very over powering)Battery life is awesome (Getting around 12 to 14 Hrs)There is a bit of delay in YouTube(you won't notice it) and it is noticable in playing games like pubg (like 1 or 2 sec). Connect aux cable for games then it's okOverall good for the price  "
"290" "        At this price point go for it, very comfortable neat and clear voice production, main plus is comfortable, for external looks it may slide from your ears while you using it. For music listening , relax, chill go for it not suggested for show off. Better select alternative other models.  "
"291" "        Nice product from boAt. The boAt Rockerz 600 bluetooth headpone sounds great. The baas and overall listening experience is good. The product is super cheap for its amazing quality and features. The delivery from Amazon is super fast as always, before delivery time. I am fully satisfied from this product.  "
"292" "        Giving 3* due to personal experience I had,  otherwise it deserves 4 as sound quality is really good. In my case it didn't got connected well with my MI note 4 there was frequent break in music, same was case with moto g5s,  the cable provided for aux and charging were of real poor quality. For boat headphones such accessories were not expected.  "
"293" "        Great for listening to music, super battery backup, seamless Bluetooth connectivity, however a major flaw is it picks up a lot of noise while using for calls. Almost unusable for conference calls.  "
"294" "        The power on / off button is not working correctly. Despite holding the button for more than 10 secs, the headphone doesn't start or stop. Have ordered for a replacement. Hope so the replacement product wouldn't have similar issues. Sound quality no doubt is the best. Noise cancellation is amazing. Blocks outside noise completely.  "
"295" "        Very happy sound quality is awesome network is great I leave in 800 square feet house hardlt loose network also it cuts outside noise nicely battery is long lasting it's been a month and half I m using it  "
"296" "        I have received fungi in my headphone. I ordered a brand new product and service is really disappointed when received. Nd it smells bad too. What kind of products they are sending these days if it is brand new and still worse at the beginning.How can I trust this with long term or any other promises they made.  "
"297" "        M really happy with what I purchased I was confused spending my money buying this through amazon but trust me after ready my gud happy review everyone should go for this one ...... gud sound,gud battery backup,gud strong headphones,gud button touch features also  "
"298" "        Good for the given price of the product. Best Sound quality with HD sound definition and Bass. Battery life is awesome. But one thing that I didn't like was quality of Aux Cable provide with it. Also sound delay happened in milliseconds when using Bluetooth for watching online video. No such problem while using offline or downloaded video and while using Aux cable.  "
"299" "        Fabulous bass,awesome sound.. Stylish black n light brown combination looks sexy..bhut a big problem thats need to be solved by the developers that is  the delay of video decreases and increases particularly of each variations... Plz solved it. product is awesome standard one  "
"300" "        The Product is totally as expected. The Headphones are too stylish with the black color finish.Sound quality is also very impressive, it is so comfortable that you feel comfy when put on the headphones.The battery backup is also good 6-7 hours easily. Controls are also very good as in description. I have bought several products at amazon but for this cant stop myself to give it a good review..  "
