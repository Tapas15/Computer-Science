["\n\n  The same thing happening in the new replaced phone also I feel disappointed it's not worth for the money. It's hanging a lot in phone application.

I didn't expect this from one plus. Totally waste product...\n\n", "\n\n  Everything is best except the thing that one plus hasn't provided headphones with handset..n even cleaning cloth is not there...only one transparent cover case is available..phone doesn't have headphones jack n hence it should have provided headphones..mine is mirror Black..\n\n", '\n\n  \xa0Do watch the video.

I'll tell, how it works with the Things it have..1. Oh Boy, the Display, It's Smooth as Butter.. I think it's the best thing of this Phone.. You can use it all day and It's really really Awesome. No Display and I say No Display is Smooth and Vivid as This One...2. Speed! 90Hz Display and SD 855 show it's Muscle here.. From app opening to Gaming, it does everything smoothly!3. Build Quality is Great. It feels Solid. No way it's A One Handed Device. Slightly Heavier Side.4. Warp Charge!! Yesterday at Night 11.30 pm I started Charging with 11% Battery. Within 12.35 am it's 100%. It's Blazing Fast.Now Let's Talk about some Mediocre Stuff-4. Camera! It's Ok I'd say.. Colour is slightly shifted.. I don't know Why but My Poco is Capturing Better image than this in Automatic Mode.. It's Good and like traditional One Plus Camera.. The Only Weakness!! Front Camera is good but nothing Mind-blowing Crazy..  It tends to Crop too much in Front Camera Portrait Shots.I hope One Plus implement Wide Angle Video Recording..All I can say, It's Good Phone for 52K.. Value for Money.. But Market will be Competitive in May with Asus and Redmi New Launch. So if you can, Wait for 1 Month and Compare with Other Things.But If for Display, I will Choose this Phone Anyday over Upcoming Ones.. It's Best.... I think till Samsung Note 10, the One Plus Display will be Champion in Market.I didn't talk about 3.0 UFS storage cause everyday usage you won't see much difference.And Sorry for my Poor English!\n\n", "\n\n  Camera quality is almost same as 6T, which is worst, utterly flopped popup cameraDisplay of dark cell is very bad, M30 is much better than thisI don't know about this ram, without optimizing software, more power consumption which leads battery drains fast over multi tasking and produces heat.Finally oneplus is no more for mid range premium customers. 10k higher\n\n", '\n\n  Camera quality is not up to mark as per price range.

Then definitely go for this and I think 8GB RAM variant is good enough I don't know why they made 12 GB variant\n\n", "\n\n  First time I have purchased one plus phone (one plus 7 pro) but my experience is very bad due to phone camera quality and battery life. Pictures are blur and camera can't focus on subject, pictures showing good in camera before clicking but after click picture goes blur. I have done every troubleshooting but problem is still same. Battery also work for 4-5 hours. So I want to return it. Because I have spent a very big amount on this phone but I am very disappointed by Amazon and one plus.\n\n", "\n\n  One of the best phones I have used, be it android or iOS.The performance is buttery smooth, compared side by side with a Oneplus 6T, and 90hz display really makes a hell lot of difference.Updated to the 9.5.4 available while writing the review, and the battery life is awesome, getting 6 hrs screen on time with 90hz display. Camera is decent, just put the GCam, and it becomes a versatile camera option to shoot in different scenarios.Warp charging is the highlight and really charges the phone pretty quick, I don't miss my dash charging even with this huge battery.The haptic motor is finally really good, and now typing and other small tasks gives that satisfying vibrations.Stereo speakers are of really good quality and they are loud and clear.As for the headphone jack and adapter, everyone should know that before getting this device, spending ‚Çπ50k for a device without prior research is your mistake. Sure they should have given atleast an adapter, but it's no reason to give this one star.Overall, really awesome device, much better than the exynos galaxy that we get here in India.\n\n", "\n\n  Very bad product, many functions doesn't work, I have OnePlus 5 and I didn't feel any issue with my old phone till now, don't buy, you will regret, and also Amazon support won't help you at all, they are even more worst üò°üò°üò°\n\n", "\n\n  One plus 7 pro is sold at a higher price and the device doesn't justify that, with no headphone jack and a dismal battey life i would suggest to wait for one plus 7. They don't include type - c to 3.5 jack connector in the box. WHEN I SAY THAT BATTERY LIFE IS POOR I SERIOUSLY MEAN IT. you barely get 4 hrs on time with the screen with 90hz, they have included 60hz option in the settings but which fool would change from 90 to 60hz ? the 90hz will spoil you and you will NEVER go back to 60hz screen. As i said the mobile overall is average not bad. They have provided a WARP charger which charges like crazy fast which will somehow 'compensate' a bad battery ?  NO  There were numerous occasions where i had to charge 3-4 times a day of heavy usage. The WARP charger charges the device to 50% in 20 min which is the only reason why i haven't gone for refund, really.As for the camera, it's 'average' for a flagship device. One plus pro are a premium rage smartphones which aims to compete with flagships, it isn't a 'flagship killer' but a 'flagship contender'The photos on bright sunlight and good lighting are good but fally horribly bad on low lighting and night time. So dismal.Some neat features in this device is that it is really smart , the sensors are top notch and detect the phone movement so scarily accurate . For example when you life the device from the table or a bed or whatever the sensors detect the movement and the screen lights up for you to check for notifications, note that this isn't because the front cam detects your 'ugly' face because the front cam is neatly sealed inside the device and it pops up when you need to take a selfie or a face recognition unlock with help of a magnetic motor. The device's screen is good not great i don't understand why there is a huge fuss around it.One more thing i have noted is that the vibrating motor in this device is very top class, they have clearly put a lot of effort in perfecting it, you can set the vibration intensity to match you satisfaction, be careful though if it is too high, when the mobile vibrates you too vibrate along with it :)I , thus conclude by stating that this device is a very 'average' 'smart' phone with a good screen which also happends to be a flagship for one plus company.\n\n", "\n\n  Bad experience with Amazon and onepluse.I have problems in touch but they don't accept replace immediately.Touch not working properly in a day 2_3 times it's automatically touch and phone start various application without any touch closing and open.

Best phone in 50k range\n\n", "\n\n  Before going to buy this product let me tell some truth... Camera is at it's worst, after buying this  phone  I got 2 updates and last one specific for camera  but still it's same as before after updateScreen quality  just like a normal lcd panel phone , I switched from pixel XL but that was my biggest mistake I can say that.Now the funniest thing is my phone's front camera taking 15-20 second to popup and Amazon tech support says that's normal üòÅüòÅ. Amazon says no return policy is there for this phone so yeah you are going to regret after buying this piece of junk, don't listen to the YouTubbers they are just paid for that. I am writing this review after 10 days of use.\n\n", "\n\n  Phone is like a brick. Very heavy. I mean you can't talk without headphones. Interesting thing is one plus calling this premium phone. They have the audacity to give this phone without earphone and any kind of adapter from type c to 3.55. Thats arrogance at it's best. Basically you are stuck and spend whole lot of money for Bluetooth ear phone. Only saving grace of this phone is performance. Ui is not great and very old. Vivo has better ui than this phone. Buy if you want to shell out extra money for simple things like adapter and all.  It is not water resistant too. No it's rating. This is my first and last one plus.\n\n", '\n\n  I am very disappointed with one plus there are no wireless charging and earphones with the phone in 53k u must go with 26k-55k vivo Samsung or apple also they giving you this standard Assesories with the phone.about hand set phone screen resolution is perfect üëåcamera is perfect and design also perfect üëå\n\n', "\n\n  The product was received in good packaging condition..

I disappointed a bit by not having a 3.5 mm ear phone jack. Coming to the story of battery life one plus 7 pro is 4000 milliamp which is having 9 hrs 45 minutes battery life where as one plus 6t is 3700 milliamp which is having 10 hrs battery life . I was disappointed with this too. I was totally stunned by the speediness of fingerprint sensor absolutely stunned .  I think everything is fine with the New one plus 7 pro and I am absolutely and delightfully enjoying the experience of New one plus 7 pro . Basically I am a movie lover. I am enjoying the HD movies like I am watching in movie theater. Dolby Atmos sound quality adds this phone to become high priority than others .\n\n', "\n\n  Definitely worth every single Penny spent on it. The display and performance are absolutely mind blowing. Camera may not be the best but it's still top class. The phone isn't as big as people would think it is. It's actually pretty sleek and feels nice in the hands as it isn't very broad. The battery performance is commendable given the 90hz refresh rate and the QHD display. Would easily last a day on normal usage. Although, Heavy users would require around half an hour of charging. Warp charge is super fast, you won't even realise how quickly your phone charges after you plug it in. Oxygen works buttery smooth and as a first time user of this UI, I'm liking it quite a lot. Gaming is wonderful too, absolutely smooth, beautiful and lag free. The accompanying phone cover is good too, it just gets smudged by finger prints though. As someone who watched reviews of different phones and was well versed with what I was buying, I'm enjoying every second of using this phone.Most of the reviewers here are complaining about not receiving headphones and extra covers and a screen guard with bubbles, it's absolutely absurd. You should atleast look over what you're buying first thoroughly, and any reasonable man would have easily found out what he's get in the box and what he's not getting. These illiterate people buy stuff without knowing anything and then expect candies in the damn box and when they don't get it, write negative reviews which influence other queer buyers. It's highly unfortunate.For all those looking for the best performing Device available right now, go for it, if you can compromise with the headphone jack (get a 3.5mm to c type cable and problem solved). Everything from the looks and feel to the performance of the phone is amazing. You'll feel that you're holding a flagship masterpiece every second you're holding this phone. It's easily the best phone in it's price range hands down.\n\n", "\n\n  Battery is a weak.. Needs to charge twice a dayAnd apps also keep crashing... In between...Thr is a bug in which lock screen ambient light won't work sumtimes\n\n", "\n\n  Didn't received Bluetooth headphone and car charger with mobile.

Go for google pixel rather than this.\n\n", "\n\n  I didn't believe the reviewers. I bought the phone. And now I don't like any other phones except OnePlus 7 Pro.90Hz - It's madness. Imagine this - Drinking alcohol is injurious to health, but if you drink it you'll feel good. Right? 90Hz would give you the best smartphone experience, but it drains some more battery compared to 60Hz. Moderate drinking is perfectly fine; charging the phone 2 times a day is fine too. (I'm a heavy user)Warp charger - Charges the phone at remarkable speeds. If you're a previous OnePlus user, you won't find much of a difference.Camera - Definitely the best, in accordance with pricing.Everything else - as accurate as in the product description.My favorite retarded reviews :*Someone was upset that he couldn't find a 'OnePlus backpack' and a 'OnePlus water bottle' in the package.*Someone was upset that he found an air bubble under the phone's screen guard.\n\n", '\n\n  I was a follower of OnePlus but after this phone I am not going to by OnePlus phones anymore.

Sound is awesome with dual output speakers top and bottom,Mobile finger print sensor is jaw dropping faster.\n\n", '\n\n  Upgraded from my OnePlus 6 just a few days back after using OnePlus 6 for about 10 months or so.Initial observation :1. QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. No notch whatsoever.3. Near Stock Android experience.4. OP is great in pushing updates regularly which is a rare thing even with Samsung\'s flagship phones.Pro\'s :1.  QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Near Stock Android experience with some very useful features like screen recorder, ability to switch between QHD & FHD+, etc3. Fast Charging (coutsey OPPO\'s VOOC Charge 3).4. Good ROM options.5. ZEN mode to log you out of the smartphone for 20 minutes.6. Full screen without a notch makes video streaming a great experience.7. Apps open fast, really fast.8. Pop Up camera is really fast during face recognition. Many times you may not even notice that the POP UP camera really came out of the slot retracted. It\'s that fast.CON\'s :1. Battery drain gets hampered if you run it in QHD with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Camera is not up to the mark as compared to OnePlus 6 apart from the options of wide angle. (maybe software update will improve its usability, perticularly while shooting videos in wide angle).3 Camera clicks 12 MP shots in default mode. Night mode is so-so but don\'t compare it with Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL or even with Pixel 3a XL. Pixel is way ahead in terms of resolution perticularly in night mode.4. Day time photos are much better when compared to OnePlus 6 perticularly where good light is not an issue. Photography during "conference" might be tricky. This is where Pixel will overshadow all other smartphones.5. This is a big phone in the territory of a tablet. Handling it might be a bit difficult for some. Single hand use is not advisable.Will update after a few more days of use.UPDATE AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF USAGE :Most of the users of OnePlus 7 Pro (as per the reviews) would be happy with budget handset like Redmi or Realme as they are either using OnePlus 7 Pro for the sake of it or to play games. Whether your handset has 2GB RAM free or not has nothing to do with the performance. What makes a difference is the availability of RAM for a perticular task. RAM management is very good like all the previous OnePlus devices.IPhone XS Max also doesn\'t give a headset or even a dongle to use it with 3.5 mm headphone jack but people do buy iPhone without thinking twice. Iphone doesn\'t even give fast charging brick in the box. When people can spend a lack of rupees for a brand why complain about OnePlus 7 Pro.Call quality of OP 7 Pro is good. Even video calling over Whatsapp and Skype is good.It\'s a pleasure using OnePlus 7 Pro for creating Word documents, PPT\'s, Excel Sheets on the go. These apps use a lot of battery and RAM. Adobe Reader is just fluid. RAM management while using these apps and switching between them is just beautiful and seamless.Will update after a few more days......As expected, OnePlus released an update on the general performance and camera issue.Camera quality is quite subjective and uncontrollable since everyone can capture an awful photo in a random scenario. Even though the photo is not quite bad technically, there is always someone giving negative opinion only for the reason that he likes more appealing photo style. Every time when there is a photo sent to us due to negative feedback, our engineers are requested to find the same light condition and object of same color and texture to simulate the photo in order to reproduce the same problem. You can imagine the time and workload needed for fixing every single problem, not to mention the dozens of photos we got from all over the world everyday. We hope you guys could understand and allow us more time keep working on the camera.ONEPLUS COMMUNITY LISTENS....\n\n', "\n\n  Camera quality is awful. Not worth buying. Can't even return the product\n\n", '\n\n  I have tried twice to explain what issues I am facing with this phone but the Amazon call centre are not accepting it.

REPLACE ME THE PHONE WITH NEW ONE OR ELSE SEND ME MY MONEY BACK.\n\n', "\n\n  OnePlus 6T was among the fastest Android ever and this time OnePlus has truly gone beyond speed to make one of the best phones of 2019.Pros-1. Display. The major pro is the damn smooth 90 Hz refresh rate along with QHD+ screen. It's as smooth as a butter!2. Ram Boost - The phone learns your behaviour like which apps you use most and accordingly allocates ram towards it making the phone even faster.3. Speed. Nothing to say about this. It's blazing fast.4. Warp charging. The phone gets charged upto 50% in about half an hour and completely in about 75 minutes.5. Completely stoked with the battery after a heavy usage of 9.5 hour screen time with playing games for 2 hours and using Netflix for 7 hours in a single charge.Cons-1. Including camera here for the time being until a major update comes our and improves the camera firmware. As of now, not a flagship camera by miles.2. Lack of IP rating, not that it matters to me. The phone's tested enough in water.3. Lack of wireless charging. Again, not felt as a con because of warp charging, but still.Conclusion: If you can wait for a while for the camera to be improved and don't mind the above cons, definitely go for it. Nebula Blue is a beauty!\n\n", '\n\n  Everything was cool but felt missing abt in box accessories could have provided type c to 3.5mm converter along in the box\n\n', '\n\n  display- 5 starlook- 4 starprocessor- no need to be ratedbattery- 4 star. more thn my expectations at qhd nd 90hzgood sound not one of d best stereo speakers\n\n', '\n\n  late Sound problem while pubg  using wireless earphonesNot problem in one plus 6t..\n\n', '\n\n  Was one of the first people to order on Amazon. Upgraded from OP6 and there is a few things for which I believe upgrading was worth all money. First, the "fluid amoled" display with 90hz refresh rate.. I tell you, if you are a gamer, you will never use a 60HZ display again. The new stereo system and the vibrating motors are good. My biggest concern is the curved display which looks nice but prone to damage. Moreover, if you play PUBG and other such games and use claw setup, the edges may be a problem and you\'ll need quite some time to adjust. Another concern is, I did not receive a splitter or headphone adapter with my box... No one wants to use a 3rd party splitter with this phone because I don\'t believe there\'s any available on the market which can handle their wrap charger. The splitter will cost around 400 INR which is OK, but them not including as a part of the box is an indication that one plus is going through a phase of transition from being a customer oriented brand towards an authoritarian like the big players(Samsung, apple etc.) I fear op7 pro is the last phone from them I\'ll be able to buy :(\n\n', "\n\n  Okay, so I will get straight to the pros and cons of this phone. I upgraded from 6T and let me share how well it stood up to my expectations in almost every aspect. My review will contain overall and a camparison with 6T.Pros1. Best display ever in a smartphone no doubt. 90hzQuad HD+ display seriously spoila you to an extent that you no longer wish to go back to 60hz.2. Build quality is purely flagship. It looks way beautiful than one plus 6T and it does feels super premium.3. Stereo speakers are a game changer. Loud and crisp noise as compared to one plus 6T and is definitely a demanding feature in a flagship.4. 30 watt WARP charge is a cherry on top. I had no complaint with Dash charge and it makes my experience even more better with Warp charge.5. Camera is very good as compared to one plus 6T and trust me, it won't let you down. Camera on 6T was just a crap.6. You don't have to even consider about performance as you know what one plus is famous for.7. I love the new vibration Moto and heptic feedback.Cons1. Battery backup is fine. For me it last for a day but considering the display, yes it may not perform well up to expectations of some people but trust me it's absolutely fine for a normal day usage.P.S. : for some peoywho are complaining that display color is not good as compared to s10+. Here is one suggestion guys. Just go to settings and adjust the display colors to AMOLED wide gamut. I can assure that the color accuracy will be exactly the same as that of s10+. I compared them side by side and found them exactly the same.Thanks and have a nice time with your One Plus 7 pro\n\n", '\n\n  Battery life is worst , worst.Edit.

An excellent phone with no bezels and the amazing screen that is smooth to work with .....Amazon thanks for delivering my phone overnight as that was some speedy work ..\n\n', "\n\n  I was an apple fanboy since 2007. I had used every iPhone that got released in the market till iPhone X (not iPhone XS).  Since I got bored with the same OS for so many number of years, one fine day I decided to try android (keeping aside my ethical reservations about it, since it was an stolen OS as per late Steve Jobs)  and bought an Android AMOLED Phone (to test whether I can thrive on android eco system) which had an on screen finger print scanner.  Strangely, I started liking that android phone  since it had an iOS feel and used it for more  than 6 months.By then I was quite confident that I can rely on an android phone without any regrets and started looking for a flagship phone that can match to iPhone, in terms of Overall User Experience. While Galaxy S10 was one of the obvious choice, I was some how not happy with it(may be due to Apple Vs Samsung Long term dispute) , but  then  the OPP7 got released. :-)I waited and bought 12GB RAM+256GB Storage Phone on Amazon. Before I bought this phone I had read through many reviews online and got really worried about issues posted about this phone,  like ghost display, Mediocre Camera, bad call quality etc etc. Also many reviews for this phone on the  Amazon ltself was not good.  Still I stuck to my decision of buying this phone and let me tell you that I am extremely proud of my decision.Once I got this phone then it simply turned out to be an outstanding phone and completely changed my perceptions about stock android experience. Now I would want to say that it is one of the best phones in the market. While there are many good features as well few shortfalls on this phone,  end of the day the overall user experience is something that I liked utmost.My key take aways about the phone are- I am awestruck with the edge to edge, QHD AMOLED Display with 90 Hz refresh rates and the curved display. You can view everything at  best on this phone.- 12 Gigs RAM keeps the phone blazing fast on all the games I downloaded, of course Snapdragon 855 is an extremely efficient CPU.- Camera: While this was one of the concerns reported utmost by all in the reviews, with the latest software update I would want to say that I could make great photographs with both  48 pixel normal camera as well as with the pop-up Front facing camera. I simply loved the pictures I took on this phone and I am quite confident that it matches to the quality of iPXs Max even at the low light conditions (ensure for latest software updates). The 4k Video captures are great delight.- Warp charge: Can't belive that it took less than hour to charge my phone from less than 5 to 100 %. I have to say Kudos.- Oxygen OS: Simply minimalistic, yet very beautiful. One Plus team has paid every attention to the detail in building this OS. All my need for using a Gesture based OS is completely taken care.- Speakers: Great Stereo speaker alignment with Dolby Atmos experience. While it sounds great, I would want to say that it is not the best audio experience. However there are no regrets.- Build Quality: Overall build quality is absolute wonderful. I loved that buttery touch whether on the screen or on the back.- Weight: That 206 gm of weight in the hand made me to feel that it is a worthy and reliable phone and not just another one of the bunch in the market.- Pre-applied screen guard: Very Happy about it. At least it is not tamper prone out of box. Same logic for the free case that ensures that my device is safe, atleast initially.- Size: While I have seen many complaints about the giagantic size of this phone, my take on it is that it is simply fine. After all for the greater user experience we do need a good screen size phone.- Notifications: Let me tell you that I am extremely particular about the efficiency of notifications from SMS and Whatsapp messages. While my earlier android phone is not efficient as iPhone in this aspect, OP7P had ensured this to me. Very greatful!!Area of Improvements- Battery life: Unless we are concious about managing battery life, it may not lost long especially with the 90 Hz screen refresh rates- No Wireless Charging: Personally I damn care about it. I never used that feature in my iPhone X. But still a drawback.- No Headphone: Exactly same as above. Something not worry much with many bluetooth headphone options. I have paired my Airpod and it works simply great.- No IP Rating: I am very much sure that this phone is splash resistant as well  water resistant for minimal time and I am extremely happy with it. After all I am not a professional swimmer with the intent to use this phone underwater. (with all due respect to the swimmmers)Few aspects about my purchase from Amazon:- Concept of guaranteed price for phones from Amazon was very useful for me. I exchanged my recently bought first android phone and got a good value for exchange- Interest free EMI and discount on my SBI card made me to feel happy- Almost same day delivery of the phone. What else I can ask for.Finally I would want to say that I am not paid by any one (especially by OPO) to write this review but it is an honest user experience by a tech enthusiast.  Still, for any questions, please feel free to write a reply to this post and I will try to respond it asap.\n\n", "\n\n  Hi Team,I would like to bring this to your attention that the warp charger is charging really slow and not at all upto the mark. I am not sure if it has been changed during delivery or it was packaged like that. Although I am really happy with the phone's performance and battery life however the charger is not upto the mark. I charged my phone with my sister's dash charger and it charged my phone almost 3 times faster than warp charger.If possible, please pass it to the oneplus team or look into the delivery process.Thanks & Regards,Sahban khan\n\n", '\n\n  Macro mode ?\n\n', '\n\n  \xa01) No wireless headset provided,2) Very poor slow motion recording.it keeps on flickering even after recording.No support from Amazon team.\n\n', "\n\n  Overall it's a average mobile,, not any special than 6t.

Received the phone in good condition. OnePlus7 pro has a Beautiful large screen resolution, great camera and incredible processor speed... Also a bigger battery backup with warp charge.\n\n', "\n\n  Dear Mr Bezos,I am writing this in grief that the product which I received is malfunction and I tried to return this product on day 2 of me buying it , but as per your amazon policy money was not refundable . Is it good to take people hard earned money and become rich with all this schemes , before amazon was never like this . You can check call records even I have contacted your company executives not once but twice. Days passed and it the 16th day of this phone the phone has an issue as when I using an app like watsapp while texting it opens the profile of the person whom I am texting , plus it opens up the the other app . I don't know what problem is this . I urged your executive even that mamm I don't require the money , I would be ordering iPhone XR but then also she said a clear no . Experience WD one plus flagship phone is getting pathetic with every passing day.Regards,A genuine customer who has been using Amazon to buy online product always but this experience made me felt disgusted and pathetic.\n\n", '\n\n  I have received a handset with a faulty mic, as soon as i m on call the person on the other hand seems to have disturbance in the voice call this happen when i m on mic as soonnas i switch to speakers it vanishes and everything works fine but the thing is i have purcahsed a phone to make a normal call not speaker call. I have been to the service store they said take the back up of the phone and hand over to us. It means that ordering the device early is stupidity. Now it can happen they will open the phone and the water proof pressure will be damaged, not happy at all.\n\n', '\n\n  Got my hands on the first prime day sale and arrived two days later.This phone is a fresh breath of air the. The OS is silky smooth  and no lag whatsoever . One plus did an excellent job with their oxygen OS with great optimization . The 90 Hz display makes the experience much more better . You can change it to typical 60 Hz for a long lasting battery hours but who cares when you have a 90hz display. Browsing and scrolling is super smooth and playing games is a bliss thanks to the snapdragon 855 SoC . Been using it for the past two days and the battery life is good . Gets you throughout the day without excessive game play sessions and the latest UFS 3.0 provides blazing fast data transfer.  I get an average of 8 hr of screen on time with full charge and speaking of charging the latest warp charge charges the device from 40 to 100 in around 25 minutes which is fast. I am happy with the device as it is my first one plus device . Looking forward to using it for more than 2 years.\n\n', "\n\n  This is my first ever Android phone, after being an iPhone user for over a decade. The device is superb and fast. Apps work like breeze and overall, Oxygen OS feels clean and fast like iOS. There are several stability issues that I've seen. Most notably, things like the fingerprint scanner do not always work as expected, the double tap feature doesn't always work and the curvature of the screen leads to unwanted taps. The 48Mp camera is pretty good indeed however, I've noticed an occasional focusing issue that prevents the camera from focussing correctly under certain conditions.But I guess Android phones are never perfect simply because their software is not particularly built for the hardware. So, I'm pretty cool with these issues so far, unless something escalates further. Overall, I'm very impressed by the device. Its well built, charges quickly, takes good photos, sounds well and performs well.What I'm more interested in seeing are these minor glitches go away with OTA updates as is popular in the OnePlus community. Apple has never been very responsive to minor complaints and their updates take ages to appear. OnePlus, from what I've heard is very responsive to customer complaints and I'm hoping things become better with upcoming updates.Till then I'm finding 1 - 2 star reviews on Amazon really amusing with people reporting things like a missing screen cleaning cloth, wireless headphones. Get a life people, and buy these on your own.\n\n", '\n\n  Great choice over S10 Plus.Amazing display and smooth experience with 90Hz refresh rate, which can only be experience while using.Battery gives more than 4 Hours of screen time with 90Hz.Superfast charging with WARP charger.Extremely fast and no log switching between apps and playing games.Outstanding camera which clicks quite decent pics in both day and night.Overall best phone from OnePlus till now. Worth purchase with no cons.\n\n', '\n\n  One plus 7 pro is an awesome phone no doubts.I am a very strong Apple fan, still i used 99% apple products.I have iphone too, but openly say compare to one plus 7 pro, i phone is nothing.Superb camera,superb perfomance.8 gb ram and 256 gb storage capacity around 52, 000/-.Both front and back cameras are awesome.Good phone for gaming people also.Good wide display.Good sound quality.Superb design.No doubts this is best phone in market now.One plus have good brand name too.What I dislike is 1.)

But I recieved the product in Monday 20th May only..it was such a very bad experience with Amazon Becz even though I was a prime customer I recieved the product very late.. I raised many issues and complaints within that date to get the product on time. I felt very bad about the delivery service of Amazon team..Note regarding the beast and flagship of 2K19.. we happy to buy one plus product again. I was already using one plus 6 for the last 8 months. Always the one plus is so fast and good in performance and built quality. The same and with more performance and balanced Battery back up in the new one plus 7 pro. The box itself was awesome. The phone build quality is remarkable. The display is the main highlight of the product such an awesome clarity and movie experience on the phone. The fast movement with 90hz is really awesome. Felt like new whenever I use the phone. Camera quality has been improved a lot. Day time the photos are awesome and the new nightscape is also good .. The front camera is better and fast. Overall I can give 8.5/10 for camera Becz there is still some lag in picture quality and the contrast of colours while taking a picture when compared to other flagship mobiles. Next the most fastest indisplay finger print is speechless.. no lag or no delay even in extreme dark.. happy that the one plus products are always awesome and they are continuously improving the products. The battery was little bit okay for me im getting just 5 hours of screen time only. But I Hope that the upcoming updates will improve the battery life. So I can give 8/10 for battery and 10/10 for performance. The animation is also awesome whenever we open the phone through finger print the live wallpaper is remarkable. Overall I'm very much happy to buy this awesome product only I felt little bad about the price and there was no connector for earphones. The price is not too high but I expected little less. Anyways this is the new beast of 2K19. Since I won't be playing that much games so I bought 6gb variant Becz last time I bought 8gb variant it will be even more faster but drains the battery fastly. So I decided to go on with 6gb. I recommend everyone to buy this flagship killer and those who will use the phone for more personal and normal use they can easily go with 6gb variant\n\n", '\n\n  A great premium flagship smartphone.Pros:üëâThe DisplayüëâSnappy UI InterfaceüëâOxygen OS (FASTER UPDATES)üëâAn above average camera( can be better with G-cam mod and future updates )üëâVibration hapitc motor feels more premiumConsüëâA bit pricy , but that display !üëâProne to damages can be solved by buying a caseüëâNo wireless charging but you do get a 30W chargerüëâNo ip water resistant although it is water proof check YouTube videos for water tests Op7pro.\n\n', "\n\n  Fastest Android phone on Earth!Samsung, Redmi, Apple, etc etc...

I didn't expect it to be this good!, I have a S10 in my home for comparison and I can surely say this is as good as Samsung'sBuild- I waited for nebula blue and it's worth the wait! It looks awesome, build quality is excellent but a bit hefty but manageable and u will get used to it in one dayCamera- this is the main part, I don't know whether it's due to my low expectations on camera due to all the negativity but I'm genuinely surprised with the camera, even for this I compared it with S10 and it's pretty close to S10, low light photography is a major improvement and it's on par with S10 which is considered as best in low light other than HuaweiSo don't believe all the negativity, I wonder people who are putting negative review are using DSLR for their daily photo needs.. the only negative would be the wide angle lens is not upto the mark and the one on S10 is way betterVery happy with the camera..Battery- way better than my 5t and easily getting upto 7hrs of screen on time with moderate to heavy usage and warp charge is the best!Performance- no need to say specially about performance coz it's OnePlus!855 with 90hz display, the fastest phone in the world!Others- call quality excellent, sound output via Bluetooth excellent, fingerprint sensor excellent, vibration feedback excellent, no ip rating but totally waterproof.Overall an excellent package and it's worth the premium price!Important note: 3x telephoto lens will not be active if the object is at less than 50cm distance from the lens and in very low light scenarios in such cases the main sensor is used for zoom for better quality...\n\n", "\n\n  I am writing the review after using the product for one week.1. Display & Hardware : That's probably the first thing you'll notice about the phone. There is a massive 6.67-inch screen. (too much for me). The design is rich and lusturous.There is an anti-glare coating at the back which gives a matte-like finish. The all-screen design makes the display amazing. Also, it is the first phone of the brand to offer Quad HD+ Fluid AMOLED panel. And most importantly, the screen is curved on both edges (like recent Samsung flagships).What makes the phone truly stand out is the 90Hz refresh rate. The display is also rated for HDR10+2. Camera : There's a primary 48MP f/1.6 camera backed by an 8MP telephoto lens and 16MP wide-angle shooter.The wide-angle lens offers a 117-degree field of view, and the 8MP telephoto delivers 3x optical zoom. And it is just amazing!! The camera is works amazing in daylight conditions. The night-mode is also good, but don't expect it to compete the Pixel 3 and galaxy S10s. Also, the pop up camera is an amazing addon!!3. Software : You really don't need the review for that.But few good things are- native screen recorder, OxygenOS 9.5, Fnatic Mode and Sen mode.4. Processing : The device is fast, really fast. From face recognition to 90Hz display to OxygenOS' clean interface. It is the fastest device I've ever used. (8/256 Version)5. Battery Life : The OnePlus 7 Pro has a 4000mAh battery, but because of the 90Hz display, I struggled to last it for a day. also, the  Warp Charge delivers a 30W charge. You'll be able to charge from 0-50% in just over 20 minutes, and up to 50% in 30 minutes while gaming.6. Weight : The large screen and the 4000 mAh battery leads to 206g weight. The OnePlus 7 Pro feels too top-heavy, and that makes the device unwieldy.7. Major Cons- too heavy, massive screen, no earphones included (paying 53k, I expected earphones), night mode camera is fairly average, no wireless charging, No IP rating , No 3.5 mm jack.Final verdict - I am postively biased for OnePlus always. But yes, since the price range has moved significantly, the expectations from the device have been significantly increased as well. Still this is one of the most ambitious phones, I've ever used. So, please go and buy it!.P.S.

You can bet on it. The Samsung S series like curves at vertical edges of 6.67" large screen and no bezels gives the phone very rich looks. By far the best OnePlus till date.The 4000 mAH battery lasts throughout the day with more than average screen time but the charging is again super quick (30 to 100% in less than 20 mins)Using gestures feels awesome and gives more screen space on already a very large screen.Camera is still under testing so no comments, however initial pictures looks very good.So for a new phone I rate it 5. Let\'s see & review it\'s performance after 3-4 months into use\n\n', "\n\n  I received a new OnePlus 7 Pro just yesterday, and when I tried to add both my sim cards in it, I found out the second sim slot was too small to add even a nano SIM card.After spending a day going from one shop to another to have my sim cut and everyone saying it was too small already, I found someone with the same phone, and they opened their sim card tray and said mine was defective.What kind of pathetic service is this?!This has not only made me not want to shop for anything on Amazon, but also has made me hate the brand OnePlus.OnePlus's call centers are also not customer friendly.I recommend people not to buy this or any OnePlus device, because in such a situation you'll eaither be phoneless (during the period Amazon replaces it) or you'll have wasted such a huge amount on a defective phone, with no help from OnePlus.\n\n", "\n\n  \xa0I got this phone on 3rd June and just within a week's time I am facing battery related issues.Do not rush into buying this phone, wait for a while more and ask other OnePlus users if they are facing the same issues.  Maybe I got a defected piece . They even refused for a replacement. All they did was a 5 minute video check where in if the phone battery drops then 5% they replace else they dont.Just go through the video and you shall understand the entire scenario.Feel as if 50k wasted.\n\n", "\n\n  Time for a 7 pro review, I have used for 14 days now, so after using this giving review. Let me tell you one plus 7 pro is the worlds first fastest phone. 7 pro gives you premium feel, display is unbeatable, look wise this is the most beautiful, sexiest beast till date. There are many Indian you tuber spreading negative reviews of this phone but I tell you if you really wanna decide by review then watch out side Indian you tuber videoes. Yes price of this on high side as compared to oppo Reno, redmi k20 pro but you have to decide if you want to save extra 6k to 8k or you want a premium feel of a smartphone. If yes this phone is for you, if you really want to save money then you can go for 6gb variant also comes with same features, but nebula blue is still sexiest colour. Camera is also damm good, battery life is also good, performance is best. I was one plus 5t user before having this phone so performance wise one plus is best, just go for 7 pro rather than oppo Reno or redmi k20 pro, I bet you 7 pro is the worth buy. You won't regret after buying this beast. This is the world's first fastest, sexiest phone. Just go for it....\n\n", "\n\n  No doubt regarding the phone's performance. However, the pre-applied screen protector is filled with bubbles and dust particles and seems like someone unprofessional has been applying these! I request you to please look into it and provide me with a possible solution as it has totally ruined the experience of owning a flagship and getting this kind of service!\n\n", "\n\n  For one I really do like the phone...coming to details the fingerprint reader is a tiny bit slow...but it has numerous unlocking options that work simultaneously...facelock is good...zone / location based is a good feature(though it's not new) overall fingerprint does not make that much an impact.Speed is good.For screen it's very good but for a gamer the buttons on the boundaries do make it a bit difficult to operate but once you get used to it it's ok.Rear camera is very good can't say it's excellent. Front camera should have had more resolution and lighting option.Battery is good for a workhorse like this if you are a gamer expect 40% remaining battery by 3 pm. But the charger is way damn good in 20 min you are back to 90%...Headphones should have been provided, but I use wireless anyways...Tempered Screen protector should have come preapplied instead of the plastic one. mine is developing wrinkles because of gaming...OnePlus phones offer lots of customisation option if one needs and knows how....have seen lots of people not using customisation at all.Overall it's a good phone and a welcome change.\n\n", '\n\n  Powerfully conceived and surely is a great upgrade for those replacing a phone after 2+ years. Processor is great, audio is loud and clear. Price is on the higher end but a worthy deal for people intense on email, social media and fast communication. Miss the 3.5mm jack or the in case wired headset but battery and display makes it up. Had it been, wireless charging could have taken this far further but love the warp charging. Fast fingerprint recognition and selfie camera allows decent face recognition. Oneplus has greatly enhanced the Android underneath. Worthy call if you need speed & quality.\n\n', "\n\n  Owesome sound by Dolby Atmos üëå, fingerprint sensor is super,fuild amyloid display is mind blowing,back cover perfectly fits.colourful theme is added including black and white themes which is superb.In built screen recorder in good.90hz refresh rate is smooth and fast.coming to draw backs there is no slot for ear phones we have to buy c type cable which connects earphones.and the screen guard doesn't stick at ends were phone curves not a big problem and the price 53k think if your phone is lost then you will be heartbroken I lost my one plus 3t which costs 30k.\n\n", '\n\n  nothing special except screen\n\n', '\n\n  First of All Amazon You might have became the worlds best company but Kindly Focus on your customer service or you will lose thousands of customers just because of your service. Come To mObile.You can see that i have 3 one plus device. I bought One plus 7 pro mirror black 6+128 model.With The use of 10 days.2-3 days normal working i am not a Big fan of Games or Hd videos or like this i just put 30-40 normal productivity apps in the mobile.After 3 days Battery starts drainning i thought with update this issue will be solved but inwas wrong With in 10 days my fingerprint was not working, And On 10 Thday my Phone Was dead. Its not even power on guys ya I said it right.Is this we got in 49000 rupees. This should not be done. Mobile Phone is very overpriced it should have At ‚Çπ40000.Now come to Customer service part,I am calling from Last 10 days to amazon Customer Care they make false promises and just do formality Which they did with me.Finally i sent my mobile on my own courier expemse to company.Thats it kindly save your money And put it on right place\n\n', '\n\n  When there is a video call camera pops up while it is ringing, it should have been camera popping up when I accept the call. This put the selfie camera on risk if the phone is in your pocket n it starts ringingCalled up one plus service centre the answer that I got was this would get resolve when there would be a software update but by that time your camera could get affected\n\n', '\n\n  This is what I am upset for Amazon product I am very irritating about this product what the hell YouTube also not working well\n\n', "\n\n  Awesome phone... I m giving this feedback after using it 4 days...Pros: Camera quality is awesome... It's rear camera is better than iphone x (I am also using iphone x)...No lag... It's as fast as iPhone x...Battery back up is awesome...Display quality is awesome...Lighting fast charging...Cons: No led notification...No separate headphone jack... Because of it's c type charging point I hv 2 purchase c type port for using any 3.5 mm jack headphone...For this reason I give 4 out of 5...\n\n", "\n\n  I am a oneplus fan (previously owned oneplus 2, 5t than 7pro) but this time I must say that OnePlus misguided about the camera, the S10's 16 MP camera produces far more better pictures than 7pro's 48 MP camera in every scenario, really disappointed with this purchase, I should have gone for the S10 instead.\n\n", "\n\n  'One plus 7 pro fast, smooth and effortlessly powerful' as mentioned, or did the phone failed to live the hype. I am among those first mortals who got a chance to laid hands on this beautiful peice of technology and below are my findings after a week of use.Pros:1: Display- One of the bet that really paid off is the new edge to edge display in this phone, no bezels, no notch on the screen mean more screen to body ratio which looks quite stunning. However I am not facinated about the full screen display, I mean, yeah it's great but you can find this kinda tech in many sub premium phones available out there. The big surprise this time is the bump in resolution, the phone now sports a  6.67 Inch, 2K+ resolution OLED Display which was long needed since screen to body ratio has increased reasonably since One plus 3t and given the price tag. Another +ve side is fluid AMOLED with 90hz refresh rate, it's not cosmetic and I can say that because I am using a oneplus 3t along side this phone and I can easily see the difference in the screen response in 7pro, the animations are silky smooth, fast and flawless. Also another unique trait is this screen has got side edge display as like Samsung's edge series. All in all the display ticks all the boxes, no questions.2- Memory and storage: I am using a 12 GB ram n 256 GB rom version, given the amount of ram multitasking glitches are the things of past. I tested it's performance by parallely running nfs, pubg, asphalt nitro, clash of clans without any hiccups where as 3t faces some issues, thus heavy performance apps can run smoothly as the phone can take that all easily. Also 256 GB storage is enough to store images, vedios and files etc, given that we are living in cloud era.3 Speed: Speed has always been a trump card for oneplus  phones, and it's the imperative reason of it's existence. Even my 2 years old oneplus 3t never showed any noticeable lagg and 7 pro is no exception. Also this time the company has introduced liquid cooling to address over heating issues faced by early oneplus phones, however I still found some heating issue while playing multiple performance games but in normal day to day use it's just ok. This beast takes all performance load with ease, so stay relaxed this phone won't let you down.Cons:1: Camera: There is marginal improvement in the camera department from 6t but I didn't found anything much as mentioned in ads, I compared the shots with my friend's shots takes by s10+ and the later one stands out in terms of quality and wide view angle. S10+ camera on paper is low on megapixels but does better justice than one plus. Night pics are a slight better I can say, else Samsung's done a good job here.2 - Pop up front camera: This point may not appease to all the readers but I am not a fan of machanized camera. Even oneplus suggest not to use face unlock much. There is also another clever peice of tech here by oneplus, if accidentally the phone drops out of your grip while the the front camera is still out, the phone will automatically detect the fall by using the inbuilt gyroscope and immediately pops the camera inside even before the phone touches the ground. However given all these corks and screwes, I still doubt the front camera may show signs of break downs in the long run.3- Missing headphone jack- While there are few people complaining about missing headphone jack, I personally don't feel it's a loss as I rarely use wired earphones and also I noticed most of my friends too use Bluetooth earphones. Wired earphones are the things of the past, get yourself a pair of good Bluetooth earphones and bingo! u won't miss the jack anymore.4- Finger print scanner- Strangely the inscreen finger print scanner some time fail to recognize if you fingers are slightly moist due to sweat.Summary- Bit pricey when compared to the recently launched oneplus 7, but in terms of features and looks it's leagues ahead not just from it's own siblings but with most of the competitions as well.\n\n", "\n\n  It's a oneplus phone and it gives more than what it has promised. The speed, options, video quality and ease of access all leaves you feeling royal.But in addition I loved Amazon service. I had exchanged my old phone for this and it was such a breeze. I faced no issues and was able to get the phone I wanted in record time. It's just 24 hrs since I first ordered the phone on Amazon and it's already set up and working as usual.\n\n", "\n\n  This is by far the best Oneplus device to be launched till date. I never had a oneplus device before. After using it for a week I came across these observations :Battery life is superb, and warp charge really packs a punch. Does 45% charge in around 15-18 minutes.Fingerprint reader is lightning fast.Rear cameras will make you forget Dslr. Low light photographers can will find this amazing. Front camera is perfect. The device is a little heavy but flaws are less when compared to other advantages. 90hz refresh rate is a boon. Actually you have to get a hands on experience as words will fall short for this beast. There is no question of lag. PUBG and other games are smooth and well the graphics is on another level with the gaming mode setting. The fluid AMOLED screen is pure joy. There is no audio jack but that's wierd  but if you can shell out 50k for a premium device then you can afford to shell out few extra bucks for a Bluetooth headset. Still going through the device features as everyday I am coming across new features which is really cool. Mirror grey looks better those who can't buy the nebula blue, go for mirror grey, you won't be disappointed.Overall the device is a beast. Go for it.\n\n", "\n\n  Really an amazing phone.You will fall for the screen itself.Bought on amazon prime sale on 16th and got it on 17th. Super fast delivery by amazon. kudos.Coming it the phone, it came with the pre-applied screen protector and a transparent case. That's a good welcome gesture. This is my first OnePlus phone coming from a stock android phone. The OOS is clutter free and experience is pure smooth with 90Hz and QHD+ resolution. With that in mind, the SOT of the phone with full brightness will  hardly reach 5 Hours. I use this preset in home as, thanks to warp charge, which charges in 1 Hr 10 min from 0 %. And when I go to office or any other, I use the FHD+ and 60Hz preset to get almost ~8 hours SOT with medium to high brightness.Basically this is a gaming phone. So you can play PUBG with no lag at all, also maxed out settings in Call of Duty Mobile.Camera quality is very promising. I used Gcam to get almost as good as pixel like shots. Day light shots in stock cam is better than GCam. Except for the consistency across the cameras. I hope OP will fix this issue with an update.Finally I would say that, this mobile is totally worth it for the price you pay.\n\n", "\n\n  Today I received the parcel intact.The parcel contained only the phone and it's charger.There was no ear phone, operation manual,I find in a youtube regarding one plus 7 box containing earphone, operating manual,two type of mob.cover.(color choice).I would like to know the reason for the missing item.Please respond.\n\n", "\n\n  I have been waiting for nebula blue color and it's worth waiting. I have bought one plus 7 pro. I have been using one plus 5 and upgrade it to one plus 7 pro. Phone's first impression is best. It's really a big phone. If you are using big phone even though you feel it's bigger. Screen is curved and glass body looks cool. Op7 pro comes with inbuilt fingerprint reader and it's quite fast. I have also taken many pictures and all the photos are just perfect. I have also played pubg and it's run really pretty well. But I am still waiting for the day when one plus roll out update so we can also played pubg @ 90 FPS. Battery life is good. Only thing I missed is 3.5 mm Jack for headphones. Other than that all the things really cool and perfect.üëå I must say if you are a heavy mobile user, or if you want to use a best Android phone or if you love to play game than this phone is for you. Believe me it's worth of it's price.\n\n", "\n\n  Worse one plus phone ever, I know so many friends and relatives who own one plus phones, and they're happy with the handset. Seing the performance and features I ordered one plus 7 pro and as a result I'm so so unhappy with it. I regret spending so much. The call volume drops everytime I am on the call (I don't face this problem with the same sim Card in the other phone) , I literally have to charge my phone thrice a day ( I mostly use the phone for calls and what'saap) , it's more like a landline to me. So so unhappy with the phone. I wish I never bought this phone üò≠\n\n", "\n\n  Amazon's blazzing fast one day delivery of a super blazing fast handset.I am in love with how this device handles every action I demand from it, and this device is worth of every penny.Have not seen such SMOOTH device, also it handles every tough processing games and performs so smooth in every aspect.Camera might not be so great but it's not too bad.Was worried about battery life as heard from other reviews, but it lasts decently long through the day, even after few hours of gaming. And that id not an issue too because there is a 30W warp charge support, which charges rapid Very Rapid.Overall this device justifies the price, as it gives smooth experience as Apple products give which costs way more.Have been a fan of ONEPLUS and finally I have their best device.\n\n", "\n\n  Mobile body is very sensitive even in two hours got lots of minute scratches while removing the back cover. Which I've got inside the box.Build quality is slightly poor. Was expecting much from oxygen os. But one plus keep normal features like other brands Asus and Huawei. & No any  advanced features which shows its something special.No microphone jack. Everytime needs to carry connector.\n\n", "\n\n  This phone, as explained quite nicely by the countless reviews, is one of the best in the price range. The camera is VERY good, although it can be improved. The screen is truly the best in the budget. And Amazon's service is, as always, top notch.\n\n", '\n\n  Take awesome phone with decent price tag.Few key featuresAmazing screenGood battery backupSuperfast chargingCurved screen for premium lookHuge storagePopup camera works as promisedScreen clarity is as good as Samsung S10+( with much better contrast)Few concernsBit heavierScreen length is bit much, wont easily fit in pocket*After recent update few issues resolved but camera quality still lacka in some department.

It was difficult for me even to think of shifting from Samsung. But since Samsung gave me a terrible phone through S9, decided to try one plus 7 pro.Superb performance.Gives me 24 hours battery. I do not play games on phone. But have a lot of calls. 200 plus everyday and many on Bluetooth. Even then by end of day 20 pc charge is left. The charger is very fast.Camera- superb. See the images. Some people said night photos are not good. See the quality of night pic I took.A bit heavy. But that's ok.Overall very happy\n\n", '\n\n  4000mah Battery falls very short when you keep your device in 90Hz refresh rate & keep Dual VoLTE on. So It will hardly last you a day (12-18 hrs max). Don\'t expect more than 3hr Screen on time.Again the fingerprint Sensor is in the display like 6t and so it is not very responsive..Worth buying or Upgrade?BIG NO!!!---Now coming to something very important that no blog or youtuber is covering because they don\'t want to be in negative books of oneplus PR persons....Cutting down the price and promoting 6T everywhere saying "9000 Discount" just before a week of new phone i.e Oneplus 7 and fooling the consumers by making an impression that the newer version will be costlier then 6t.Then launching Oneplus 7 phone at the same price (32999) and making sure they laugh on all the consumers who bought old stuff thinking they got a good deal but in reality they all got fooled by a company with #Neversettle tagline but, in reality, they "MADE US SETTLE" and left all consumers feeling cheated.#NeverSettle for OnePlus! Once a cheater always a Cheater!!!\n\n', '\n\n  Very bad service, Device started flickering after 20 days of purchase yet it was working for more then 10 days before it stopped all of a sudden, 100% Sure and gurantee that device was never ever close to any liquid, but then too service people said that device has water damage and I have to pay 17000 rs for replacing display.Pathetic and cheap style of earning more money like you earn in all different colour modules.Before I was proud to show my ohone to other people, now I got why iphones are better deal.50,000 is very hard to earn for a middle class person, I waited for this phone and buyed this phone by collecting 5000 every month from my salary of 25,000.I know phone is good, but the servie they offer is worst.\n\n', "\n\n  One plus put a lot of effort while designing the phone itself it's a beautiful peice of technology. Feels premium! The screen is just irresistible it's just wow. With QuadHD panel with 90hz refresh rate it's the best in the market now. One plus did well with the cameras this time. The main sensor the 48MP one is good after the update. But the wide angle suffers a bit in low light plus 3x zoom lens performance lies between the main sensor and wide angle. The portrait comes great out of the device. The selfie cam is good but seems to get harder on face in WhatsApp cam. The battery backup is okay considering the fact the phone has qhd screen with 90hz refresh rate. Yes we can change that for sure. The haptic feedback is just wow much better that previous models. The finger print reader is fast sometimes inaccurate but yes it's good. Oxygen OS doesn't need any explanation it's just buttery smooth. Thanks to the SD 855 and 8GB ram on my phone plus the UFS 3.0 storage throw any app on the device it will hadle it without a sweat multitasking is top notch on this set. But seriously one plus just had me on the screen and design....!\n\n", "\n\n  I have used many phones being a gadget geek. Previously used one plus 6 and now this one from the amazing team of one plus. Let me tell you if you buy this all your needs will be met and you won't be disappointed. It's worth your money.Pros.Great screen contrastAmazing scroll speed at 90 heartzGreat design and looksGreat camera with amazing zoomAmazing bezeless designGreat sound quality although some other premium phones have better like iPhone XFast fingerprint unlock better than Huawei and iPhone and miConsOnly cons I think of is little bit battery drainage but that's understandable since it depends on usage and screen runnin constant at 90 heartz with large display.Sound quality should have been little better but it do justice.\n\n", '\n\n  Highly satisfied with this mobile. You might have to adjust for a day or 2 with the weight and the size of the phone but eventually you will love OnePlus7 Pro. I had used Android , Apple and OnePLus earlier but the touch of OnePlus 7 Pro is sublime, out of the world. Popping up of front camera feels kind of creepy initially but you will get used to it quickly. After a month of struggle of selection between iPhoneXR and OnePlus 7 Pro i made the decision to buy OnePlus 7 Pro and am really happy with the result. Go for it, do not think.\n\n', '\n\n  My previously used few mobiles - Galaxy S7,S8,Note 8,Note 9....This time i have decided to go with one plus for first time, and belive me,it was a fantastic decesion.Previously i am avoiding other mobile brands ,only for displays.But this time one plus hitted a bulls-eye.Thanks to great display.I am amongst first few members to buy this master piece,as soon as it has launched and i have taken full 20 days to evaluate this mobile to write this review.As promised,delivery of mobile was superquick by Amazon.I have received this mobile,even before it was released for regular customers,and available on retail outlets.Thanks to Amazon.This mobile is overall a very good package. Display of this mobile is fantastic,with crisp and clear pictures.Though samsung displays are little bit superior,but margin is very narrow and for day today work,margin is absolutely nil.This displays donot oversaturate the images and pictures.Battery life is fantastic and last for entire day easily with heavy use on 60 hz QHD setting.On 90 hz it is little less.Battery life is definately far far better compaired to my Note 9.Camera quality needs some improvements, but i am sure that one plus will definately rectify it in upcoming updates.Already,a update from one plus has improved camera performance drastically.Mobile is little overweight and big to handle for average sized hand people,but it is matter of just getting "used to it".Once you get used to it,you will definately enjoy using this mobile and watching movies on it.Sound quality is crispy clear and battery backup is also very good,even if you use blutooth headsets.Fingerprint reader is fast but still needs some improvement...SD 855 Processor is superfast.No need to review it,as this is fastest amongst all mobiles,i have used in past.UI is very good,and you can adjust it according to your needs.WRAP charging is fantastic.You will get decent battery charge within 15 min of charging this mobile in emergency situations,though it will not be required in day today practice,as battery backup is fantastic for mod-heavy users,as stated earlier.I my opinion,compairing price to performance ratio,this moble is the best mobile to buy to date.So "JUST GO FOR IT".Now ,I became a proud fan of one plus.\n\n', '\n\n  \xa0I am giving 2 stars just because of battery and screen. As you can see in video oneplus is in overconfident while making this device. They didn‚Äôt even take care of software and camera. I just sold this phone in 10 days just because of camera quality and hanging problem.\n\n', "\n\n  Update after two weeks usage: Can't imagine life without this phone! I am now thoroughly familiar with its functions, and we get along well. The battery has stabilised, and I get 25 to 30 hours easily with around 9 hours on screen. The phone lights up on its perimeter when in lock mode and you get a notification - different colours for different apps. I have given it full marks now as it has surpassed my expectations. I thoroughly recommend this phone and consider it to be great value for money! Please hit like if you found my review helpful and let me know in the comments your experience with this phone.___This is a preliminary review after one day's usage and exploration. It will tell you how I feel about the phone and how I perceive it when comparing it with other phones I have owned. Please remember that every person is looking for different things in a mobile phone so your user experience will be different from mine.My wishlist included honest photography and videography with a clear yet deep sound, long battery life and a front fingerprint reader. I take lots of pictures and hate the overexposed, oversaturated and beautified images that have taken over the market, hence the need for honesty. I had a few phones in mind and kept watching videos trying to figure out which one would suit me best before ordering the One+ 7 Pro. The reason? The photo tests came really close to those of Google Pixel 3 and sometimes surpassed them!So here are some observations I noted down as I got to grips with my new phone:Comes with silicone case but no earphones or adaptor. Guess they expect us to have leftover earphones and adaptors from previous phones?It's large and heavy! Consequently, it gets cumbersome and causes muscle fatigue after a while (had a similar problem with Sony XZ3). I preferred the feel of the Mate 20 Pro as it was slightly slimmer and fitted better and also it was beautifully balanced, so you did not need to exert yourself to hold it. [My hand has gotten used to its weight, but I still feel a bit intimidated by its size and wonder whether we do indeed need such big screens. However, watching Netflix in bed demonstrated the beauty of its large display and the clarity of its sound.]The fingerprint reader works well and fast. Facial recognition is also speedy, but as it requires the recessed camera to work, I am not too keen on using it.Photographs were a bit noisy on portraits but looked artistic. The update fixed the noise issue BUT ruined the portrait mode that is now overexposed. Not sure why; still figuring it out. Need to test it further. The rear camera produced good photographs compared to the Mate 20 Pro, which was a fail. The S7 has more depth of colour, and a nice background separation which gives photos a 3D appearance, something the Mate lacked and the 7 Pro cannot quite achieve. (The S7 was a dynamite phone despite the skin smoothing.) [It was my stupidity. I thought like a Galaxy S7 user that if I click on the face of the person, I'd get an AF lock, but this phone has no AF lock. What it does when you click on the part of the screen is giving you the option to adjust the exposure (light or dark), so I ended up with a washed-out picture - my fault entirely! Also, in portrait mode, it has a little oblong shape that says Depth Effect. This is what controls the bokeh, and you can't do much about it other than make sure it lights up green before snapping the shot. It will light up green only when the camera is at the correct distance from the person. I suppose this is one way of making sure the subject is in proper focus. Talking of the bokeh effect, it is very subtle, unlike other phones. If you want stronger effects, photo manipulation programmes are your friend, but for me, this is good enough.]Videos on the One+ 7 Pro are beautifully stable when walking, but if you turn fast, the image blurs momentarily before it recovers. [I enjoyed using slow motion but not sure if other phones can switch to slow motion during videoing or if the YouTuber vloggers actually splice videos up to add the slow motion part. My phone can take either or videos. The slow-motion does not activate randomly as in the Samsung phones, and I think that gives you more control but, to be honest, I am still a rookie in these things.]Sound playback is excellent in music and films due to the top and bottom speakers, but the microphone can hardly pick up someone talking 1.5 meters away from you in a quiet room when you are taking a video.The display is not as great as any of the comparison phones. The icons (phone, texts, camera, etc.) are not as beautiful as the competition's. There is a poor selection of wallpapers and none of the themes. One thing I enjoyed about the Mate 20 Pro was its wide selection of wallpapers, some of which were animated. Felt so excited to hold a phone that had falling cherry blossoms. Luckily, the Play Store has a variety of free wallpapers and was able to find some that give me joy. [Once a great wallpaper was in situ, everything looked much better!]The curved edge makes the letters from some apps seem to slide downhill, reminds me of Salvador Dali's famous melting paintings. Not a deal-breaker but distracting. App developers and One+ should take that into consideration and condense their displays to leave a black gap on the edges when text is involved. [My brain learned to ignore it.]The bottom navigation bar lies behind ads in games like Solitaire - takes some skill to NOT click on the ad trying to get to the home screen, and I am proud that I have mastered it. [Should not be a problem if you are not using the silicon case. If you do have the case on as I do, learn to start the scrolling action from the silicon itself, and you won't miss.]Angry Birds Friends is not loading and constantly crashing. [Uninstalled the app as per Rovio's instructions and re-installed it. It worked until I exited. Then I was again unable to load it. This morning, it works again. Mystery!]Bejewelled Blitz was jumpy despite the 90 Hz refresh rate, and it feels laggy. Taking off the Fnatic mode seemed to improve things a bit (though Fnatic is meant to be ideal for gaming...) [Checked this morning, still laggy at 60 Hz even if all other games are closed. I can understand the screen being slow because of the screen protector causing more friction, but why is the game slow to load results? Maybe my broadband is slow at times?]Colours on apps seem ‚Äòdirty‚Äô instead of bright and vibrant as in comparison phones. Also, blacks look greyed out. [I got used to the new look of colours, and it does not bother me any more. I have even reduced the display settings to save battery as that is more important to me at the moment.]Google Calendar is more laborious to work with than the Samsung calendar as it requires to select what kind of entry you are entering - ugh! (Ease off, Google. Just let me enter it and trust me to know what my entry is for!!)Step counter kept counting up despite me not taking a single step. It just felt the vibrations of me picking the phone up and thought this was walking. Hmm... to cheat or not to cheat? [I don't really fancy walking around with this big phone, so I have left my old phone in the bathroom LOL]I did not use the file transfer app they recommend as I had a bad experience with Huawei's own and never said again. Sadly restoring from Google backup, did not restore my text messages. The other phones did, which is baffling. [Apparently, Google security does not allow a full restore unless you verify it is you who logged in from a new device, so do that first and then try the restore.]The keyboard is more accurate than the Samsung one, probably due to space, but it makes it more tedious to type as you need to move your finger further. However, it has a great feature: a proper keypad that can be activated entering a series of numbers. On the minus side, the special characters are slightly harder to get to.The final observation is that the battery seems to drain fast (very steep slope in the diagram). The battery charges fully in 1 hour 20', and despite predictions that the phone would only last till 3 am, the phone survived the night on standby mode till 6 am. Although the screen was on for about 6 hours yesterday, I didn't do much other than set it up, take a few pics and a couple of short videos and try out my game apps. The Mate 20 Pro had an amazing battery life. [The battery continues to worry me. If I need to be charging it more than once a day, then I have gained nothing over my old phone. I have now put the phone on a dark theme, reduced the Hz from 90 to 60 and lowered the resolution. I also make a point to close every app when I am not using it. I am now confident enough to say that if there is a deal-breaker for me, it will be battery life; however, apart from the 6T, most phones have worse battery life. The Mate 20 has a great battery, but the photography is ... ugh! I will try to let the battery drain and then charge it early morning and see how it fares. With light use, I would have expected the battery to last more than 23 hours :( Imagine if I start using it exclusively as I did with my S7!]Conclusion: I am not 100% convinced this phone is for me though I can learn to live with it. I know from reviews that the One+ 6T has much better battery life and photography so maybe that would be an option...? [I am so tempted to order it and compare!!!]I have just uploaded a screenshot of the battery information. It has improved. The phone goes into panic mode at 15%, but if you ignore its message, it will see you through the night on standby and give you a couple of hours light use before it truly needs recharging.\n\n", '\n\n  Bought on the first day and received in the same night in around 7hrs. Classy looks, excellent buttery smooth display and flawless performance.A bit underwhelmed by the camera performance till now. Sometimes the pictures are good sometimes are over beautified and smooth, needs retouching afterwords. But yet to test outdoors in depth.Photos attached are retouched a little.Battery seems to last a day with moderate use and occasional gaming.Phone is slightly heavier than expected or desired.Definitely worth an upgrade from 3T if you want a great display and performance.6-128 version will suffice the need of moderate users..\n\n', '\n\n  I use 4 finger claw for Pubg and at random times the screen glitches for no particular reason. There are glitches of different type:1. Sometimes the place where my buttons are on screen, they get clicked even when my fingers are no where near it.2. Sometimes I have to have a finger tapping on the middle of the screen otherwise the buttons at the top left edges wont activate no matter how many times I tap.3. Sometimes buttons wont work all together.All these glitches happen at random. Sometimes the phone will be working fine and other times it just goes to hell. So playing competitive for which I bought such an expensive phone is defeated.Pros:Camera.Dunno, failed almost all my expectations.Cons:Pop up camera.Refer Pros.With no apps running in background and only wifi on 24x7 and no one using the phone, the battery last 2-2.5 days...with no usage.

Will be the common question of everyone today who are planning for the premium smartphone, especially with Snapdragon 855 Chipset.I think many of them have already written a detailed review of this product, OnePlus 7 Pro. But in this review, I want to focus on one issue of the current people, "WHICH PREMIUM PHONE SHOULD I BUY?"Because earlier, it was a very easy task to judge the best, flagship, worthy premium smartphone - OnePlus. But now, it appears very difficult to select the best flagship smartphone. Because now we have so many options like S10, Note 10, K20, etc. to select. And even I was totally confused. But after buying and researching many premium phones, I am concluding things in this review.So now let us start to compare almost each and every premium smartphone with this OnePlus 7 Pro smartphone so that it will be helpful for you to buy the right smartphone.1) Samsung Note 10: Priced at 70000, less battery capacity, less powerful processor, smaller screen, no 90-hertz screen smoothness, no Quad-HD. So here OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner. You can choose this Samsung Note 10, only if your preference is a compact smartphone with S-Pen. Or else, please buy OnePlus 7 Pro itself.2) Samsung Note 10 Plus: Priced at 80000 (oh my God), performs less powerfully with Exynos chipset when compared to OnePlus 7 Pro\'s Snapdragon 855 processor. I don\'t know why Samsung doesn\'t provide Snapdragon chipsets for few countries for S series premium smartphones, even after charging 80k. And still same display - no 90-hertz smooth screen. And one more funniest thing, no 100% display. I mean, still, they are providing punch-hole selfie camera on the main display, whereas pop-up selfies are provided by other brands at just Rs.15,000 now. Come on Samsung! Even after charging 80,000, no pop-up camera? Kidding? So according to me, here also the clear winner is OnePlus 7 Pro. If your preference is S-Pen alone with the latest premium smartphone from Samsung brand, please go for this and pour your hard-earned money.3) Redmi K20 Pro: I have used this. By paying 33k you will be hit continuously by MI dirty ads, for a poor quality AMOLED display. I hated this. No way match even for OnePlus 7. I can clearly tell that this can\'t even beat OnePlus older smartphones. Xiaomi should realize that customers are paying money for what they are providing. Earlier the scenario was different. Only MI smartphones were very much budget-friendly and ads were accepted (that too by some people). But now, showing ads is like totally killing themselves. OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner here too. And I really don\'t see any good reasons why people should opt for Xiaomi phones anymore. Until they stop ads and spoil kids, I don\'t recommend MI phones to anyone anymore.4) Oppo Reno: I have used this too. Earlier I used to think that all AMOLED screens will be great. Because earlier, there were just Samsung and OnePlus to provide commonly AMOLED screens. But I learned from Redmi K20 and Oppo guys, that all AMOLED screens are not the same. These screens can never match even Samsung\'s entry-level smartphones\' AMOLED display nor they can match OnePlus older versions\' AMOLED displays. And moreover, what I really hated much was ColourOS UI of Oppo. My god! It is horrible I felt. According to me, here also OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner though Reno also uses Snapdragon 855 processor. Choose this only if your preference is high zooming of your rear-camera. Because Oppo Reno has 10x zoom while OnePlus 7 Pro\'s has just 3x camera zoom.5) Black Shark 2: In this 100% display era, MI, along with popping ads, is again lacking to provide the full display. This is a smartphone of having infinity display like OnePlus 5T or Samsung S8 and S9 series. So here also the clear winner is OnePlus 7 Pro. Again, I don\'t see any good reasons to go for this smartphone.6) Asus 6z: This smartphone has failed to provide the AMOLED display in spite of being categorized as a premium phone. Very surprising. This itself enough to lose the competition I guess and OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner here too. If the price is the only criteria, one can choose this unique revolving camera smartphone.7) Samsung S10: Again, I don\'t think it is good to pay a huge amount (61,900) for a smartphone with no 100% display in this era. So the winner here also is OnePlus 7 Pro. If a compact powerful phone is what you want, one can go for this.8) Samsung S10 Plus: Same goes here. My god...Samsung\'s pricings are too much I feel when compared to OnePlus 7 Pro. So the winner here also is OnePlus 7 Pro. If superb camera quality is the only needed factor, one can go for this Samsung S10 Plus.9) Huawei P30 Pro: It is a known fact that Huawei and its sibling Honor was banned by the US for spying. And Android itself was expected to be killed on these phones. Though the ban is lifted for time being, it is not certain that the ban-lift will be permanent or temporary. So why should one risk in investing a huge amount on this brand? So I feel time waste in researching these brand\'s smartphones. So I prefer OnePlus 7 Pro only here also.10) Honor View 20: Same 9th point goes here.11) Huawei Mate 20 Pro: Same 9th point goes here.12) Google Pixels: Again, the Samsung theory goes here. When the era is of 100% displays, punch-hole cameras, infinity displays, notch displays, waterdrop displays, etc. are all meaningless I feel. So my choice is OnePlus 7 Pro without any doubts.So after researching and trying everything, I strongly feel that currently, OnePlus 7 Pro is the only model which can be trusted and you get more than what you pay.Frankly speaking, initially, when OnePlus launched this 7 Pro smartphone, I was disappointed by considering the price factor and the smartphone\'s size factor also. But now after using for a few days, that too after trying all other brands, I am really feeling that this OnePlus 7 Pro is worth for every penny you pay. Even the phone is NOT BULKY IF YOU USE A RIGHT SLIM CASE.The display itself mind-blowing and everything provided in the package is very, very powerful. All the three colors are beautiful - mirror grey, almond white, and nebula blue. Chose whichever you want. And feel free to submit questions to me. I will try to answer.\n\n', '\n\n  Why just Unlock Speed when you can Go Beyond Speed.My New One Plus 7 Pro!!!The OnePlus 7 Pro\'s camera, performance, and price make it the go-to premium Android phone of 2019.Overall, the phone looks fantastic. The display is razor-sharp and thanks to the pop-up camera, it\'s all screen; there\'s no cutout tab or teardrop notch or "hole punch" dot.Pros:Notch less DisplayRAM BoostQualcomm SDM855Memory (Up to 12 GB)Primary CameraFront Pop-Up CameraBattery (4000 MAH)Warp ChargingFingerprint (under display)90 Hertz Refresh RateCons:ExpensiveWireless Charging3.5 mm jackNo IP Rating (Dust/Waterproof)By Saikanth Krishna\n\n', '\n\n  Awesome product from one plus and comes to camera quality, it has improved alot after the software update (OS 9.5.7)Only thing i felt personally as a con for this mobile is its huge 6.67 inch display which is a bit tricky to handel.Battery life is very good and lasts for minimum 24 hrs if you are using it for quite a bit heavy as well.I would suggest this mobile if you are fine and can cross over your budget.\n\n', "\n\n  This is a review after a month usage:Pros:Display- 5+/5Camera 4.5/5Touch-4.7/5Battery-4/5Fast changing- 5+/5üòúFingerprint sensor: 5Now coming to the in-depth review, first thing was the Display: Which I noticed when I opened the package and switched on the phone was the built in wallpaper animation and that's when I immediately noticed the 90 hz fluid AMOLED display's awesomeness üòçüòç. Then the next time was while playing pubg, it's graphics was simply awesomeüòç. Then again the third time I fell in love was during the display setting when we can manually tune the display colours. And I really longed for a curved edge display phone for a long time and all these features put together felt awesome.Camera: At first, I was very sceptic about it as there were bad reviews swarming around cameraüòÖ. Then immediately the phone was demanding me to update it which I eventually did , which was around 2 gb. And then I took a few picture in artificial lighting with fingers crossed but it was fine. Then post that I thought the camera was not up to the marküòµ. But to my surprise it was me who was the culprit üòú and this came to light when I took some pictures during daylight, also I'm new to the triple camera setup so I was the one to be blamed for and not the phone, then as I got a hold of it the, picture quality was getting better and better üòç. So now I can say it has a pretty decent quality üòâ though it's not in comparison with other flagships out there I'm really happy with it's images also the 3x zoom feature will shock you as there is no loss in the image quality. Portrait mode is awesome but you will have to get used to it, selfie camera is also awesome, which also gives you awesome images üòç. Gaming: I'm not s hard core gamer at least in Mobile , since this device has pretty hardware built for games I thought of giving it a try, and to my surprise I fell for it at the login screen as the animations were so pleasing to the eyes üòç and during the game play there was no frame drops and the gameplay was pretty smooth üëçBattery: since it's a heavy 4k mAh battery I thought it would last for a more than a day on heavy usage, but it's not so coz of increased resolution and refresh rate, it drains the battery a lot especially during heavy usage, but if we are not using it much the battery easily lasts for 1.5 days, plus the Warp charging, just shatters your perspective about charging, coz it charges three device  from 10-100 in shy of 80 mins which is mind blowing.Finger print scanner is one of the plus for this device coz it's blazingly fast when compared to it's competitors üëçüòçOxygen Os: I'm a first time user and to me this interface is just as smooth as butter, the feel, the response,90hz refresh rate, vibrant Display all together is simply awesome. No lags so far. Will update this in coming months.Only con was the ear phone jack , but that can be resolved using a USB c to 3.5 converters , I used ptron adapter which is amazing and you can also charge and connect to earphones at the same time üòÖ.I guess that's it for now will update on near future, if you're planning to buy this you can blindly go for it and won't regret üëç\n\n", "\n\n  I'll go through all points what's good, what's bad and what oneplus could've done better.THE GOOD-very good in gaming-very beautiful design to look at-very good & optimized software-very future proof-no overheating, throttling, etc-very good speakers (both clarity & loudness)THE BADPoor Screen protectorpre-applied screen protector is of very poor quality. It gets scratches sitting in my pocket within few days of use. I'm not sure it'll survive even a month and btw I am a person who take extreme care of my devices.Warp ChargerIt's very fast but phone feels slightly warm from back as well as front side while charging. i tried dash charger and there was no such problem. So, I am sticking with dash most times.Provided Covercover is ok. it's a bit on thicker size but not as thick as my 6t but ulike 6t dust, etc can get in this cover which is very annoying as I have to constantly clean it.Fanatic modeIt's not practical to use it as it blocks all calls, notifications, etc and don't even give us option to turn some of these things off. Gaming mode is fineA bit overpricedRobert Downy Jr, Amitabh Bhacchan, and other big stars are promoting this device and it looks like we're paying price for those big names as this device is not 14,000 different from regular oneplus 7IN-BETWEEN GOOD & BADCameraBack camera is hit or miss, sometimes it click very sharp and detailed photos but other-times it's photos are little on softer side and sometimes I felt that there's some beautification going on. But overall it gets the job done.Battery lifewith 90hz and QHD+ on battery life is average but with 60hz and FHD+ it's pretty even slightly better than my 6t, still battery life can be improved.About the sizeAlthough I prefer small phones and this is sure not a small one. It's very bulky but handling is ok you'll get use to it\n\n", "\n\n  I have been using this phone from more than a week now. Here are the things I liked and disliked:# Display is Great (but its glamour goes away after putting on a back cover, which is necessary as the phone is too slippery without it üôÅ)# Camera is not that great if we see it from the price point. I was using OnePlus 5T before this and i feel i had a better camera setup. Also, I don't know why nobody is talking about the Portrait mode of the rear camera, it automatically zooms the image 3x, making it hard to take portraits of a nearby people/objects. Also, zooming 3x makes things very shaky and hard to take a steady shot. Really not satisfied with the Portrait mode's auto cropping zoom. Similar issue was there in OnePlus 5, the first OP phone having a dual camera setup, but the issue was resolved in 5T.# The next big thing that no one is talking about in the reviews is unavailability of Notification LED. This is seriously a big turn off for me.# Battery backup is decent considering the screen size and display quality.# The phone is too slippery without a cover. The phone attracts a lot of dirt and is also a fingerprint magnet.# The company should have provided a better back cover and Type C earphones (or at-least the Type C to 3.5mm jack converter) within the box at this price.# I also purchased the OnePlus Wireless Bullets 2 separately. Their sound quality it's good but there is no sound feedback received (the connecting beep sound that you get after long pressing the button) while using Google Assistant via the button on wireless bullets. Even my wired earphones provide that feature.Overall its a good phone if camera is not a great deal for you. Though the OnePlus should have kept the starting price of this phone under 40k. Instead of wasting money on advertisement and making big celebrities their brand ambassadors, the company should stick to their original vision of providing flagship killer features at an even killer Price tag.\n\n", "\n\n  The phone is great. Few features are best in class like the display, processor, ram, sound is good but slightly tuning is needed to it, I think it is loud. Camera is good but not great and battery is enough for 1 day. Fast and adaptive os. I like the performance most. It's smooth, fast and no heating issues yet. So, for me, it is ideal phone. And really like the pop up camera, specially for face unlock.\n\n", '\n\n  Never buy this product or anything from oneplus within 8 days this phone is not working because of just little rain and now company is asking me to pay 41000 to repair it. The Chinese companies are only to loot Indian people.\n\n', '\n\n  Overall Beast as everyone says!! but few things i have noticed after usage since a week..firstly i wud say RAM is being used drastically.. just for normal usage it wud consume approx 5 to 6 GB RAM without any reason.. i dunno how does that processing work at all...and battery is drastically draining since 2 days.. earlier 5 days were EPIC.. now i really do not understand what the problem is.. as the usage is same as before. planning to get it replaced but wat if it works the same!!!Camera app is not at all good. thy really need to upgrade their software to match the market level phones like pixel and nokia.Overall little disappointed with 12 GB Beast phone... Expectations were high but lets hope for the best for further usage..EDIT :  After 20plus days of usage and 2 updates working really fine and battery issue also resolved with some apps management. Now battery works upto 36 to 48 hrs for one single charge. Will update more once after i use it liitle extensively for few more days... Stay tuned!\n\n', "\n\n  I had been using my OnePlus 3T since December 2016. The device was still good enough for my daily necessities but the battery life dropped down to a considerable extent so I decided to get the OnePlus 7 Pro. My expectations were quite high, and guess what? This phone gracefully rose past all of them. Here is my review after three weeks of usage. Trust me, I've used the stuffing out of the device in these three weeks.Desirable features :1. Display : Arguably the phone's strongest selling point. My mind was shuttling between the 7T and 7 Pro and the display is what sold by. Beautiful Quad HD curved display with 90 Hz refresh rate. Curved displays may not be for everyone, but I've condoned them since the s6 edge and hence, I personally love it. Accidental touches are also very rare (I do have fat fingers). As for the refresh rate, it improves the overall user experience and if you don't believe me, keep a phone with a 60 Hz screen next to this and you will definitely observe the difference. The screen is pretty bright and has legit outdoor visibility as well. Night and reading modes also ensure you have a pleasant experience using it in the dark. Screen flickering is not noticeable for the average user but you have the DC dimming option as well if in case you do notice it.2. Software optimization : Oxygen OS is OnePlus' forte. Undisputedly the best OS available for android. It is buttery smooth and packed with just the right amount of features. I didn't feel the need for a third party launcher. Rest assured, you will definitely receive regular software updates for three years at least.3. Performance : Moving from the 3T, this felt like riding a H2R after owning a splendour all my life. I haven't noticed any lags or stutters no matter what task I threw at it. As for gaming, I've saved it for the end of the review. PUBG lovers do check out the bottom of the review for a detailed PUBG review. Spoiler alert : it outperforms even some of the gaming phones on the market today.4. Audio output : The dual stereo speakers are very loud. The clarity is excellent for listening to media and taking calls as well. Dolby Atmos is the cherry on top of the cake.5. Camera : Many reviews said that the camera was a disappointment. Well, OnePlus seems to have fixed it with numerous updates because when I got my device and installed all the updates, the camera performance was splendid. Pro mode allows you to tweak the settings considerably. Slow motion videos are good too, though not the best. Any normal user would be very happy with the camera as I had no complaints. it doesn't beauty or oversaturate images. Initially, when I opened slow motion at night in indoor lighting, the screen was flickering and so did the resulting video. But it turns out it is not a manufacturing defect. The sensor cannot shoot slow motion videos on certain lighting conditions. But it works well in outdoor lighting. So if you try it for the first time indoors, do not freak out if this happens. Video recording at 4k;60fps is awesome too.TIP : Use Pro mode to click RAW images and then edit them on Snapseed. RAW files produce excellent details but also range from 20-30 MB per image. They are a little soft but Snapseed is all you need to edit the images.6. Network reception : Network reception and Wi-Fi speed is also much better. Internet speed is much better on this phone as compared to my older devices (3T and Mi A2 lite).7. Warp charging : It charges from 0 to 100 in just about an hour's time. And the best part is, the phone doesn't heat up at all. Only the adapter gets warm, but the phone doesn't heat up despite the charging speed.8. Design - The phone looks beautiful and feels premium. The notchless display is a treat to the eyes. I have the nebula blue variant and the frosted glass back looks magnificent. It feels great to hold and even better to behold.Well, this phone does everything you expect from a phone perfectly. So the pros list would go on and on.Could be better :Battery life - OnePlus packs a 4000 maH battery. It will easily last you through the day even if you are a heavy user. I get 6-7 hours of screen on time normally and a little over 5 hours if I do a lot of gaming and YouTube. I have my display set at 9 Hz and 1440p resolution so this does pull a lot off the battery. But considering the size and weight of this phone, OnePlus could have provided us with a battery. I did try setting the screen to 60 Hz and 1080p and it improved the battery life by roughly 15-20%, but what's the point of having such a powerful display and not being able to exploit it to the fullest?Liabilities :1. No headphone jack - When I buy a premium phone, I expect the company to at least pack a type C to 3.5mm adapter, if not a type C headphones. Come on, even apple gives you compatible earphones in the box. I spent an extra 390 bucks for the adapter. It works fine but would have been better if it came in the box.2. Tempered glass - OnePlus gives you an applied screen protector with the phone and it is good, but it is not shatterproof. When you have an expensive display, it is always better to secure it with a good tempered glass. But finding a good one is a pain. Either it has black edges, doesn't cover the screen completely, or the application process is a hassle and error prone. And they cost at least four times the amount for flat screen phones. Have ordered one from glazedinc, let's hope it fits the bill.A few perks :To make the phone look better, I downloaded wallpapers from unsplash. I also installed the flight icon pack (free version). You don't need a separate launcher for it, Oxygen OS allows you to use icon packs and it is quite simple. You can customize the icons and even change the name of the apps(useful if you want to be shady).Also installed an edge screen app. Have attached a screenshot of my home screen. Also, enable dark mode. The display makes it beautiful.Set animation scale in developer options to 0.5x for an even snappier experience.I suggest you use the fingerprint scanner and avoid face unlock as the front camera has to pop up Everytime you need to unlock your phone. Besides it is very accurate and fast too. I've disabled finger unlock animation so make it seem faster (perception hack).Verdict :I have the 8GB RAM/256GB ROM version.  It is worth the 43 grand damage. Given a second chance, I'd still pick the same phone again and I am sure you would too. After all, it won the MVP award in MKBHD's smartphone awards 2019. :)PUBG Mobile review :This is an absolute beast of a phone for PUBGM. Default settings itself was set to HDR + Extreme and it handled it very well. Constant 60 fps was achieved with minor drops to 58 and never below that. I personally prefer to play at Smooth + Extreme as bullets register the fastest in these settings (as said by professional players). I'm a four finger claw + full gyroscope player. I picked up full gyro practicing for just two weeks in this phone. Touch response is super quick and there are no multi touch issues. Gyro response is also perfect and I play with the same sensitivity as Snax. My gameplay has improved a lot with this phone. Curved display wasn't an issue for me at all. You also have an in built screen recorder that records both internal and external audio. Recording your gameplay doesn't affect the performance at all. Minor heating is noticeable after two classic matches if you're recording. 5 minutes of recording at 60fps will consume close to 1GB of your storage. I can game for around 4-4.5 hours when the phone is fully charged. There is no thermal throttling and phone's performance does not drop at all. Besides, the notchless screen improves.yoir gaming experience and haptic feedback is excellent too. If you're looking for an amazing gaming performance as a bonus, this is the phone for you. The frame rate is even more consistent than ROG phone 2, second maybe only to iPhones.\n\n", "\n\n  Honest Review for One Plus 7 Pro :It's my first one plus phone(12GB RAM, 256GB ROM) which I bought 4 months back and I am quite happy with the design and performance of it. I will try to cover most of the positive and negative aspects of the phone.Pros :1. Speed - I have used mobile phone of every company and I must say it has the best performance ever. Apps opened in just fraction of seconds.2. Display - It has been a wonderful experience of using 90 hertz display which makes it more superior than other mobile phone displays.3. Camera - Stability of the camera is very good even you are recording video in moving vechicle.4. Notchless display - One of the coolest feature of this phone is it's full screen display without any notch which gives user an amazing experience.5. Battery - Currently, this phone has a battery back up of one and a half day. Will update it after completing 1 year.6. Fast Charging - It will take your phone to get full charge from 0 to 100 percent in just 1 hour 20 minutes. And in half an hour, it will charge your phone above 50 percent.Cons :1. Quite Heavy - As I have used number of phones I personally find it quite heavy which is due to hardware they have provided. But now I am habitual to it.2. Auto Brightness - Sometimes I feel the auto brightness feature doesn't works well. So in that case I have to manually adjust the brightness. May be oneplus can fix this issue in the upcoming software updates.3. Night mode in camera - Night mode of the camera is not that good as compared to other phones. It could be more better. May be this can also be fixed in next software update.4. Price - Upto OnePlus 6T the price of the phones were nearly 35k. This is the first phone which costs nearly 50k. Quite overpriced but value for money.5. No IP rating - Although company claims that it is water resistant but ip rating must be given by company for such a flagship phone.6. Glass panel - The phone is very slippery if you are using it without cover and back panel can easily break. Therefore, I suggest to have a good case to protect.7. No 3.5 mm jack - You have to compromise with the 3.5 mm audio jack if you want to purchase this phone. I sometimes feel there must be 3.5mm jack but then I use bluetooth earphones.To sum up, although there are number of disadvantages but still this phone is value for money. I hope this review will be helpful.\n\n", "\n\n  Good points:1) quality feels premium while holding it in hand2) Superb sound quality and clarity3) Awesome display to look at4) Warp charging is much more faster than Dash charging  + battery retention time is average5) 90Hz barely makes a difference as compared to OnePlus 3 I used before this. But yes, Its indeed much more refined and smooth(still doesn't justify the price tag)Bad Points:1) The camera although takes awesome pictures, but it does get blurred while zooming and viewing the pic from gallery2) The pop up mechanism makes mechanical sound while switching on/off. At this price, it bothered me. It could have been seamless.3) Bit heavy and huge. Gives a feeling of nervousness while holding it without any case(as its made of glass body)4) front camera is average. Similar to OnePlus 5T I would say(not much difference)\n\n", "\n\n  Never purchase from amazon, mostly products are defective and mostly there is no refund/exchange also. Instead purchase from one plus store. Be cautioud, i'm the victim, i don't others to be.\n\n", "\n\n  Bought this device a month ago and during first couple of days the phone was overheating while charging. Within a few days, one plus rolled out an update and after that the issue was resolved. Speaking about the pros I would say the phone justifies its price. The look and feel of the phone is truly elegant and no words for its sleekness. Some people may find it a bit bigger, but when you are in love with tech and ready to shell out 50k on a phone, these issues are negligible.Secondly, the display is sheer beauty. It's crisp and bright, and the difference is visible!I don't use the phone like a maniac, hence I get a full day backup on a single charge. And even if you are a heavy user, still a 15 minute charge is more than enough to keep you going for next couple of hours.The sound quality is also very good, thanks to Dolby Atmos.RAM management doesn't need any discussion. One plus phones are already prominent for their RAM management.Camera quality was initially on the lower side, but one plus has rolled out an update for that and, since, the camera quality has improved a lot.Lastly, the bigger screen paves way for a comfortable gaming experience.And now about the cons:The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow than the physical scanner, but the AI will get used to your fingerprints and overtime it will automatically improve. (Faced this issue was initially, but now it is quick as a Ferrari)Absence of headphone jack means shelling out extra cash for wireless headphones.No LED notification light. You have to check your phone so as to ensure you have not missed out on something.I am not a professional reviewer but I have tried my best to include my overall experience with the phone.Conclusion: One plus has, no doubt, used 'cream of the crop' ingredients to make this beautiful piece of tech. I don't have any regrets for upgrading from OnePlus 6. After all, you have to loose certain things to gain a better one!Peace.\n\n", '\n\n  Overall nice phone.I bought it because I wanted a notch less and fully bazelless phone so I am happy with it though it slightly big.I personally recommend OnePlus 7 because of these reasons:-1. You can save 20 thousand rupees for same features.2. Size of the phone is more suitable and handy. OnePlus 7 pro has awkward and uncomfortable size.3. Its too heavy your wrist starts to fall when continuous usage.4.Pop up camera seems good but not reliable for long run.5. Warp charging is just a hype It takes more than 2 hours to fully charge.Some good things because of them I bought it.1. Best display with 90 Hz frame rate.2. Curved display.3. No notch.4. So basically I gave 20 thousand more for the sake of better or say best display in market right now.\n\n', "\n\n  The display is amazing and it just grows on you. You can never use any other handset after using this display.Battery is good for 1 and half day usage but the wrap charge is dope.Weight is a bit heavy and big screen but big phones are the call of the day so can't complain much.Design is so attractive and feels can never be backdated even after using this for 2 years.Camera specs are awesome and software is good bit with time it will improve more I am sure. Don't get me wrong it gets decent pictures and great selfies.\n\n", "\n\n  OnePlus 7 Pro is a mammoth.The closest competition - the dilemma was should I go for the pro and pay 53k or the standard version and be done within 35k or so. Both have the same heart and soul. However, a waterdrop camera is a weird prospect. That, and only that made me choose the Pro. But when I got the Pro, I realised that the screen that came with it was just fabulous. I have never seen something like this and I will not see this in any other phone this year.The real flagship - Now that I am ready to shell 53k, it made sense to rather weigh the alternatives. S10 is the obvious answer but that punch hole is a turnoff for me. And again of all the features that S10 has that the OnePlus 7 Pro lacks, headphone jack is the only one I miss. Oh, and did I tell you about the screen on the Pro.... It's gorgeous!The backroom - I have always believed that a product is a reflection of how the company thinks. Behind every great product is a group with high standard of ethics, skills and the never settle attitude. Beside Apple, I have found that in this time (June 2019) companies like OnePlus and Honor (Huawei) are frontrunners in their products as well as their vision. So go for their products. Honor does have better camera.The new OnePlus 7 Pro lacks in camera. It's the only area it lacks in. But I see promise in the brand and future updates will make it better. I believe it. The battery drains faster when you play video games or watch videos. I found my screen on time to be close to 5.5 hrs with 16% battery remaining. 20% of the time was spent on PUBG, 15% on Google Play services and a combined 20%+ on videos. I found it quite underwhelming. However, once you take a break from your phone and go for lunch or a bath, you will be surprised to see how fact it charges. 0-100 in an hour. In fact plug it in for 15mins and you will see a 30% increase in charge.Everything else works like a charm. The fingerprint sensor is great. The first few times will be erratic but then it gets accustomed to the user. Works fine from there.The sound quality is almost great. It is loud but I wished that it was a tad bit better.The Oxygen OS is doing its job as we speak. It is so natural that you might not just feel that it's not stock Android. It's very close it the stock. And it's nothing extravagant. Oxygen OS is just right...Overall, rating hereBuild 9/10 just for the lack of official IP rating.Camera 7/10 I have taken better pics from phones that cost half. Pop up camera is good.Display 10/10 can't explain why. You need to see for yourself.Charging 9/10 This thing is a monster with Warp charger. And I don't need the wireless charging.Processor 9/10 Blazing fast. Took away a point because there is always room for improvement.Value for money 8/10 the phone is great but the camera could be better. As a user, I am very satisfied. I would rather hold OnePlus 7 Pro than the Samsung S10+.Nominating the Pro for the best smartphone of 2019.Enjoy your shopping!\n\n", "\n\n  It's okay okay Phone nothing so much extra ordinary about op7pro in 50 k plus budget. For me i have used Lg v30 plus . I find v30 plus had better features and technologies than this one. V30 plus comes with Wireless charging  ,IP68 rating, quadack headphone jack. In 4gb ram it runs fine i have played PUBG in it for year long and never ever it said restarted . I found divice is beat underrated. If you are planning for same features go for it. Now LG v30 plus comes in 25 k . May be you can plan buy LG V40 plus in latest in OP7PRO budget with better features .Phone start working on itself.Finger sensor works only if you press rightly and tightly fingerprint sensor sucks compare to other flagship phone I will not recommend OP7 Pro.Wasted 50k.\n\n", "\n\n  It's been a week since I bought the phone. This phone is one of the best Android phones in the market right now.Pros1) Display is the best aspect of this phone2) Performance is pretty good3) Fingerprint reader is very quick4) Dolby stereo speakers is really good5) One thing I noticed while playing Asphalt game for over an hour is that phone didn't get heated up too much6) Battery backup isn't bad. Warp charge helps in quick charging of the phone for extreme usage7) Response time of front camera is pretty goodCons1) Phone is a bit bigger2) No 3.0 mm audio jack which could have been compensated with bullets wireless earphones given the phone's cost3) Camera hardware might be really good but camera app certainly needs improvement. This is my opinion after comparing images taken with S10, S10+ and also given that OnePlus ran ads claiming OP 7 pro being used in multiple photoshootsThis phone is really worth the cost except for the camera app which I think will be improved with the upcoming updates.\n\n", "\n\n  Well what to say, Oneplus has killed it its own legacy. Previously known as flagship killer for better pricing... But now meh... Looks like Oneplus is trying to go as the likes of Samsung, and Apple of being EXPENSIVE. Overall i liked the performance, it's crazy fast, 90hz refresh rate makes the overall experience much better. Charging is super fast but, but the camera could have been much better, day light photos are good but when you try to take videos with the wide angle camera, it crops the frame. Performance is top notch, display is only thing I bought this phone. Super sharp and crystal clear QHD+ Oled display gives an immersive experience while watching videos and Netflix content. But battery life should have been improved from its last counterparts. On paper its 4000 mAh but because of the display that consumes more battery, it last atleast a day barely. Oneplus need to provide some serious updates for the existing bugs and need to improve in camera department.\n\n", "\n\n  Its a beast machine to be honest. more satisfying than what i  expected.it works smooth as a butter bounces when you swipe that show's how smooth it operates your every processor in a quick and promptly ways. Really worth it.what made me dissatisfied was they should atleast provide the music jack adopter were you paying 48,999 for the machine.rest everything incredible and suprisingly unexpected.charger works like it's only made for quick charging as hell.charges my battery from 1%-100% within 70-80minutes and make me use for 2 days when not on over using.\n\n", "\n\n  I love this mobile because it fulfill all of my requirements.I loved haptic feedback feature given by oneplus and during games like pubg it gives amazing experience.. Thumbs up for this. This device is beast for gaming.but there are some issues with this mobile..1. Camera quality is not satisfactory according to there price range.2. Too much heavy but comfortable in grip or in hold.3. Fringerprint sensor is fast and efficient but sometimes it doesn't recognize or takes time to open mobile.\n\n", '\n\n  I am very much upset at the phones working. I have used one plus  3t, 5,  6, 6t but unfortunately this phone when in landscape mode blank screen is showing.  Being number one e-commerce site has to check in all parameters before despatch as customer buys only on name AMAZON  tag.  The set has to be replaced or repaired at doorstep by One plus. They have to sell genuine products when competitors increase\n\n', "\n\n  One plus 7 Pro. An amazing phone. A real good upgrade from the Samsung galaxy phone which I was using for about 2 year (s7 edge). It's way ahead of these Samsung crawlers in terms of speed, performance, aesthetics, versatility and price. This phone is for power users. Very fast touch experience. Really fluid display and cool on eyes. Camera is excellent especially for low lights. There are lots of aspects yet to be explored but one thing is confirmed. This phone is a quantum leap in terms of speed and response. Too good.\n\n", "\n\n  My previous device was Vivo V9.  I start regretting from the first day of V9 and then I made a promise to myself to never purchase a Vivo or Appo device.Finally, after a lot of thinking, I purchased this with my tight budget but I never regret this decision even it costed me a fortune.Pros:-1. Fastest, never hangs (except for the 2nd day of purchase, which usually happens with oneplus).2. Display is the best thing about this device. I can't get over looking the screen and my gf feel jealous of it.3. With 90Hz refresh rate, phone looks much faster (well now I hate using other devices, they seems too slow).4. Rear camera is good, works well in day as well as in night with night scape mode (though night mode is pain in the a..)5. Phone looks and feel very premium.6. Fast charging with Wrap is lightning.7. Software is the next best thing9. Loudspeakers are really awesome.10. Screen finger print gets faster with day to day uses, Haptic Vibration is very good, Alert slider is very convenient.Cons:-1. Front camera is poor but this is expected from a pop-up camera.2. Battery backup is very poor and worse if you use 90hz with UHD display.The only thing I'm disappointed from is the price drop. It hurts like hell when you purchase one on the actual price and few months after it gets discounted. Price should be constant on oneplus devices.\n\n", '\n\n  This is the best phone I ever had from one plus. Following are the pros and corns. Let me start with pros followed by corns next :Pros :1). Best in class display.  It has overtaken even the Samsung phones. However it‚Äôs AMOLED panel is made by Samsung.2).  Best camera experience. Better than Samsung S10.3).  90 Hz refresh rate on the screen. First in its segment.4). Dash Charge :  hi speed charging, achieves 100%  within an hour.5). Battery lasts for more than a day for medium to heavy usage with data on.6). Does not heat up so it‚Äôs predecessors as it comes with liquid cooling panel. Ideal for heavy gamers.Corns :1).  The device is very heavy it weighs around 210 g2). Very slippery in nature Due to its glossy finish. Back cover is must.3).  Does not fit properly in your front pocket Due to its oversize.4). Though it is made out of glass, it does not support wireless charging.5).  Does not have 3.5 MM audio jack. You need to connect wireless through Bluetooth device or through type C wired headset.\n\n', "\n\n  I'm upgrading from the one plus 2 and this phone is beyond what I expected of it. It's fast! The 90hrz display is butter smooth media consumption is a breeze thanks to the bezelsless display and the Dolby speakers which are loud and clear even outside. The performance is simply the best! No issues here whatsoever. Battery life could've been a bit better but it's completely acceptable due to the fact that it's powering a Mammoth of a screen. I'm close to getting 6.5 hrs of screen-on time and can get through a day with 10% at the end of the day with my usage. Camera is great it may not be as impressive as the pixel but it comes damn close I hope this will improve over time with software updates. If you're confused about picking this or the standard one plus 7 let me tell you I was too in that spot. But took the plunge and got the 7pro and after using it for over a week let me tell you the extra you spend on it is absolutely worth it the screen alone is enough to blow your doubts away. Unless you're strapped for cash consider getting the 7pro its worth it.Summing up:Pros1)Screen2)Dolby speakers3)Performance4)Price (still cheaper than other flagships)5)Premium Build.Cons1)Battery (Although acceptable for me, heavy users might find it lacking.)2)No Headphone jack or headphones provided. (shockingly no converter provided either.)3) camera (don't get me wrong it's perfectly good enough for average people and not a deal breaker but it's just not as good as the pixel.)\n\n", "\n\n  Everything is ok  but its camera doesn't meet the requirement.. i can't tell its 50k+ device with this rubbish camera quality ..toooooo soft images ..no sharp image and less detail in camera.  Front camera is not usable ..too low quality..Even redmi note 7 pro has more detail than this camera .. this phone made fun of me among my friends in camera department.Fix the camera one plus\n\n", '\n\n  Phone is good except the feature hyped like Camera and Speed. Picture quality is not so great as expected. Also the finger touch screen do sometime have issue. Last 3 days phone has started hanging / getting freezed for sometime inpite of 12GB RAM and 256GB memory. Miss my SAMSUNG features where the phone can be handled with single hand. Also for calling from second SIM dialing is must to dial from  Primary SIM first and then again from called list can dial from second sim\n\n', "\n\n  Review after using the phone after 12 days.Pros:1. Beautiful display without notch/punch hole.2. Easy access to older phone stuff (basically setting up this phone was insanely easy with all the ways offered to sync your data)3. Fingerprint scanner & face unlock is super quick and secure (couple of my friends actually tried to unlock my phone with my photo.. didn't work lol)4. Audio quality from both stereo speakers and earphones in amazing.Cons:1. No 3.5mm jack or even a convertor pin out of the box (which is huge for me, I'm still stranded as there is no stock for the convertor on the official store).2. Phone is massive, just about fits in my jeans pocket.Still working on more points, the above are just from top of my mind\n\n", '\n\n  This phone is at its best , no complaints apart from the camera which is a software issue and not a hardware (this can be fixed). . Many have hate comments on this phone but truth be told, they are just mindless people who bought a product without even understanding it...

I purchased it on 28th May as soon as Nebula blue was available. Honestly saying, I'm using galaxy notes since the launch of NOTE 1. I NEVER thought of opting out of note series. But believe me I have never used such a beautiful phone in my life. Although I have paid 50k bucks for previous phone.Keeping all pros and cons aside--This phone is A BEAST!! My favorite think about this is-- Warp charge!Com'on NO phone ever charges in less than an hour but it does. Whenever I go for bath it charges almost full and battery draining is not quick even if I stream live matches. Gone are those days when We had to worry about powerbanks charger plugs etc. I don't know about other reviewers, but for me it's totally worthy to spend 50k on this masterpiece.\n\n", "\n\n  The blue beast.Everything is great.They should have included the the headfone adapter.Stop complaining about the weight even iphone xs max weighs 208 gms.Night scape mode in this phone is just superb. Better than iphone or galaxy s10 plus.And this phone is a performance monster.Chose this phone over galaxy s10 plus and I have zero regrets.Go for it and you'll not regret.\n\n", "\n\n  Had the 6t before this and wanted to check this phone out for it's 90 hz display and QHD+ resolution. It turns out the hype is real and once you start using this display, it's hard to use the one on the 6t or any other phone (60 hz I believe). You can actually tell the difference.The all-screen no-notch display is excellent and with 516 ppi, the display is very sharp and the performance is super fast. (I got the 12/256 version).Although you can turn the display back to output 60hz, you'll get so used to the 90hz that you'll have a hard time adjusting.Got it on the Diwali offer on Amazon with quick and damage-free delivery.Don't really use the selfie camera much on any phone, so can't really comment on that. But it does help that it's hidden on top so that you get a notch-free display. Can't comment on the back camera either as I'm not really a big photo-taking person.Should you get the 7t Pro instead of this? It depends, if you just want the McLaren edition or the 855+ chipset. Otherwise, this is an amazing option as it released just four months before and at the current price for the maxed out 12/256 version, it makes a lot of sense that you go for this.\n\n", "\n\n  I had purchased one Plus 7 pro 8 GB Almond color from Amazon based on a friend's suggestion but totally regret the purchase. I'm a new user for One Plus & previously owned Apple, Vivo,Letv, Coolpad, Samsung, Honor, Motorola,Xolo,etc.,never experienced such an awkward performance in those mobile's. Spending half a Lakh Indian rupees on this mobile the File manager videos file's takes time to load in order to open the same, While on call second call gets answered automatically, Both front & Back camera clarity are not up to the mark & there are lots of other issues while using the mobile I'm not at all happy using this device & feel like exploited for buying a premium range mobile with a basic mobile's performance. Need a solution for the same at the earliest.\n\n", "\n\n  Amazing performance. Gamers are gonna love this phone. I can't believe how incredibly fast the fingerprint scanner is.When it comes to camera, no words can explain its potential. With the right knowledge of photography you can capture amazing shots. In the pro mode it provides great features where you can control the shutter speed, iso, manual focus. You can check it out in YouTube.Coming to the display its very smooth. You can only feel the difference when you have been using your phone for a couple of days and then try to use your old phone.Battery life is good. But not that great. The 90hz drains a lot of battery.Theres tons of other things that make this phone great. Or else why do you think I would be typing such a long review.So guys, if you have around 50k budget, trust me, this is the one.\n\n", "\n\n  Seriously i bought this phone because i thought one plus is a true premium phone and one plus 7 pro would be a new flagship killer.

Sinse last 6 years I am using Samsung S series and still have my S8 as my secondary backup phone. No doubt the phone is good, fast, speedy, great display. I am not regret as its best value for money when hardware, performance and price considered. All these below points are just I dont like, there are lots of other things which I like as well.1. The phone is heavy and big. 207gram feels like a brick. If you fill-up a phone with features but still form factor is not practical use then this is a fail. UFS 3.0 storage only have write speed of 229MB/S, this is lower than some phones with UFS2.1 example: S10. The phone design is common and looks just like other Mi, Vivo Oppo phones. No X factor. In my view its a premium Chinese phone.2. Camera is a myth. Sony IMX586 is a failed and over hiped sensor in its era. Now a days used in mid range Chinese phones. I wish OnePlus should have skipped this one. If camera in a phone is your primary requirement then keep away from this. I love photography and have my DSLR for that so I dont trust any phone camera or that was not a concern for me. I have tested in all conditions and sorry to say this is a bad camera for a flagship. Front camera is good enough and I like it including its design. I recommed that please turn of scene recognition, auto HDR in camera settings menu to click at least some good pictures in day light. For night or dark light camara is good I believe. I assumed that the developer team put their entire efforts to bring a camera which can provide good photos in night and forget that we take most of the photos in day light. So those night calibrated auto settings will ruin your daylight photos. But still even if you try to get best shots, its far behind Apple and Samsung Cameras.3. Oxygen OS is good and fast I am using 1st time, but it doesn't have native apps like Email Client, Music Player, Payment App, Security App, Calendar, Contact, Phone Call and so many others. For all these it's depending on stock Android. Now you say whats a big deal? Apps are available in playstore for free to download. But I think those free application are comes with lots of advertisements, notification and even Google native apps track you for their add selling. I use yahoo mail, why I will pay yahoo 350 rupees monthly to use their email client. Another thing I noticed that Home bar doesn't auto hide during keyboard popup so I accidentally click the home key many times during type and suddenly go to home screen. That is a big drawback. The home bar should be hide during type. OnePlus please look that simple but very useful stuff.Rest assured, I also agree with others that its an insanely fast phone. Battery is best in class as per my use. This is a good phone and would be best if Oneplus taken care of some useful requirements. A great Display and good hardware will not certify a phone as a flagship. There are lots of other aspects need to be considered. This phone doesn't fulfilled my criteria of a flagship however personal choices may be different by individuals.\n\n", "\n\n  This is my first phone in the premium category and I'm glad I went ahead with investing those extra 20000 rupees for a phone. 12 GB of RAM will look after every thing that you can ever ask of a phone. I had no idea of what difference a screen of 90Hz refresh rate or 60Hz meant. But after using this phone and having seen my friend's 6T I can say that a 90 Hz screen is so buttery smooth that it spoils you. Fingerprint scanner has gotten better with every touch. Battery performance isn't too great but it does charge lighting quick. The curved screen and the Fluid Amoled Display just packs that final punch.It's not always we think of going for a 50k+ phone and if you're thinking of upgrading your phone and have the budget, go for OP7Pro without any apprehensions.Edit: I'm no pro photograper but the camera seems to be better with additional features after the Android 10 update.\n\n", '\n\n  Good phone. - Review after usage for a week.Best Full screen display i have used till now. Soo smooth(90hz refresh rate is a killer one).Camera is pretty good than the other mid-range phones (15 to 25k).Battery performance is nice. got full day(morning 9am to night 11pm) battery with single charge. (Since it is a new phone im spending more time with it, still battery is preforming nicely. im getting up to 7 hrs for screen usage time, with regular usage of whatsapp, instagram, facebook, insthorts, camera, photos, google news, Pubg(2 rounds), youtube (up to 30 mins), phones call of upto 20 mins) - Refresh rate - 90hz.\n\n', '\n\n  I always have avoided oneplus so far just because how they call themselves flagship killer but yet miss on so many items, but with pro version oneplus has upped the game this year giving a tough competition to all the other flagships put there.Pros at a glance1. Worlds first phone with UFS 3.0, the phone is stupendously fast.2. QHD Screen with 90hz refresh rate, a very first on oneplus device. Once you get used to 90hz display all the other phones will be a joke in terms of scrolling performance.3. Great camera. Camera is great , though not to the level of many other flagships its great and there will gcam mods which will improve the quality.4. Stereo Speakers, again a very first on oneplus device, excellent quality.5. SD855 onboard.6. Warp Charge at 30W is sufficient enough to compensate the battery performance with 90hz displayCons at a glance1. No headphone jack.2. No type C to 3.5mm cable atleast.3. The phone is heavy.4. No OTG adapter.\n\n', "\n\n  One of the best screen I've seen on a phone. Camera is brilliant, even in low light. Was skeptical initially due to some bad reviews, but contrary to those I don't see any issues so far. Been using for four days and tested out most of the features and loved almost everything about the phone, except for the weight. Battery life with 60Hz at this resolution is quite remarkable. 90Hz pushed through a day, but on 60Hz it's a breeze for day and half. I did notice few software glitches after the latest update while sharing cam clicked images via WhatsApp, but was fixed after a reboot. So no complaints there as well. Overall, find it worth for the money paid.\n\n", '\n\n  Ordered the phone on 16th.In love with the phone!THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SPEEDY DELIVERY. GOT IT DELIVERED AT 6:30 AM NEXT DAY!!!Yes it is little bulky and huge but i dont think any phone having more than 6 inch screen can be used by single hand.I have comparitively large hands and still 5.5 inch screen handling was difficult.Charging and phone Speed is Blazing fast. And display is beautiful and buttery smooth. Dont think any phone has this smooth touch!It lived to all my expectations and was worth the wait.My friend used my phone for a while and bought one for himself too!Highly recommend the phone to people looking for flagship phone.Remember, it is flagship phone with amazing hardware and features and hence the price. :-)\n\n', "\n\n  Oneplus has really gone and done it this time around. So here's the review - Display - 10/10 (This is by far the best display in the market. Take my word for it  no youtube videos can show you the smoothness  that its 90hz display provides and is also a HDR 10+ display) Design - 9/10 ( The edges weren't really required but the still look really good) Battery - 7/10 ( the 90 hz display sucks alot of juice) Gaming - 10/10 ( by far the smoothest gaming experience i have had on a mobile device. I also own an iphone X and its even smoother than the X in gaming)All in all my only problem was the lack of a headphone jack and rest i am really satisfied with the purchase.\n\n", "\n\n  S10(+) vs OP7Pro.. I chose this since it's superior in the OS, Warp charge, SD855 gaming and few more. It also matches up with its OLED display to the major flagships out there. Battery life looks good on my device atleast, Charges blazing fast. UI with this display is buttery smooth. These pop up cameras are fun and sturdy. Fingerprint reader feels faster over the OP6t. Camera quality is not up to the DXO mark, but would be improved by software updates which are seamless on 1+ devices\n\n", '\n\n  Two days as of now, simply best resolution yiu can get, will get a feeling of using 2phones, damn similar to s9plus edge.Well done ome plus. Camera has been improved , and yeass Nebula blue is the sexiest and the most unique color u will see.Feature wise, as they have mentioned its completly worthy.Just a upsetting about the potrait rear camera, hope they solve in update.\n\n', "\n\n  The first time i bought OP7pro. I was shipped with a defective unit. The screen had burn in issues. I just don't get it. If i am the first owner of the phone, how can it have screen burn in. It is something, that develops gradually on prolonged use. Maybe they are selling refurbished ones in offers. I filed for a replacement. And its working great.The phone is great in all aspects. Just the battery time is a bit less. My unit also registers false touches while charging.The design is fabulous and fragile. ‚úåÔ∏èUpdate-Initially I gave it a 5star rating, then reduced one for the 3.5mm jack and battery.\n\n", "\n\n  Finger print reader is buttery smooth , camara quality is good but not excellent needs some more improvement. 1and half days of battery life. It depends on how you use the phone. If gaming is your priority it is smooth and fast but battery won't last long. Warp charger is fast . While charging phone heats up and automatically cools down at a percentage. By keeping in 90 Hz and resolution to auto switch it saves battery.The main flaw is no 3.5 mm jack, no type c to 3.5mm adaptor provided in the package .  Tempered glass not available for the phone in their website too.( If they are releasing a phone they should have accessories too but in OnePlus all accessories are out of stock). Price of the product is high. If they are pricing high they should have provided the adaptor for 3.5 mm jack , tempered glass and headsets in the package .\n\n", "\n\n  It is one hell of a beast.. and icing on the cake.. it's got 12Gigs of Ram..!! Great Camera.. gets better with every update.. Gaming is next level.. Pubg, COD, Asphalt you name it.. plays crazy with zero lag and Hdr.. Battery 7-8 hours on heavy usage.. but, that doesn't matter when I can warp charge it to 75%  in 30 mins..!! Hence 5 stars.Oxygen Os.. refined and customised for daily use..Display is a whole different story.. beautiful Amoled display.. for movies or Netflix.. no drop in framerate whatsoever.. It's a beauty..!!If planning to get it just go for it..!! Highly recommend it !!\n\n", '\n\n  used for a weekPros :1) specs2) speed3) displayCons :1) display is too long , a feature like "bring the display down while double tapping home button" is needed2) volume up and down is sturdy and slow , i have to install a android app for controlling volume now3) no headphone jack, no HEADPHONE CONNECTOR also (i have to buy new one)4) phone lags on usage while warp charging.5) fingerprint reader works great for my right thumb , but for other fingers i have to try 3 times\n\n', "\n\n  It's a beast.Exceeding all your expectations.Worth every penny.Jus hooe you may secure the phone.There's a pre installed screen guard tepered glass.Such a goot battery backup with the best charging speed.I recoreded on my watvh it have 38 mins for full charge frome 20%Camera is just worth it better than googlepixel just a bit down in protrait.Only drawback is you don't get earphones. Which OnePlus should have given in this pricerange.Hiving 5 stars on the basis of using ohone for 3 days.Worth it.\n\n", "\n\n  This was a great deal offered by Amazon. The phone quality is top notch. 90hz screen refresh rate gives a buttery smooth experience while using the apps which support it. In-display fingerprint reader is relatively fast and accurate. Haptics is improved and precise but not as good as iPhone which is a lot more expensive.Battery life is not awesome but decent as it drains out faster when the phone is used heavily while playing games. Although the warp charging does really help out here. The phone charges upto 50% in under 20 mins. This 50% lasts quite a while when used judiciously.Camera quality is decent again. Photos come out crystal clear and sharp in good lighting. Night photos are not very clear and have a lot of grain. Inbuilt night mode provides a brighter image but still there's grain visible in the photos. Selfie camera is also good. There is the motor noise when the selfie camera pops up and down. I dont recommend using the pop up camera for unlocking the phone.Considering the price, I would recommend this phone to anyone with this budget. This is 2019's best phone afterall.\n\n", "\n\n  This phone is awesome, but I can't really use my headphones right now because I didn't get a 3.5mm to USB Type C cable. I tried buying it on the OnePlus official website but it is out of stock.The 90Hz refresh rate and everything else about this phone is fantastic.I bought the 12GB variant and I guess it is completely worth, since it gives a tough competition to premium flagships of Samsung and Apple.I play a lot of video games and I find this phone perfect for a person like me.While playing heavy-duty games like PUBG or Fortnite, the battery drains a bit fast but you can charge it from 0-100 in an hour.The screen is really huge, and because of its features I guess the phone weighs a bit more than other phones do.I would definitely recommend buying this phone to my friends or colleagues.\n\n", '\n\n  This is my biggest mistake to buy Chinese Mobile phone.In future I will avoid to buy any Item which is belong to China as China has attacked on my nation and my countrymen and brave soldiers are martyred for the pride of my nation.I would request Amazon to avoid selling of chinese product in India to respect our National emotions.Request to all other Indians not to Buy Chinese Products.Nothing is important than National Pride.\n\n', "\n\n  The phone is absolutely FANTASTIC! Works like a charm. The best thing is the display! Nothing comes close to this!A few cons I noticed are:1. The phone is kinda long from the usual ones.2. It's heavy (especially since I jumped from Oneplus 3 - 150g to oneplus 7 pro - 200g)4. The case that comes with this is slippery so better to buy a new one. I'm looking for one now too.5. The battery seems to go down a little faster to my liking with the 90Hz on. I haven't tried 60Hz yet thanks to the WARP charger.\n\n", "\n\n  Just one word . Amazing.  The speed is terrific and the response from the insane machine is mind boggling . It switches from tab to tab like lightning . Front camera is a pop but have no fear.  It's well designed and has fall prevention sensor . Phone doesn't have headphones slot and hence need to use wireless . Sound and video clarity is beautiful . I would suggest this phone to people like me who still believes in Android and for the love of Goodies it offers .\n\n", "\n\n  I am very happy with the product. But what's the meaning of phone without headphone jack or connector. If we are buying the phone of 50000, the company cant even provide us the connector for earphone? I would suggest not to go for this phone until and unless they have a solution for this. Before buying this phone just think why didn't they provide Type C earphone or connector. If we are spending more than 30K on any phone. We expect all accessories for the same.\n\n", "\n\n  It is my costliest ever phone and while reading couple of reviews, I was a bit sceptical on ordering.But finally ordered and a big surprise. I live in tier 3 city and the phone was scheduled to be delivered the very next day. Such super fast delivery has never been heard. I was able to reschedule the delivery date easily on chat with customer care executive. Excellent.. Pros .1. Outstanding display. The quality of the display can not be told in words . It has to be experienced to feel.2. Camera quality. The default 12MP pics are sharp and feel life like. The 48MP in Pro mode is somey out of this world.3. Battery. The 4000 mAh battery is more than enough for a normal user ever at QHD and 90 refresh rate. If you need to last longer, just reduce the screen resolution. The battery was 67% when I received the phone. Even after 1 system update install, 20 app updates from playstore, and setting up the entire phone, the battery stands at 31% after 17 hrs of starting the phone for first time. Great.4. Hardware. The SD855 is more than sufficient for most users while perfect suited for a heavy user.5. Warp charger supplied with phone.6. Thick transparent cover supplied and has cuts at right places which don't obstruct the moving front camera.Cons1. Pricey.2. The pre applied screen protector is good for nothing. It already had bubbles in it and within 6hrs of receiving, it had worked loose from all 4 corners. It won't last long and will surely peel off soon.3. Nothing supplied. At 53k, leave a wireless headphone, it doesn't ships with even a wired headphone.4. Packaging could've been better while shipping a 53k phone. Even a 200 Rs phone cover has better packing. No bubble wrap to prevent jerks and shocks. Just a Amazon branded cardboard and nothing else.Desired.1. Wish it had shipped with a wireless headphone.2. A pre applied 3d tempered glass for better protection.Update. All this is rubbish. The phone has developed a fine green line at the edge of display and within 4 months of purchase, the display nuas to be changed. And as always, service center terms this as physical damage and refuses to honor warranty.Never ever buying OnePlus. Even a phone worth 4000 doesn't has problems in 4 months.\n\n", '\n\n  Feels very premium to hold and the 90 hz refresh rate is just too good.. feel like its a bit over priced.. and for those who expected 2 cases and wireless earphones, its a special review package which is clearly told by the presenter.. there is no earphone or even 3.5 mm earphone adapter which should be bought from after market.. All the functions of the phone works like a breeze.. no issues so far.. overall its a good phone..\n\n', "\n\n  The OnePlus 7 pro is a large phone at 6.7 inches. It is heavier than you'd expect and is a little difficult to use single handedly. The bezel less screen sometimes makes it hard to use gesture navigation. Besides this there is literally nothing to complain about. The phone is incredibly fast, the display is incredibly satisfying, the camera is great even if it isn't the absolute best, and the UI is brilliant.Recommend to anyone looking for a phone in this price range if one handed use is not a big concern.\n\n", "\n\n  I am writing this review after using two months , and using means playing pubg , listening music, 52 apps running in background i.e heavy usage of 8GB RAM. and I would say Phone is awesome with good battery life and i won't feel bored while using 90Hz refresh  rate with a crisp 1,440-pixel resolution.By refreshing 90 frames a second, things like scrolling through web pages and apps feels really fluid.So, here are my perspective :Advantages :1. Photos are clear, bright and vibrant and I'm impressed with the camera's HDR rendering.2.Buttery smooth and notchless 90Hz display.3.thanks to Oneplus for giving Wrap charger which charges the phone Superfast 55 mins.4.Talking of durability, there is Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back, but please have a screen protector .5.There is no heating issue while playing games or charging the battery.6.Over all Build Quality is premium , but slight slippery while holding it .7. AMOLED display which is very the best at this price range .Disadvantages:1.Questionable pop-up camera durability, mechanics is good but i really don't know what will happen while keeping in pocket or while taking pics outside.2.there are Dolby powered stereo speakers that output rich audio but no head phone Jack which means either u need to buy blue tooth headphone or a usb type c connector to headphone which is easily available in amazon (but can buy in cheap rate @ 59 outside ).3. Phone is Big and Bulky (which is manageable as it's a metal body).4.No water resistance rating ad wireless charging, which according to me is not required as it gives u an Additional Warranty of One year without extra charging  . No Mobile Company provides us 2 year of warranty .Hope this will be helpful , I would suggest just go for it who are the heavy user and don't want to purchase phone every year or who got annoyed of unusual notification from OS or pre-installed apps as It's a Nearly stock Android .\n\n", "\n\n  Great phone and awesome performance.. Tested it with all kind of games and applications... Now without wasting any time I would like to share pros and cons :Cons-1. Average battery life (6 hrs SOT)2. Average camera quality (improved with the latest update)3. Dust magnet. I have covered Op7 pro with in box cover and also tried ringke cover but dust is all over the phone. Pop up camera also covered in dust.4. Side curves aren't the best thing in this mobile.5. Fingerprint sensor is not so good and responded in 2 3 attempts.Pros -1. Fantastic performer.2. Awesome screen. Loved the 90hz thing. Very quick in response.3. Nightscape mode is awesome after update. Compared with s10+ and difference are unimaginable. Op7 pro's images are better and clearer than s10+. You can see the difference of HDR+ images.4. Oxygen os is far better than stock android.5. Stereo speakers are upto the mark. Compared with other dual speakers phone and sound is clear and easily heard in crowded places.6. Using type C bullet earphones with this and get awesome output from device.In the end it is the user liking or disliking about this specific device. Some people impressed with the image quality and some aren't. Some people liked the sound and some referred it as a noise. Build quality is upto the mark. Tried it with water splash and phone is working fine. Pop up camera is not the feature a user can buy this phone for.Although i am using this phone as daily driver and it is the best device in this price range if performance is taken for the benchmark.\n\n", "\n\n  Undoubtedly it's a product for the rationale consumers who always wants to maximize their utility against budget constraint.It may be that even the famous reviwers also somewhere divided in their opinion regarding considering one plus 7 pro as a true flagship killer or flagship itself.But,as I am not a rivewer but as a massive user of versatile phones regarding brands and variations,one thing I must say after using it no one can stop themselves to make it a permanent daily driver at least for now,that is until something powerful will come in terms of phone.It's a beast with beauty.A beautiful wait balanced, mesmerizing display, unique haptic feedback,tactile alert slider,clean and wonderfully positioned stereo speakers,fast and furious finger print sensor,superb connectivity,sweet and smooth performance, considerable battery life, fantastic ram management, decent camera wrapped with unique and silky operating system and support of one plus community...uffff ...like Shankar Mahadevan's breathless song.No one can deny its overall overwhelming performance.Though I miss 3.5 mm jack but it's ok,I can manage it.But,the customers, specially the one plus fan feel more joyous if atleast,one plus provide a headphone or atleast a connector within the box.I also use S10 plus ceramic black and iPhone X's but even after having those world's best two gadgets,I must say salute to speed and never settle!üòò\n\n", "\n\n  Just single drop of rain destroyed my ONEPLUS 7PRO.

I love playing PUBG and Asphalt 9 on Top setting and Result are terrific.2) Portrait Mode - OnePlus has never been the Best Camera device in market but OnePlus7pro has one top notch portrait mode. You will love taking Portrait in this device.3) Speed - With Latest 855 Snapdragon , I never laid hands on such smooth Android device . I can directly compare smoothness to IphoneX on this device.4) Built Quality - OnePlus 7 Pro has very strong built quality which I found very impressive. I did checked out YouTube videos to found its durability and was impressed.5) OxygenOS: With OxygenOS the experience of Android is smooth as silk.Cons :Water Proof : Only reason to not buy this mammoth phone . I was planning Huawei P30 Pro but then we have water proof cases for that purpose.Fingerprint Sensor : It does seems temperamental at times .Headphones : No Headphone Provided with devices and No Headphone Jack . Seriously heavy disappointment.Wireless Charging : Wireless Charging is a show off feature. We all know it's very slow but it does look good to flaunt.Weight : If you don't prefer Heavy phones , let this go . ONEPLUS 7pro is 200 gms and definitely feels heavy . Though I found  myself attracted to heavy phones .Review : If Best camera is priority  and you do tend to take underwater photography seriously, Spend 20K Extra for Huawei P30 Pro.OnePlus 7pro has a great camera , it's 3x zoom and bokeh is awesome . And is a great device , if you are looking for Good Camera , Super Cool Build and Best Performance.Speed is what OnePlus were really always selling here.

I witnessed a song app is playing music even after I killed all the process. As last step, I restarted the phone and to my surprise phone got stuck at restart for a minute or so without doing anything. After couple of minutes, I see screen going blank and photo just died. It won't start whatever you do. I finally found that this is a happening to many OP7 Pro phones and way to recover is pressing Power and Volume up key.Overall very disappointed . This has made me think if we should even trust and buy any more OP phone at all.I also found that once you purchase a phone through Amazon, it is not easy to return a defective phone. Even if you are still within 10 day return window, you cannot just ask for a replacement for defective phone. You have to spend good amount of time with Amazon customer service who will get a technician to visit you and find all ways not to accept the return which is very disappointing.So, firstly it is good to avoid this model till OP fixes this issue. If you still want to buy it, better buy it from retain stores and not online because you will be stuck with this product even if you don't want to.\n\n", '\n\n  This is my personal review after 2 days of usage and one thing is for sure , that this is the BEST DISPLAY ever, just like said at the event "FAST AND SMOOTH". Watching series/movies is a pleasing experience and hands on to One plus for that.The performance is smooth and amazingly fast as always with OP. They are Masters in this segment.I saw many comments on social media regarding the average battery backup, yes it is true but with WARP CHARGING it doesn\'t really matters. It is more than a balance to me. I won\'t mind burning more battery for a smoother experience which is new and missing with other brands.The biggest drawback I felt is the Camera. The pop up camera has got too much crop and if you open the video then you might end up shooting yourself only. The Rear camera too needs some optimisation which I am sure we will see soon.One thing which I want to bring in notice is the "NIGHTSCAPE" mode in Rear camera, it was working good before the first update and as soon I updated it , the quality went down. Same is with the normal one as well.One thing I felt which should have been given is the Type-C to 3.5mm jack cable, that was indeed missing. Rest everything is just perfect.Overall I will give it "4 stars out of 5". Deducted one because of the camera, was expecting a better one with OP7 pro atleast. I am optimistic that OP will come up with a strong solution soon. üññüññ\n\n', "\n\n  This is my first One Plus phone hence I don't  have a baseline to judge against.Pros:1. Excellent camera quality.2. It's a beauty to look at( P.S: I bought the Nebulae Blue).3. Display is just superb.(The resolution even when set to FHD+ and refresh rate of 60Hz is class leading).4. Snapdragon 855 is the fastest Qualcomm processor as of now so no knit picking in the speed and performance aspect.5. Price is perfect for all that you are getting.6. Selfie cam is better than I expected.Cons:1. The wide angle camera is a huge let down.(I have tried the S10+ wide angle lens setup and it's not comparable with this lens).2. No USB type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter.( Another huge let down if you are used to getting earphones out of the box.)3. The QHD+ and 90Hz refresh rate drains charge fast and it's pretty obvious.4. At least a splash proof body could have been given at this price ( This is because splash proof displays and IP rated Samsung phones start around the 10 - 20K price range).\n\n", "\n\n  Almost a week of use now and I'm loving it from every aspect. It's a flagship phone at a much lesser price than the other brands. Camera quality is superb and even night mode is great (only on the primary cam though, night mode doesn't work well in zoom/tele). It looks stunning, performance is superb and battery life is great even for a heavy user.\n\n", "\n\n  Better than Samsung M30,A30,A50,A70,mi note 7pro, poco f1, vivo v15, oppo f11 pro, one plus 6t and all other middle(under INR 30000).Also better than iPhone 7, 7plus, 8, 8 plus, xr and upper middle priced phone(up to INR 60000).Also ignore all other brand phones.Points:1. Camera is excellent, night mode is brilliant2. No lagging at all3. No heating issue4. Comes with warp charger in box, super fast charging5. Front screen is the curved and totally premium look. 6.67in Fluid Amoled Display (2340 x 1440 pixels, HDR10+).6. No bending issue. Solid body.7. Sceen is not bleeding. No problem at all.8. Android pie (v9) with one of the most lightest skin Oxygen OS 9.5.3GM21AA (lots of customizations possible)9. No network issue (mobile network, wifi, screen casting)10. Little bit Slippery back side due to glass body. You can buy back cover for that. Also Silicon cover is come within box, if you like it.11. Popup camera is automatically lowered during free fall. ie. If you are using your phone with front camera poped up, and accidentally you drop you phone, front camera will be automatically goes back inside.12. No bloatwares (only Google apps(can not uninstal), one plus' 3-4apps(some of them can be uninstall) and Netflix(can not uninstall) are pre-Installed.I bought one plus 1 back in 2014. After that no phone attract me to buy it. But finally made my mind to buy this phone. And so far, no regrets at all.Jumping 6 generation(from one plus 1 to one plus 7pro) is fun.Hope you also like this phone.\n\n", "\n\n  I bought this phone only for snapdragon 855 processor and all new 90hz display. I am satisfied with the display and the performance it provides. I don't use camera of any phone so my review will not tell about camera. But as I've seen with this phone camera quality is little bit average I'll say. This phone have some serious issues about the weight balance and absence of 3.5mm jack (adapter is not available also inbox ofcourse they want customers to spend valuable money on there brand). And non availability of 3.5mm adapter on official site is also a problem. Stereo speakers are also soo average.\n\n", "\n\n  PROS:1.) The first and most basic thing is OnePlus have always met the perfect requirement of a techie like me &2.) speaking about the price it's apt for what they have provided. People who are calling it pricey please use it for a week you'll find the difference. 3.)This one's a beast it can perform any kind of activity that the current smartphones can do.4.) Camera quality is awesome you can't expect a DSLR on a phone & don't compare it with all those apples or Galaxy s10s etc because your requirement is full filled UpTo the mark by a OnePlus 7 pro.5.) The oxygen OS is the most user friendly user ever.6.) Fingerprint sensor is in-display and it is best in class.7.) The front cam is a popup cam and it's not at all having any issues it's perfect it comes out and goes in lightning fast so no lags from the face detection.8.) Display is lit üî• af ! Even in 60Hz it goes like buttery smooth then 90Hz I'm leaving to your imagination.9.) Buttons & Gestures are the top notch features of OXYGEN OS and you'll find them very very useful in the OnePlus 7 pro.10.) The nebula blue color is damn awesome it's really pretty cool sexy superb. I named it BLUNEY üòúCONS :1.) The one and only backdrop is that no 3.5MM headphone Jack so all your old headphones or earphones are going to be wasted or there is a requirement of a connector from type C to 3.5MM.This connector is missing in the box.& The suggestion to OnePlus is they should've given the connector or an type C earphones in the box because we are paying 58000 and that's the least we can expect.Also a display clean cloth and a 2 or 3 extras need to be added in box.To the people who are saying they are showing a cloth , a car charger , a Bluetooth earphones , etc etc in the advertisements or YouTube review videos, it's a review video or advertisement where the people are given a whole different box which is made for a review it's not a sale unit please remember thats their advertisement and review strategy !Still if you can manage with a type C to 3.5mm connector or a  type C earphones then other than that this one's the best phone I've seen. There's no other issue with it as of 1 weeks usage.\n\n", "\n\n  Thankyou amazon for providing exchange offer for this. Display is the first thing you should talk about how smooth with the 90hz refresh rate and notch less display gives really great experience while watching movies, playing gamesetc.,Fingerprint reader is really superfast and the oxygen os makes you fall in love with it.Camera after many updates got better with natural colours and now it is good. Gaming is excellent. I didn't experienced any lag while playing heavy games like pubg, asphault etc., but the battery while playing games I got around five hours and in normal usage I got eight hours.\n\n", '\n\n  After a week use.Pros:Display is by far the best and awesome.Fast response, UI is very smooth - 90 htz.Camera is very good, not as good as Samsung and latest iPhones.Battery backup is decent.Cons:Phone is very slippery.No earphone jack, need to buy type-C earphone or adapter.I could not set different SMS ringtone for dual SIMs.No SD card slot.I felt battery is draining faster and warp charger is slower than Vivo Nex.Given transparent back cover is slippery. No additional matte cover as seen in unboxing on various YouTube videos.Will post more as I find more.____________________Further experience:Touch is not consistently responsive, especially through screen guard.I had to buy type-C earphone and adapter for 3.5mm earphone, recording is not good through adapter.48mp camera clarity can only be achieved in Pro mode, other modes are surprisingly of average or low standard compared to Samsung phones.Noticed that GPS loses direction which is quite annoying and not sure others faced. I could compare with other phone on the same route.Fingerprint response is incredible, top in Android phones.WARP charging is faster than I noticed initially.\n\n', "\n\n  The most expensive OnePlus phone yet and they definitely have done a great job. The moment you look at the 90FPS AMOLED you are above to fall in love and also will be main selling reason of the phone. It definitely beats iPhone xs in terms of performance and the smoother animations certainly helps. Gaming on this amazing display is a delite and all the games works really buttery smooth. OnePlus has also improved the haptic feedback on this device tho it can not match the level of iPhone but a good change is always welcome. The phone has its downside however, first the camera. I don't see any major improvement in the camera after coming from OP 6 I still feel its kinda the same although OP has this time around went with completely different sensor. Photos from the main sensor are great with great detailing tho falls in low light situation. The telephoto lens doesn't perform that great and found images to be washed out in most scenarios tho a software update can hopefully fix this. Finger print scanner is quick but it sometimes won't recognize the finger no matter what. Battery life isn't that great but with moderate use it can go for entire day of usage. Speakers are a much upgrade from last OP devices which is now stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos on board. Speakers however do offer decent feedback and can get really loud if thats what you want.Pros:Boy oh boy that display!Performance is top notch and is certainly the best performance phone in the market today.Price; considering how expensive phones have got lately I will say OP7 pro packs a lot and will certainly make users happy.Oxygen OS - I would prefer Oxygen OS over stock Android as it offers much more than what stock has to offer without losing the minimalist charm. Oxygen OS always have provided on top time software updates which is a pro in itself.ConsCamera's could have been better.Fingerprint scanner doesn't work properly sometimes.Speakers could have been better.OP should at least provide earphones in the box considering the price they are charging.\n\n", '\n\n  Awesome phone with great display. Camera quality is better then previous OnePlus phones, however its still not upto the mark of Samsung s10 or P20 pro. Also be aware that there is a price difference of almost 20k between S10+, P30 pro and oneplus7 Pro, so comparing their camera might not do justice. However it does fair pretty well, night mode is very good. Even though this is the most expensive model till date from OnePlus, its still has all the next gen features such as HDR10+, UFS 3 and so on which makes the price really apt. I love the curved display, unlike Samsung where you can visibly see the edges curved, in OnePlus the front display is curved in a grace full manner which later blends into the back panel.\n\n', "\n\n  I would like to say that this is not an 'out of world' product as you see in most of the reviews. The one and most amazing aspect I like about this product is its display for which I would give 4.5/5 compared to iPhone XS Max display which would be 4/5 according to my experience.  In performance factor also I would say that this will be the fastest phone I have ever used. Apart from these 2, this phone is just like any other Android phone in this price range or slightly above. The camera is just an average component and cannot be called as a flagship feature here (except night shots are pretty amazing though). The size is also quite huge that its difficult to operate it with just one hand. Charging is pretty decent and would take around .1 - 1.15 hours from 0-100. Battery back is the same as that of one plus 6t which will last for a day with a full charge and medium usage. Overall I would say this is an okayish product but not an amazing product from the future.\n\n", "\n\n  The battery back up on the so called 4000 mAh is only 7 hours. This 7 hours is with just 20 minutes screen usage.Raised a replacement request with Amazon. The technician who was supposed to visit on the scheduled day called up and mentioned that battery issue can come up because of apps and also the screen resolution. I have been using one plus 5t and it lasted 20-25 hours with the same usage and same applications. I had to put all my applications in optimise in the 7 pro to keep the battery last till evening. My friends using one plus 7 (not the pro) did not face any issue and their batteries lasted for over 20 hours.The worst part on Amazon's side is that the technician did not turn up and I got an email saying I was not reachable. When I contacted the technician he mentioned that he was busy with other customers and so he turned down my req. Now Amazon calls me back the next day from some unknown number and asks me for my details to place this technician request.Why playing cheap tactics to avoid replacement amazon by extending the dates ?\n\n", "\n\n  Its a nice phone to buy ....one plus always works on speed and delivering it in right pricePros*Amazing Display ( with modes to adjust to save battery life )*UFS 3.0 tested and it's actually fast.*Good battery life*Good Sound Quality compared to all other one plus device*Sufficient storage and we'll optimized ram management* Best Nightscape mode ( Camera only this feature )Come* Feels heavy while operating* Camera is okay and needs a lot of upgrade where OnePlus will eventually fix it post testing* No accessories like headphone or ctype to 3.5 convertor* Wireless charging* IP water resistant rating ( but it's splash proff and needs to be dried of soon )Processor is Superb üëçCamera is okay but fair enough .. love the nightscape mode üåôBuild is Nice üòéDisplay is flawless not comments for the sameü§òSound / Speaker output is just good enough... üëåYes the mobile is dam heavy and not for one hand use ...u need dinosaur palm to handle it üòÇFinger print reader will eventually get better as the AI will keep on recognizing the new side finger input.‚òùÔ∏è\n\n", "\n\n  OnePlus 7 pro just feels so premium it just beautiful.

Just one issue with fingerprint sensor in display and I found that on screen sensor is not as sensitive as sensors on back.\n\n", "\n\n  Review after 6months:Not preferable,1. when try to put face unlock that will the most weird thing you'll see, coz the cam should pop out and detect you and which will take time to complete this process.2. Major drawback is NFC(tap & pay) is disabled/not working, why would you put more money when this are not working?3. Lots and lots of bugs like when you swipe for menu most of the times you will observe the apps invisible.4. Phone gets heated alot and lot when you play pubg/games.5. As per the company this phone should hardly get warmer when you use for a long time, but the AMOLED this is pure nonsense.6. You'd feel it very slippery without having a cover.7. Battery backup is not that great, it will make you to charge twice in a day.8. Accessories are touching sky with their price.\n\n", "\n\n  I have bought this phone 10 days back. While the phone was in my pocket with some keys the back panel got cracked .Poor plastic quality is being used. And for the repairs if you will go to their so called EXCLUSIVE service centres you'll hardly find air to breathe. They just have 1 repair engineer who looks after all the devices .If you are spending half a lac rupees on such a gadget then it just feel as if I have thrown my money in the garbage.They dont have adequate staff to manage their repairs even.Finally i have spent another 4k on getting the new back panel which they are again claiming can break any time.GREAT SERVICE HATSS OFF!!!DONT BUY!\n\n", "\n\n  Just an amazing phone... I upgraded from Redmi Y2 and trust me guys...if you are upgrading from some 10-15k phone to this one... you'll surely love this device.

Some people were complaining about Ghost Touch or Pop up camera coming out while calling, we'll I haven't seen anything like that till now. These issues are present only on a very small no. of devices, so most probably you won't get a defective one...Warp charging is brilliant. Overall I think you should go for it.

I ordered it even after knowing of all the issues people are facing on it, I was little afraid but thank God I am not facing any such issues, no ghost touch, no battery drain etc. Camera might not be good for people who regularly use high end devices, but it's not bad. The overall experience is just amazing be it sound from speakers, the beautiful display and the smoothness of OS' transition animations, and ofcourse the new haptic feedback motor is amazing, it makes the overall experience even better.

As they mentioned seriously it's the really the best phone. Best features. I took 8gb ram 7 pro.1. Display, 2. Touch, 3. Camera, 4. Speed, 5. Design, 6. Battery life, 7. Fast charge.Drawbacks1. No headset jack.2. Portrait mode is only for limited distance.3. Memory card slot.As it is the premium phone and paying 53k we expect basic things like headset jack or the headset. But didn't even give the music jack connector.All the premium phones have wireless features but we miss in this phone. Hope it comes in next version.\n\n", '\n\n  I bought a oneplus 7pro and i was happy but oneplus doesnt provide type c to 3.5 mm jack.. i have managed by not having audio jack in phone but why didnt u give the connector in the box content.. I was vry disappointed with oneplus... I have paid 49k for a phone and i didnt get a type c to 3.5 mm jack connector!! This is vry disappointing..\n\n', "\n\n  Everything is great about the phone except for a few things.1. Due to curved edged screen, touching at undesired points becomes eminent, which leads to opening apps randomly which I don't want to.2. Adobe Acrobat Reader Pro gets stuck if the file size is beyond 2 MB, even with 8 MB RAM!3. Screen guard which comes with the phone by default, is of quite poor quality. Mine got worn and torn within first 3 weeks.But apart from the above, the phone's performance, battery, camera, sound, speed - everything is just great! Despite the minor flaws, I am loving this one!\n\n", "\n\n  Ok first let me tell you something. All the negative reviews are before the OTA update. So if you are wondering whether to buy it or not, don't think again. This mobile is a beast.Pro'sTop class displayNo notchesVery Good battery. Getting 7.5 hrs SOT with 90hz+ QHDStereo Speakerssplash resistantOxygen OS (I am sure it will go till Android 12)Super fast indisplay Finger print scannerCon'sNo headphone jack. Not even converter provided. I thought there will be one.Pretty Okish Camera. Hoping for some good OTA updates.No LED notification lightFinally Camera to Api is enabled. So install Gcam and it will do wonders.\n\n", "\n\n  If there's one thing that caught my eye when my colleague bought this phone is the display. It was a stunning 2k+ Quad HD display after all. It then lead me to look for video reviews from the youtube experts. It turns out, they did appreciate the display and phone. It's amongst the best displays on a phone in recent times and it's a Samsung panel.Pros of this phone:1. Ultra smooth beautiful quad hd screen with a 90 Hertz display. It is 6.67 inches in size including the curved edges. It's great for social media,videos which can render in 1440p if available and for reading too. It also does not have a notch and you pretty much love it.2. Battery life with a 4000 MAH battery is great when you consider that you use a 90 Hz refresh vivid qhd screen. Your could switch to 60 Hz but nah. :)3. Back cameras do a good job in capturing pics. An yet to really test them. The front 16 mp pop up camera works well. It's a good camera setup.4. It's got the SD 855 processor and it's butter smooth and fast.5. With the oxygen OS, it delivers near stock Android experience. It will very soon be upgraded to 10.6. Warp charging: it's got crazy fast charging compared to op6 which I have before this and 90% will get your through the day and more.7. The on screen finger print sensor is great to use.Cons:1. It's a heavy phone at 200 grams. You will take a week to get used to it since we all are so adaptive.2. It's got a curved display with curved edges. Accidental Ghost touches do occur from time to time. Also, your need to be careful. If you drop it face down, it will fall on the screen side given its weight and with the curved edges, there is a chance to break.3. With the launch of the OP7t, One plus has diluted the significance of this phone. We Indians are price conscious and the OP 7t costs 7k lower than each of the OP 7 pro models even after prices dropped on the 7 plus pro (OP 7 pro costs 4k lesser than when launched 6 months ago).Update: just found that there's a One Plus 7t Pro launching on October 10th 2019. With it, this will be definitely be the undisputed OP Flagship.4. For the price, no type C to 3.5 mm jack connector in the box, no type C ear phones, no wireless charge, no waterproof certification but you do get a case.Verdict:If you want the great screen, FHD+ 2K+ display, 90 Hz refresh and notch less design, go for the one plus pro. If you want most of what pro has, a balanced phone, some additional features and are ok with the 2k display and notch screen design, go for One plus 7t which is a super budget flagship killer too.\n\n", '\n\n  Very bad service of amazon there is no content service .There is a option to call but no one call me .Sepaker hv problem sometimes .

Over all it's a good phone for one year use .. rest is best ..\n\n", "\n\n  I was skeptical on whether to buy it or not but ended up buying it.

You will not be disappointed\n\n", "\n\n  Phone is simply Superb. Camera, screen, speed, quality and look and feel.Only area of improvement is battery. But yeah, with this performance you won't be disappointed with buying a power bank for this phone.And Warp charging is soooooper fast.\n\n", '\n\n  i face many problems and getting frustrated because of  many issue likealthough big ram but still it hangs . touch pad working automatically even after screen lock...the screen lock is not working and you can unlock with only one up swap...and automatically dailed numbers....\n\n', "\n\n  Starting with the camera quality, the phone takes gorgeous pictures. Within three weeks, OnePlus has send more than three updates centered on the camera and it gets better and better. Photos are sharp, colors a bit vibrant but I love it, video quality is better than any phone. Portraits are somewhat average, but that is true for any smartphone. Selfies too are of very good quality, and support nightscape.In very low light (almost pitch black with a few lights in the distance) the phone performed better than my expectations but I rarely use it for such situations. In normal low light (clubs, dimly lit rooms) it performs very well. I have attached a lot of camera samples. The best part about the OnePlus 7 Pro is the sharp quad HD display and with the 90Hz display, you can't stop just scrolling through your phone because it's so smooth and addictive. Everything from 4k videos to just the wallpapers look mesmerizing on this phone. The chin of the phone is also almost non existent, like the iPhone X.The fingerprint reader is very fast but takes more than one try with wet hands.The battery lasted much longer than the reviews said, easily finishing one day (and more than one with moderate usage and the battery saver turned on).The performance is just mind-numbingly fast. I realised its importance while opening PayTm which would always open slowly on my previous phone. No lag whatsoever.OxygenOS is a big reason to consider this phone because it is much better than the OneUI or Oppo/Vivo's wierd UIs.The only complaint I have is that OnePlus did not include a headphone jack converter in the box and the official converter on their website is out of stock. I tried a few cheap converters but sound quality was very bad. This is a trick for me to buy their new Bluetooth earphones WHICH I WILL NOT.Anyway the speaker quality is very very rich and good with Dolby Atmos so I can manage till I buy a pair of other Bluetooth earphones.\n\n", '\n\n  I would like to thanks One plus for launching this amazing mobile..camera is awesome , beyond expectation.. especially the night mode.. battery back is good..touch screen is like butter...overall I will suggest this is best smart phone I have ever seen around me..I am sharing this after using around 15 days...\n\n', '\n\n  Dislay-Great 90hz QHD+ AMOLED display5/5Camera- It is good but struggles in tricky situation especially in low light but still its 4/5 on camera department.UI - 1000000/5Sound- Loud and clear but bass is little off 4.5/5Battery- It hogs a lot of battery. You need to carry that WARP Charger around if you want to last a day if you watch a lot of YouTube/Netflix or play games. Otherwise for a typical user it would last a day 3/5.Charging Speed - 10/5\n\n', "\n\n  3 things :-1 Camera - Camera is like 15000 phone Ka Ho, Camera is not What i expected after spending so much..2 - Fingerprint - Sometime it irritates!!  im like Bhai Bhool Gya kya mujhe..3 - Not Feature rich like Samsung s10plusNow If you like Speed then Go for it, But Camera is where 1+ has to do Something & i m shocked that this phone doesn't have 960fps slowmo!!!  Thats why im saying 30000 is okay for this phone.. & Guys It is Heavy Brick so be prepared.. Charging is Really fast, Screen is Awesome, 855 Dragon is Does the job.. But still i wont suggest this phone unless u get it below 30000..Thank you\n\n", "\n\n  I got my first OnePlus 7 pro after a week it's launched but the Pop up camera not working properly... so I requested Amazon and theyvsent someone for inspection. After that when this defect is confirmed, I got my mobile on 2 nd day.. Thanks Amazon for responding so fast.After one successful replacement I finally got my phone. One plus 7 pro is one of it's kind. No comparison..... Video quality and stability mind blowing.... Camera quality decent... Touchscreen works like charm.... U will understand after using it.... Screen - OMG! really appreciate this approach.After having blazing fast processor and amazing fluid amoled screen i am pretty impressed that it stays long enogh ... Almost 18 to 20 hours... I playbpubg, watching videos on YouTube and Amazon prime.... Though its give very decent battery life....After 1 month of full usage I can say proudly that I am satisfied with this product. A bit disappointed on OnePlus for not adding the type C to 3.5 mm jack. But overall its a mobile worth of 50k....\n\n", '\n\n  One major drawback is that you cannot make folders inside the apps screen. Whats the point in spending 60k when you cannot even organise your work. Everytime you go to apps screen , just try finding the app you are looking for. Also amazon just replaces and doesnt allows us to return the phone. Never buy in my recommendation.......go for samsung note 10 instead......\n\n', '\n\n  Have never used an Android phone before with this much speed.A bit of device getting heated while charging otherwise all device and features is good.And what a screen this has. üòä\n\n', "\n\n  Just changed over to OP7 pro from hauwei mate 20 pro.

Is hit and miss. Sometimes images are stunning. Other wise very cartoony5. Battery is average. Nothing to worry. But nothing to rejoice. Recharging is super fast6. Because of curved display lot of unintentional palm touches.7. Gaming is excellent8.speakers are stunning9. no headphone jack. And it's not gonna come back into any top tier phones. So not an issue.Over all Good. Not as satisfied as my Mate 20 proBcos.1. Mate 20 pro was super to hold it. Slightly smaller almost perfect2. No IR blaster in OP7 pro3. Nightmode is so artificial4. Faceunlock is scary bcs everytime the camera come out it's a small worry somewhere in my mind Even though I know it's good to last5. No IP ratingoxygen OS is very good. But I don't think that's the one reason you should buy it. My friend has k20 pro with Nova launcher and it's almost as fast as my OP7pro.Bottom line .. buy it for display. Buy size s a worry.Buy it for oxygen.. but you can get this performance even with 31k k20 pro with launcher.Buy it for multimedia and gamesNot for camera.You will be satisfied with OP7 pro. No doubt!!!\n\n", "\n\n  A true flagship phone at a very good price. Camera is too good and the screen is just amazing. The onscreen fingerprint sensor is very fast and so I'd the facial recognition. Very smooth performance and no lag. Good gaming experience. Full charge takes no more than 75 mins. However, battery backup is not up to the mark. Worth for the money.\n\n", "\n\n  Loved it. But it has its own pros n cons. Best screen ever, with Dolby stereo speaker really awesome performance while playing games like pub g and call of duty. I have been using since two weeks now never felt a lag. But price is too high. It doesn't have notification light, no 3.5mm headphone jack,  battery drains fast. but it last for 1day.

We anyways get 84 days 1.5 GB for 399 with Rs 50 discount.3) I've restarted the phone once because it hanged.4) I'm eligible for the 6 months free screen damage protection but am not able to understand how to activate it.The phone is ok but I'm a Oneplus fanboy and expected complete flawlessness.

Some people complaint some things in review section but if you want to get good quality product then ignore those negative reviews and go for it.\n\n', "\n\n  The Oneplus 7 Pro is a stunner. Gorgeous design. At the rear it had a 3 camera setup. All three work amazingly. The 3x telephoto actually helps and gives very clear pictures. The nightscape mode is the best I've seen till now. The results are stunning to say the least. Check the attached pictures. None of these have been reprocessed. The screen is smoother beauty. Full saturated colours and perfect. I'm not sure I'm fond of the curved screen though. The call quality and reception is perfect. The BT range of excellent. The 2 external speakers are unexpectedly, actually very good. The battery life is more than adequate. In my normal use its still at 70% in the evening. Like all the preceding Oneplus models this too is blazingly fast.If I have a grouse outs the automatic screen brightness. It's absolutely useless. It does nothing. My Oneplus 5t controlled brightness really well. Is this a deal breaker? Not one bit. This is the best mobile for me and the one that gives real bang for the buck\n\n", '\n\n  Been using the phone for 4 days now.. few glaring ommissions1. No otg connector cable.2. No 3.5 mm audio jack connector.At least this was expected to be part of the retail box for such a premium phone.Apart from these the phone is just awesome and definitely packs a punch\n\n', "\n\n  This purchase hands you a premium phone with top-notch specifations at a distinctly cheaper price.  The performance is powerful with a full-day battery. The screen is extremely beautiful making it ideal to watch videos and play games. The software OxygenOS is secure, smooth, and user friendly. It feels delicate in the hand and you would require the use of covers for which there are limited quality options. The pop-up camera can be annoying sometimes and front camera picture quality is average, thus it's not ideal for selfie lovers and video makers. The back camera is almost at par with all the top notch phones currently on the market. Overall, the phone provides a premium experience.\n\n", "\n\n  The phone was delived in best possible conditon. Thanks Amazon and the vendor for not disappoing me.Looks wise, phone is amazing!!The first problem is the weight. It weighs around 208 g, heavier than a normal phone but now i am used to it...The screen is curved and looks fantabulous..such a huge screen with amazing display catches plenty of eye-balls every single day.No notch ( best possible feature of this phone)Since I have used Samsung Galaxy S7 edge for past 4 years therefore this phone is a piece of cake for me...no accidental touches and nothing.The 90 Hz display makes it smooth like butter..I phone users also complimented me that your phone works like an I phone (extremely happy).The transparent cover make the phone look weird so I switched to a glass cover that made my phone look super good...I recommend to ditch that transparent cover and keep it for emergency.Remember cover is extremely important for curved screen. Without cover you may end up breaking you screen. If it fall flat on floor nothing would happen but if it fall from any of the edge...( Even God won't be able to save it)..make sure to cover all four edge and you are good to go!!As far as charger is concern, I am super happy with it..It charges the phone in an hour from zero to 100%. However, if charges from zero to 50% in 20 min and subsequently its speed drops from going 50 to 100%. Weird ...but true!A single charge can last throughout the day on weekdays and if you use it thoroughly (like on weekends) then 5 hours I suppose.Battery isn't a great deal here but it is compromisable because to it's charging speed.Specs wise...i don't find anything new while switch from Samsung flagship to this..but definely getting all the features of a Samsung flagship at such a low price is praiseworthy.Pop up camera is something I love the most!!Back cameras are also nice, but you need to learn, how and when to use it. Once you understand it well you can get most out of it..Adaptability is important factor here..Moreover photography requires lot of mental abilities and skills...it's is always tiring for me...so I always need a phone that can click best pic in auto mode...but this phone disappoints me here.Anyways..the front camera is little weird and I don't like selfies here...but still optimisable!For a normal used these problem won't make much a difference.If you know a little bit of photography then it's camera setup can compete with flagship phones of Samsung and i-phone. But if you are a normal user than you might not able to click mind- blowing picture with it...The face recognition works even faster than fingerprint scanner...loved it...so convient but cost potential security threats...Fingerprint scanner also works super fast if it recognise your finger well...But not the case with me...I need to touch twice or thrice...I think I need to re-register my thumb and figure in a same way I use it in phone to avoid such problem...Overall....at Rs 43 k I strongly recommend it...and you won't regret it after buying this phone..!!Explore you tube videos (tips and tricks) to discover all hidden feature of this phone and to extract most out of it...\n\n", '\n\n  This phone is an absolute gem barring a few minor issues.Pros:Super fast (including charging)Great selfie camera buildSmoothBrilliant displayBattery lifeCons:No headphone jack (buy a USB type C to headphone jack converter)No external drive slotFingerprint sensor is not as fast as the rest of the featuresI will try to give a detailed review after using it for a month or so. Thank you for your time.\n\n', "\n\n  OnePlus 7 Pro - A Better Phone (As they say)OnePlus has revamped its phone completely. Whether its Screen, Processor, Camera, or even vibration motor.Here is my review for the phone.The Nebula Blue color looks amazing but it will be available from 28th May. So i got the Mirror Grey. Initial impressions are highly impressive. You don't get a phone in the boz. You get a massive screen. A huge 6.7' screen with no notch, no cutout, Just full screen. Viewing media on this beautiful gadget without any restriction is a great feeling.Pros:Quad HD+ Curved Display. Its massive, Its Quad HD, It have 90hz refresh rate, And yeah its beautiful Amoled.Dual Stereo Speaker with Dolby Atmos. Super loud sound clarity.Snapdragon 855. Faster than your blink.Camera. By far the best camera setup of OnePlus. I won't say its better than x y or z bt yeah its a flagship level quality. U can click awesome pictures with good details. Video stabilization is simply amazing as always OnePlusUFS 3.0 - Guys it is a mad thing. It makes the phone superfast. Transferring files like snap.Battery. Its 4000mAh guys. You can easily get 5-6 SOTCons :Its huge. One hand use not possible.Its heavy.No type-c to 3.5mm dongleThat's all.\n\n", '\n\n  Best budget smartphone in $700 price range. It is true to its class " the flagship killer". Only drawback i could find was that it is too large for single hand use  and battery consumption on daily usage although that can be justified by the presence of a 90hz display. Other than that a solid smartphone , feels premium in the hand with glass back and state of the art pop up selfie camera. I guess oneplus is living up to it\'s name and their motto "Never Settle".\n\n', '\n\n  very good mobile , must buy who have 50k budget for a phone, no problems faced on this phone. cons no 35 mm jack , camera software need a real upgrade. caution : buy solid back and front cases along because my mobile back broke from one feet fall in a week.\n\n', "\n\n  It's a good phone I simply loved it the performance is awesome it's fast and smooth SD 855 rocks, the looks of the phone is great.

I hope this will be informative for you.Pros1) It looks very stylish and slightly curved display is added beauty of this mobile.2) Display/Screen is large and give ultimate movie/video Experience3) I did use the 1+ 6 earlier as well so comparison to that it\'s far better than if i compare the sound quality. it Gives 3D sound effects4) Vibration intensity is quite good5) Charging speed is good, But to get the 100% charge it takes long time6) Rear Camera is very good, But Video/Image stabilization is less than one plus 6, and slow motion video requires high lights, capturing motion object is not good. but wide image capturing and day light shots still will not disappoint you.7) Front camera here is pop up camera so according to me for the selfie you do not need to clean Everytime... so i like it personally8) Storage is enough to handle your data9) Data transfer rate via cable or Wireles is fast, But also produce heat10) Finger Print is OK, I will not say bad but its not lightening fast11) overall it\'s good product will not disappoint you when you will go for thisCons Hardware is strong but there are some software problem which i face i will mention here... its not a show stopper but One Plus need to look into this.1) If you remember one plus 6 that gives alphabet reflection  "S" on its glass panels and it was added style... but One plus 7 they didn\'t provided that kind of reflection.... i am not happy with that2) No accessories like earphones with the box3) I purchased type C bullets earphone from one plus but it is not smooth to insert and move out from type C port4) Pre applied screen protector there is bubble in curved corner.. So i think  it will not work for me for long time :(5) Now come to the software isssue- Screen Auto Brightness is not well tuned- Rotation sensors is not work well some time you need to slap the mobile to work the same :(- Rotation sensors not works for all mode of example if you are looking some file from the file manager  and you want to horizontal look into that so that will not work- Supposed you have opened the WhatsApp and suddenly call come then you will not able to who is calling and what number its you need to click on that-When call is active in SIM 1 you will not receive mesg on SIM 2 , I faced this issue many time i used to disconnect the call to get that message- When i put my mobile in pocket and when i move out from my pocket it says to many wrong or incorrect Finger attempt kind of message.. so I guess may be pocket sensors is not there or i have not enabled some settings on it- There are many other software issue i observed which i faced i dont want to make this post lengthy by this so moving next-Screen recoder should work in background, but here it gives dot symbol, So what if i want to record activity on my mobile in hidden way ? there is no option6) Cover is good fited but to charge the mobile you need to move out  the plastic cover from type C port but after using 20 days shape has changed of that and its not covering any more type C port, then why they haven\'t cut that piece which is almost unused. its very annoying to see that pieceNote : These above software issue points should not stop you to buy this product... These are minor problem that can be rectified by newer updateand i want to appriciate and wish good luck to One Plus and it\'s team for this product. Such a nice product.\n\n', "\n\n  Display - 10/10Sound quality - 10/10Battery - 10/10Fast charging - 10/10 ( But it heats up sometime during charging but not always , so might be running background apps issue )Performance - 9/10Day Camera - 8/10 ( not including GCam )Low light Camera - 9/10Camera in pro mode (9/10)Fingerprint - 8/10 ( once or twice a week it actually lits up but doesn't work )Call voice quality - 9/10Touch and scrolling - 9.5/10 ( Edge could have been used better so it's 9.5)Liked features -Performance is awesome and on screen fingerprint is so fast .You can actually clicks awesome images using pro mode if you are photography freak.Bugs are continuously being taken care with software updates.(3 times till now).Everytime charged .

I have 8Gb and 256 Gb variants. Despite being the higher end of it's offering, it doesn't perform up to its standard. It hangs very often even while single-tasking. It's a shame on One Plus that even their camera doesn't respond while clicking the pictures. Their customer support is neither responsive not agile. They still are very parochial in their approach and it's better to go for some brand that listens to their customers.\n\n", "\n\n  I was using 1plus 3T from last 2.5 years and I was satisfied with it. I was happy that I am upgrading my phone with 1plus 7pro which I have heard about a lot but my expectations were shattered when I used its camera. The camera quality is very poor as compared to what has been shown in the launch event. I am very disappointed with it as my main purpose to buy this phone is because of its camera.

This is the worst phone I have ever bought. Even though there are few good things such as display, camera but bat things out number good things. I have been facing many problems after 3 weeks of the purchase of phone.Problems I have been facing:1. My phone gets switched off when I recieve a call.  I have never heard this problem and never faced this  problem before. Also worst thing is I won't know who  called me after I switch on my phone.2. Battery life:  When I recieved this phone, I was very happy with the  battery life. But after 6 weeks of usage, I have been  facing issues wirh the battery. For 2 hours usage of  Netflix, the battery consumption increased to 25-28  percent from 18-20 percent.3. Lagging:  I always keep my system up to date with system  updates. But sometimes my phone lags as if it has been  used for 2 years.4. OnePlus customer service:  I have contacted OnePlus customer service several  times, but none were able to solve my issues.At first I was very happy while I was using my phone, but now all I do is worry when I use my phone.I hope OnePlus will solve my phone problems. I would be very happy if OnePlus acknowledges my message.\n\n", '\n\n  Full 5 ‚ú≥Ô∏è.. also my 1st Oneplus...Touch sensibility 5/5Gaming 5/5Camera 4.5/5 (cartoon type pictures)Vibrator engine 5/5Screen ratio 5/5Battery backup 4/5 .

I first ordered this and fingerprint reader came with defect after which I followed with amazon badly but got poor response. The phone was replaced in close to 7 days of time, the second phone also came with defect and it is heating up even over 45 degree while in normal usage and now it is a pain. Moreover amazon have very bad support on this. Polishing used on phone is also bad, after 10 days of normal usage scatches have appeared on phone not on glass back but on metal side of phone.\n\n', "\n\n  The screen size and viewing has just spoiled me.The bezeless screen with curved display is really to die for. I don't know if I can ever go back from this screen to any other device now.The processing speed is really really good.It doesn't slow down when it is dying in battery or if 4-5 apps are running in parallel. Processing is just flawless.When I was buying this phone, I was continuously told that camera is something u won't like. However, to my surprise till now the images taken are just amazing.Really love the portrait mode and wide angle feature on this. So amazing.Overall mobile feels really premium in your hands.Must recommended buy if this comes under your budget.\n\n", '\n\n  I bought it for my friendCamera AwesomePerformance MindblowingLook ShinyPrice Not ok with thatFingerprint Very responsiveBattery life upto 8hrsBest in class camera\n\n', "\n\n  I have been using this phone for almost 7months now, I upgraded from Nexus 6P and this is my first oneplus phone.The screen is excellent and it is the biggest USP of this phone. It is a breeze to use this phone, UI is uncluttered and minimalist.However, the worst part of this phone is FINGERPRINT SCANNER which ruins the entire experience of using the phone. They snapped on a half baked technology called optical fingerprint scanner, more than 50% time it doesn't work. I tried multiple times deleting and enrolling again, it did not improve. It is not that it doesn't work but it is unpredictable when it won't work. Imagine you try to unlock the phone using finger and it doesn't work on repeated attempts and you have to finally enter the PIN to unlock the phone. Imagine having this repeat 15-20 times a day !! All this with a clean thumb, if you got wee bit of dust or dirt on your finger, just forget it !!. For example, after you open your car door and get in, I can guarantee that the phone unlock wont work, a little bit of dust on the door handle is enough to kill this. I am truly frustrated with this, my nexus 6P had physical scanner on the back and it never failed; instant unlock every single time, may be it didn't work once in a million attempts.To circumvent this problem, I can't use face unlock either! because this has got a pop up camera that needs to pop up do a face unlock, the phone throws a warning if you retract the pop up camera a few times. I originally intended to keep the phone for 3 years but now I am so frustrated that I am looking to move to a Samsung or something better.\n\n", "\n\n  So been using it for a week and a half or so ,here's the layman review the kind I would've wanted to read here in the review sectionPro's-SCREEN- so good you'll find it hard to keep the phone away from you for even a little while .It's butter like crazy smooth.DISPLAY- be it qhd or fhd things are way above par a premium experience warm and subtle bright colors soothe your eyes enhanced by the resolution options offered by the phone . It's 'For your eyes only '.CHARGE- it's 'warping' fast I charge my phone at 5% mark and 30 minutes later it is 65 % so the One plus did good on the promise . The brick is beast of a charging plug.REFRESH RATE - ITS 90 Hz or nothing that's how fantastic that refresh is . 60Hz doesn't disappoint either  , the difference between the two is not too much but you definitely feel surfing a wave while sliding down and up it'll be a whole new time pass .lolCAMERA- nightscape mode and normal photo mode are super cool crisp and subtle pics to impress anyone . The pop up selfie camera gives a clean and cool selfie . So pop it like you work itOthers- no heating issues did play pubg on 90 Hz and qhd lasted me 3.5 hrs on what was the best pubg experience thus far . The only reason i reinstalled pubg after quitting it last year was to check the limits of the specs offered by the phone and it superceded it in everyway possibleCONS-BATTERY- 90 Hz and qhd will take a toll on your phone .battery life is disappointing kind of but given high end specs you get at this price plus the warp charge I think the company made its warp charging knowing that .With high end spec it lasts about 4-5 hrs extensive use like gamingWith 90hz and fhd about 5-6 he extensive to moderate use .60 hz and fhd -5-7.5 hrs with extensive to moderate useHANDLING-depends on your hands me being a 6'3 didn't find it difficult at all.CAMERA- even after the update the portrait mode is disappointing depth effect has played a spoil sport .NO DONGLE(SCREW YOU ONE PLIS FOR THAT ;). )NO HEADPHONE JACK (DOUBLE SCREW YOU)Overall go for it just the best experience this flagship has to offer in range of 49k to 53 k .NOTE - DO NOT REMOVE THE GLASS ON THE SCREEN THAT IS THERE BY DEFAULT IT IS THE BEST ONE YOU'VE GOT FOR A LONG WHILE WILL DO JUSTICE\n\n", '\n\n  Do not peel off original screen protector that comes with phone.. reason is currently no screen guards are available and most of glass screen protectors dont work..Rest of the things as you already know.One less star because I received the piece with one noticeable scratch on the screen.Over all worth buying for sure.\n\n', '\n\n  Where do i start! Ok one week down the lane, this phone to begin with looks spectacular, atleast from the screen and display point of view i dont know what could better this now. Next up, The 90hz refresh rate makes your phone feel buttery and you will love it(comes at a negotiable cost of reduced battery life) . It\'s alright though since it\'s powered with a WARP charger that works like a charm. Talking about cameras now, pop-up camera adds to the elligence of this phone. The picture qulities are stunning at times. I have tried macro photo graphy with this one and the details it can catch are just terrific to believe. 4k recording is excellent, stability is alright!! At this price (42k) it\'s almost unreal as to what this phone has to offer. Nebula blue color makes this gadget look like out of this planet. Let\'s not even get into specification. Because it\'s all just "beyond the speed". One amazing product!!\n\n', "\n\n  This is my first OnePlus DeviceAnd I can say this is the best phone I have ever used .The 90hz display is amazingI can guarantee once you started using the phone on 90hz you can't go back to lower refresh rate.. you will feel and can see the other phones lagging..Camera is not up to the mark but the latest update improve a lot .. and can be better in next updates..Battery life is good ... Not the best due to higher refresh rate and quad hd resolution.. but if you want good battery life you can do so by changing the screen resolution to full HD+ and the refresh rate to 60hz..The fingerprint is super fast..And the WARP Charge , this is amazing..The phone charges very quickly..Oxygen Os is awsm.. (best os ever)Weight - the phone is a lit bit heavy.. but if you use the case you wont feel it heavy..\n\n", '\n\n  Speakers are good. Screen is good.But performance is getting worse.. Multitasking is impossible, if i open a notification and go back to previous opened app it starts all over again. Mi phones have better multi tasking than this i felt.If i get a phone call, and go back to opened app same happens.\n\n', '\n\n  Pro & Cons for One Plus 7Pro:-Pros:1. I am a great fan of One Plus and i have been using one plus5 from last 2 year so there is no question of phone getting lagging issue or anything like that, but when i received my One Plus 7Pro lagging word is simply unavailable in my dictionary.2. About fingerprint scanner it is quiet good but just hopping to be little faster, (Personal opinion) may be it is because of on display scanner some micro seconds delayed would be there.3. Popup camera is best in class, face recognition is simply awesome.4. Battery backup is ok you get whole-day utilization time if you are a frequent user.5. Last thing the built quality & design is simply awesome. One has to be only careful for accidentally dropping on backside & on display corners because of it curve display.Cons:-1. No headphone jack 3.5mm one has to buy c-type converter or c-type headphone.2. Its very difficult to put tempered glass for curve screen mobiles i have tried twice perfect fitting is impossible.\n\n', "\n\n  Let's start with the first thing that you would notice - size.It's a big phone, yeah. But, after 2 weeks you won't notice. It will feel just perfect in hand (if you don't use a cover on this). With a cover, it's still alright. And yeah, I've been using Galaxy S7 and Lg G7, meaning small phones, always. So yeah, size won't bother you and it feels as premium as a phone can get.Next, Display - I compared the display to S10, S10 Plus, Note 9, Pixel, iPhone. I love this display in every aspect. Everything will always look better. Maybe because of the larger size or actual display quality, I don't know. It's the best I've had. Outdoor visibility is a little less (only when you compare with others), but it will get the job done easily.Battery - Do not go through online review. It'll last a full day easily on heavy use. I'm getting a day and a half - 4 hrs Sot with 32-38 hrs or 7+ hours sot on weekends with a 18-22 hrs standby. Even it doesn't; You won't ever feel it. Charges in no time, Doesn't heats up while charging (even when you're using it). It's getting better after each day.Camera - Again, getting better after each update. I'm on android 10 open beta preview and you get all the features that you want. Every function enabled on each sensor. Default setting is great, detailed images, perfect balance. And, when you want to tweak, Pro mode is there. You don't need anything else when it comes to cameras. Btw, when comparing the pictures between S10 and 7 Pro, you'll like the 7 pro just cause of the display.Performance - Do I really need to review this? Just cut the animation scale to 0.5x in developer mode and it feels crazy. Not a single hiccup so far. This is the best performer in the industry.You won't get better experience than this. You may buy other flagships because you though the camers might be better or battery or blah blah. This the best thing in the market right now. Or, just wait for the 7T pro. 1 months maybe. Best thing ever.But, get a framless cover for 500, it will maintain the sleek feel of the phone. Don't try any uv screenguards, they are horrible. Use the stock screenguard or simple protectors.Cheers!\n\n", "\n\n  The phone is super amazing.. It is a little heavy compared to other models from One Plus but that's not a complaint as the phone is real fast with great and simple features.. The finger print scanner is not that great as most of the times I have to input my password due to lockage from trying several times. I think they need to work a lot on this.. Camera quality is super good and even the night pictures turn out to be fabulous.Has a great battery life.. Based on my usage I'm getting around 12-15 hours.. But I need not to worry as the phone charges super quick.!Initially there were a few call drops but I think the issue is fine now..The best part about the phone is it's speakers! Dolby surround is just out of the World and you get a theater experience while watching videos or even music for that matter..OnePlus could have provided some basic headphones with this phone as it does not have a jack.. But i think you can get a good wireless headphone for around 2000 which will solve your problem..\n\n", '\n\n  I was littlebit sceptical after reading some genera and negative reviews about it on the amazon as well as on YouTube...but after i used for 2 days ...i am loving it... camera has gone better after latest update ...and.....and this thing is pure Butter. Go for it....Best in its  class....not regretting a penny in 49k i spent....no issues yet\n\n', '\n\n  Waited 5 year to buy new phone after using Samsung note 3.Can say it was worth waiting.With this price tag and feature I consider this as perfect purchase.Main feature.Screen A+Speed SD 855Looks..even mirror grey look perfect90hz refresh rateBatteryDisappointedCameraScreen is quiet large\n\n', "\n\n  The worst experience. You can't play heavy games like PUBG and COD and even use Youtube for a long time because there comes over heating! They say there is a cooler inside.. But. I don't feel so. Screen keeps freezing while I play games due to this heating problem. Other apps keep closing automatically! I couldn't even share pics via WhatsApp cuz it started to load the pic forever! Still my hands are heating.. Never ever buy this crap.. go for a Samsung seriously.\n\n", "\n\n  Was waiting for a good deal on S10, meanwhile OP7Pro was launched so I bought it on the first day it started selling, Amazon delivered the same day. Great service. I received and installed 2 updates, and having used it for a week plus, I can say it's been a mixed experience. Some features work well, others dont. So here's my impression for you.Good:1. Large and sharp LED screen with good legibility. Watching videos is fun. The on screen FP sensor is fast and conveniently located, no delays or misses.2. Dual speakers with clear sound, though music quality through speakers is just about OK.3. Fast and zippy, be it apps, games or file transfers. Doesnt get hot while playing games or charging4. Really fast charging. Fully charged in an hour!5. Oxygen OS is minimal and easy to use. The popup selfie camera is quicker than I expected.6. Haptic feedback is very refined. I used to turn it off on phones. On this one, it's on.The bad:1. The curved edges make it more slippery and the image on the edges reflect and appear distorted, any element there is hard to touch. Collects fingerprint marks easily. I dont find the missing notch makes any huge difference in my usage.2. There is no headphone socket on the phone, no USB-C headphone or adapter in the box3. The selfie camera is average, The rear triple camera setup isnt great as advertised. The main camera is good but gives inconsistent results.The Ugly1. Handling the phone because of it's weight, size and top heaviness, slipperiness.2. Battery life is a shame for a 4000mAh. Bringing down refresh rate and screen resolution made it a bit better, but it's still a one day phone at best.3. Wide angle lens is low on detail, not too wide yet creates distortion4. Not VFM at this price. Its should have been 6-8k cheaper for that.My impression is, this is a phone that only huge screen lovers should go for. The rest should wait for OP7, check if its battery life isnt as bad as this, and go for 8/256 version, still saving 11k over oneplus 7 pro. Else wait for s10/s10+ discount sale. I regret I didnt wait for S10 to be discounted.\n\n", '\n\n  Bang for the buck, superb design, top quality speaker, fantastic camera, just one drawback no 3.5mm headphone jack, but expect that  FANTASTIC DEAL\n\n', "\n\n  With standard use the phone simply died within a month form purchase. Something that you don't expect with a 52k flagship. I have logged a ticket with support and only the resolution they provide may help change the rating..\n\n", "\n\n  though the phone is heavily loaded but there are certain things which it lacks and is required by most of the common users. having a high camera setup the phone still gives you an ok image which when compared to other flag ships is way less quality wise. i felt for such high end phones 4000mah battery is less, though 7 pro gives you decent 1 and half day back up on normal usage but same back gets reduced to a day or less on extensive usage. last but the most important is the head phone jack,  i was expecting one plus would provide c to 3mm jack connector like they did in case of one plus 6 and 6t. strange thing is they don't have enough inventory of the same.\n\n", "\n\n  The phone is a beast. I switched for iPhone to one plus. Not sure if you'll find a phone this fast and smooth. The 90hz is a treat to scroll through, you will feel the difference after using this phone and then switching to a different phone with a basic 60hz. The experience is just wonderful. The fingerprint even though is fast it's not necessarily consistent you'll sometimes need to keep trying to unlock the phone and the camera is decent at most, does the job most of the time. Video watching experience is absolutely wonderful, great battery life, you can expect a whole day even with considerable usage. Absolutely worth the money\n\n", '\n\n  I got a faulty product delivered and it was promptly repalced by the service center, good people at Chennai (Masood) and Bangalore (Anirudh) Service Centre. Overall the Phone is performing as expected worth the money spent. I am happy that one plus is backed by good service center executives.\n\n', "\n\n  \xa0Display is just smooth and so captivating you can actually play videos of 60 fps & 120 fps on this on full screen mode and the Dolby digital sounds is just crystal clear and the fanatic mode i don't if it's available on lower variants but being the 12 gb variant I must say it is the most powerfull device for gaming, photography, videos , performance, you name it\n\n", "\n\n  Product is awesome but delivery was delayed.the first thing you'll notice is that it is blazing fast. The camera pops up everytime for facial unlock which looks a little bothering somehow otherwise this phone is power packed. Battery life will go on for more than a day for me easily with daily chores on my phone as I am not a gamer.\n\n", "\n\n  First of all, Let's talk about Negative FirstI should say that Oneplus Copied the Design from Samsung and This truly looks like S9 or something like that, its edge Display is the worst implementation, Overall Designiis good, but coming to Screen its really annoying why Oneplus opted for this. Who want a curved display..? If some one wants they will buy a Samsung.2. Weight if the product, it's really heavy this is also may be because if copying from Samsung.3. Warp Charger, it's to make us fools, really, when Charging Oneplus 6T and 7Pro, we surely notice that warp charger is another normal oneplus charger as both charges at same speed, what's the use of warp Circuit..? Still the speed is decent enough but not satisfactory for its name.4. Popup Camera, Of course Design wise it is an asset, but if Safety of Camera Considered then Popup camera takes out the points. If course they shown some circus tricks by weighing some stone to it, but they never shown how many times the motor can handle up and down of it..? If you use face unlock, that little thing pops up minimum 50 times a day and in long run.. Can it withstand..?Here Punch Hole Display is true Winner.Now coming to positives.1. Excellent Display, if we eliminate that edge Display fi a while and feel the 90hz Fluid AMOLED Display, then we really feel the smoothness of it, just like butter, and the Delivery of saturation, whites everything is natural and with vivid option it looks astonishing.2. Both Front and Rear Cameas work like pro, front camera gives pics with over Sharpness may be issue with resolution, but after processing they are good. Coming to Rear Camera, wide angle lens are not Doing its job perfectly, may be software issue, but still Potrait or normal works great, Quality is too good.3. In screen Fingerprint works really great, fast and no need to search for sensor.4. Battery Life, With Heavy Usage, 8hrs, with Moderate Usage,16hrs, with Normal Usage, 20+ hours and I got more than 48 hours of life with Light Usage. Battery backup is Decent when we combine all the draining factors like 6.6 inch Display, In Screen Finger Print, Quad HD Display, 90hz Refresh Rate and all.5. NO need to say about Performance, 855 processor says it all.Overall, It's a beast with some Drawbacks and I personally feel Oneplus crossed its limits by pushing its flagship killer mark to Flagship Competitor, Oneplus itself bought its destruction, sooner or later its greediness to takeover the market makes it vulnerable and make it extinct, I think this is my Last Oneplus Device as surely they will go beyond 60k from next mobile.They say some Quality Comes with a price to pay..My question is why can't this be applied to Samsung and Apple when Oneplus introduced Oneplus One..?Am writing This review after using the mobile for 4 days.Thank you.\n\n", '\n\n  I am a OnePlus device die hard fan. This is my 5th OP handset. OP 1,OP 2,OP 3, OP 5 and now the fully upgraded OP 7 Pro. The best part is OnePlus has at last listened to the customer demand and tried to fulfil almost every aspact except few which are not mandtory or deal breaker. OnePlus is OnePlus and no body can beat the performance, charging durability, updates etc.\n\n', '\n\n  Monster phone with build in powerhouse in this budget.Great flagship killer mobile with Awesome look in this price range, i will not explain more about the specification bcoz its already mentioned in descriptionbut as per my personal experience i love very much this mobile phone compare to other Android devices.In Term of Battery this is wonderful and with Dash charging this gives an extra advantage.In Term of Performance this is Beast\n\n', "\n\n  Finally I could lay my hand on the Almost perfect high end smartphone,let me explain...Delivery-Superfast one day between the order and my possession, inference- I would suggest oneplus to be Amazon exclusive,they are doing their best for the buying experience of OnePlus products, actually I went to Reliance digital calicut they had no proper stock on the launch week and they were unware of any offers on OnePlus simply horrible experience.Unboxing-This is my first OnePlus phone my previous phone was Apple iPhone xs I was reluctant a bit before unboxing but boy I literally loved it when I laid my hands on this beast,few words from my initial experience,the tactile feel on the back of the phone is something which I have never experienced till date it's a sort of butterly silky matte gradient blue which you should experience to believe it,it's a hot looking phone specially in this nebula blue colour second only to oppo Reno ocean green which I feel is the hottest looking smartphone of this season,build quality is impeccable worthy of a flagship,few things about accessories Travel Adaptor is very huge will be a sore thing to carry around but charges at blazing speeds,Good quality flashy red data cable,an above average pausible soft back case which fits perfectly with some of not full protection,Some people had said in their review about airbubles under screen gaurd and poor application of the screen gaurd and all which had put worries in my mind but trust me guys it's so very professionally put which I would bet you can't get it done anywhere near it by a local screen gaurd vendor even upon microscopic examination I couldn't find any air bubbles or imperfections.User Experience-in just one word it's awesome,which none of the Android flagships could dare promising it to their fans at twice the cost of this phone,with just one update till date no issues at all, battery life is very good even after setting the display for 90hz,and boy 90hz display you should experience to believe it, scrolling,navigating everything is buttey smooth because of this 90hz,the fastest 256gb storage on any smartphone till date is blazing fast,Audio is good but not the best,Camera is again Good but not the best but livable,only one last and important thing I missed from OnePlus is the good quality type c earphone as I couldn't find a good qualityone on any online sites but no gripes,the pricing by OnePlus erases every little blemishes clearly to leave a Champion on this arena,thanks OnePlus and Amazon love you both.\n\n", "\n\n  I have seen plenty of reviews with praises on the phone's hardware or the software. And both are awazing. An apple like integration of hardware and software. A beast at its heart. Enough RAM to handle multiple apps without a hiccup. No heating issues. Long battery life. Brilliant screen. What more do you need?My shout-out to the Oneplus team that is working non-stop on improving the user experience.

However from a software perspective, one must mention, the oxygen os tops everything I have used. Minimally intrusive, maximally productive. The touches are thoughtful and subtle. One plus adheres to the Android design philosophy and adds functionality that one needs. No unnecessary bloat from functionality that I would use an app for. The migrate app is awesome. The features one feels are the ones that Android would absorb in the future. Similar to what Motorola promised before Lenovo started killing it off.\n\n', "\n\n  some people says camera is not good.

On receiving the box we have the same excitement but this time the phone would not get 'on' and show a set up software problem as seen in the screen shot uploaded. This is really frustrating that a phone of this cost will even fail to start , what to say of other features. It seems that the quality of these phones have taken a serious beating. I have requested for replacement. The company must look into such problems as they are very irritating and will dent their image severely.\n\n", "\n\n  I have some minor issue with this phone. Firstly the screen guard. The phone is 45K+ but the inbuilt screen guard was as cheap as hell plastic guard. Got so many scratches after 2-3 days of minimum usage to the point where it doesn't feels like it was bought a week ago. Don't bother selling a phone worth 45K and no proper screen guard.Secondly, the touch doesn't reponds sometimes. I have to close the apps and then it starts working again and it's really frustrating.Thirdly, the Bluetooth stops working sometimes too when you want to share some files.Fourthly, the camera. It's not as good as I expected it to be. 48MP but the quality is not there. Shouldn't the pictures be more defined and detailed.\n\n", "\n\n  Except for display there isn't any stand out feature.

Display is gorgeous. I am not very particular with the camera but still it's good in day light shots. Haptic feedback is very good. Easy to use the alert slider.While setting up the phone with data transfer from old phone felt the temperature was high even though there is liquid cooling system. But then it's only one time process and never felt the heat later.It's very huge and heavy. After using this phone and when used my old OnePlus 5T I could feel how thick and heavy this phone is compared to 5T which is so slim. I think OnePlus has to reduce the weight of the phone and also reduce the size to 5.5 inches fire another category of users.\n\n", "\n\n  first time when i on this phone it show system not responding dialog and when i call amazon then send technician and technician do hard reset that phone then it is working but today(25 july 2020) exact after one month phone off automatically its not getting onSo i suggest don't buy one plus ever bcz they make fool to customers.#worst phone ever#not value for money\n\n", "\n\n  I was just as excited as anyone buying this model of Oneplus. It is very fluid but the screen difference is not that noticable. The system performs quite well and attention to small details make it feel nice. The OS as such doesn't have any new feature since android, i think is reaching its limit. So the performance tuning is wat is concentrated on and that has been adequately. Only major drawback i feel is in the department of the camera as it is not upto the mark. Initially at first glance it looks all nice and good, but the minute you start to zoom into it then it looks worthless.

The camera quality does not match at all even with 6t. The touch and screen display cteates a lot of problem. On day two of using this phone, the screen suddenly turnee black. I was unable to unclock the phone or see any screen. All i could see was the clock display. And then the finger print sensors were displayed. I could not restart the phone as well for a long time.

Good work Oneplus.From two days of experience (will edit comment if anything new comes up):Pros:Everything in the news hold true -1. Good looking large screen - fun to use a truly full screen phone.2. Overall build of the phone is great - thought it would be too heavy (200gm) to use but it is not so.3. Battery does hold up for up to 1.5 days on a single charge (I'm a moderate user)4. Camera is decent. I currently switch between GCam and Default camera apps depending on what I'm shooting. Better to have both installed and available for your use.Cons:Again, the news holds true.1. Ghost touches: The issues reported on ghost touches does occur. But this happens only occasionally, does not bother you much.2: Weak speaker - when set to Max phone volume, it's feels less pleasant to hear. Must ensure that it is not set at full volume.3. Phone hangs/stutters when re-used after a long break. Not sure if this is android's fault or oneplus'Current verdict: This is one of the best phones out there, pricey but effective.

It remains to be seen if subsequent models will become serious competition while remaining at the same price point.As an avid fan of mobile photo/video, this phone is usable but still not quite where I would expect it to be at this price point.All in all, it\'s an okay phone for the money, but if you\'re concerned about having quality computational photography, noise-free/artifact-free video, etc, you\'re better off going with the Pixel 4 (even my pixel 2 XL takes higher quality photo/video with far lower noise and artifacting) or spending a little more for the Galaxy.If having high quality photo or video doesn\'t rank as high on your list of needs then you will very likely really enjoy this phone and for the price I would definitely recommend it.If high quality photo/video is high on your list of needs, I recommend taking a pass on this phone; It\'s definitely not for the photo/video enthusiast.\n\n', '\n\n  Dear all.

I was planning on purchasing the OnePlus 7T pro...  But I realized there is negligible difference in both the products...

And if you're a OnePlus lover then you already know that it's worth every penny....Screen looks amazing... Pop up camera works great... onscreen Fingerprint is faster than previous OnePlus devices... Camera is not the best but it can be ranked in the top 10... Definitely better than majority of Android smart phones.. a good quality product...That's the reason it's called Pro\n\n", '\n\n  The main reason why i bought this phone is my old C9 Pro broke and i needed a phone with good Display which can support HDR 10,Then i gone with the hype and finally bought this phone.but i got the problem with the display itself üò™ I wanted a phone with a gud display when i didn\'t get whta i want for so what do i do with the rest of the specs.After playing any 4K/HDR content ylloew color is appearing on the whole screen even when i put the screen calibration "Cold".And when i on the reading mode its worse ....all dispaly is seems like someone spreaded Turmeric Powder on it & its not bright as many samsung\'s phones.i have been using my old samsung c9 pro for 3yeras and i knw it.Being a movie lover i luv watching movies in my phone. Totally disappointed with the display.OnePlus should update thier dispaly next time with more brighter screen.\n\n', "\n\n  The phone is just wonderful! Although the phone was released almost exactly a year ago, it shows no sign of slowing down. The screen is just wonderful, and at its current price point, it's a bargain. Flagship quality for half the price. It misses out on very few features (like wireless charging, but I wouldn't really have used it with Warp Charge, so no complaints from me here) and the camera isn't the best (much better from when it was initially released, the camera captures everything quite naturally, if you give it good lighting though. Low light photography isn't great (especially compared to the iPhone 11 Pro, although that costs over twice what this one costs.) The screen is absolutely mesmerizing! Gets quite bright, but not the brightest. Not overally saturated, color reproduction is quite accurate. In-display fingerprint scanner is as fast as any normal fingerprint scanner, which is great news. OxygenOS is clean and beautiful. An awesome wrapper over android. No bloatware (except a couple of Oneplus Apps which come pre-installed, which are usually deletable). Overall, the best value for money right now (and for the near future as well). Do buy this over the Oneplus 7t or the 8!Enough said about the phone, the delivery process was quite disappointing. Amazon delivery agents don't know how to handle the exchange process. They have no idea how to navigate through the process specified, and wasted almost half an hour of my time, just to give me my phone. I've faced a similar issue with another phone I got delivered recently, and the experience this time around was even worse. Hope they change it soon.\n\n", "\n\n  It's an amazing phone. The performance is outstanding. Little big for men pocket but overall package is awesome. Thanks OnePlus team. üòäThanks and regards,Rishi Ratan Singh,Indian Army.\n\n", "\n\n  \xa0It is very good product. But only one negative point that the price of the phone is high and we don't get earphones also. I thought they would give a normal earphones. And it doesn't have earphone jack so it should provide some other thing so that we  can connect our normal earphones.battery drains very fast.the overcome this they have provided nice charger but it is of no use if we are out of the house we cannot charge it.\n\n", "\n\n  I have purchased this phone last week.Very fast in performance with no lags at all.Battery backup also good supported with ultra fast charging.Awesome camera and screen quality.Little big in size and heavy in weight, it will take around one week to get settle and use to it. So no worries for size and weight.Overall its a must buy phone if ur budget is around 50K. Apple and Samsung can't compete with one plus quality.\n\n", '\n\n  forget about the teaser where oneplus7 is dropped in water. My oneplus7pro exposed to rain for 10 mins and it started flickering and screen damaged.Request all not to take that company video seriously and be careful in monsoon season avoid taking pics with such good camera\n\n', '\n\n  Two of the reasons for buying OnePlus 7 Pro were battery life and space. Although Notes app is not pretty much impressive, I need this app to store my ideas and write-ups (I am into professional writing). Moreover, the phone offers 256GB space at a lower cost than any iPhone would provide. For the same storage space in any Apple device, I would have to spend more than 55K. OR I had to choose an older iPhone, which I never wanted to do. So OnePlus 7 Pro was my choice. I can store my data (documents, photos, and videos). Fingerprint, sometimes, needs two-three taps and sometimes, I have to use passcode to unlock the device. But this is OK as long as it is not a daily trouble. If you are into writing or any other creative field, wherein you have to store some data, go for it. And yes, the strong battery. Even if I use mobile data, the battery lasts pretty long...and with its warp charger, it charges quickly. Like the double-tap to wake screen feature...\n\n', '\n\n  Over all it is a good phone. Upgrading from oneplus 3t to oneplus 7 Pro. Battery life is the best thing which I felt in this mobile. But there are a few problems with this phone which I encountered in nearly one month of usage.1) Fingerprint scanner not working sometimes :  I do not know whether it is happening to others as well, but when I try to unlock the phone, sometimes the fingerprint scanner is disabled and I have to use the pattern to unlock the screen. It happened a lot in this first one month of the usage.2) Camera is over beautifying the  pics taken. Most of the times when you click a photo, you looks over beautified than the actual person. The depth of the photo is getting compromised in this way. slightly dark colored people like me will get a shook  when you see the first photo of yourself. :D.  Also pics taken from the ultra wide lens are distorted when you zoom a little bit.\n\n', '\n\n  I bought this product because of series name 7 earlier I was using Oneplus 5 since last 2 n half year.After usage of one month .. here is my view.1. Camera is not good as they have done advertisement.2. Warp charging very fast.3. Heating hanging issue while you are using Facebook Live or Facebook Messenger.4. Selfie Camera is poor.5. Not value for money it should be around 42000 maximum  .6. Overall if you are one plus lover just wait for price drop in coming days because sale is not good of One plus 7 pro due to lots of issues and performance.\n\n', "\n\n  Screen is great & treat to watch movies & videos. Don't really feel difference of 90hz. Software has glitches & apps crash sometimes. Bought fone after seeing camera ratings on Dox, but to my surprise the quality is very very average & portrait mode struggle a lot with image quality under good artificial lighting. Overall unimpressed with the fone after paying 50k. Hoping software updates will solve the issue. If want oneplus Suggest to buy cheaper 7t else of budget is good go for Samsung s10.\n\n", '\n\n  One of the best phone i have ever bought. In fact i have been a fan of Oneplus since 3 years. My first phone from Oneplus was Oneplus 3 which is still performing amazing though it has been 3 years. Good thing about Oneplus 7 pro is it has got everything you need unlike the other phones which is cheap but comes with bloatware, which literally sucks. My rates are below.Camera - 9/10Speed - 10/10Sound - 10/10Resolution - 10/10Fingerprint and Face recognize - 10/10Over all - 10/10Also, the best part is i bought it when there was better offer available from Amazon, which was like 12,000. On top of this i spent about 1,500 for the screen protection which keeps it safe from the damage. Protection Pro which is made from rubber material mostly used by 3M works really well on your phones.Overall i am happy customer of amazon as well as OnePlus.\n\n', "\n\n  After using a month Not worth it 50k, user experience is smooth but battery life is really disappointed it only last up to 3 to 4 hour if gaming 2.3 hour very bad warp charge is fake it almost take 1.3 hour even real me 3 pro charge faster it heat up while charging. Camera are not that good redmi note 7pro take same quality of image something even take a better pic than a 50k cellphone what the fcck wrong with oneplus image processing and video recording are not good in low light.

My views :Pros :- Display quality is amazing & enjoying it- Speed is extremely good- Camera is very good- Some of the features are good in this modelCons :- Battery life is not good. Need lot's of improvements in battery optimization- In adaptive brightness the screen brightness doesn't change automatically (even if you set it) many a time. You have to manually switch the adaptive brightness off & then on, then the screen will change the brightness. This might be a bug, which OnePlus needs to resolve- In the new pc received I found bubbles on screen guard provided- Weight of the product is highUsing it for more than 15 days now & I am loving it inspite of few negative points, being a OnePlus lover. But the company has to improve the product in many ways & we expect the updated in the near future.\n\n", '\n\n  Very smooth and buttery.....I am a big fan of OnePlus phones and the performance of this phone completely blown me off.....Good Job OnePlus team.....keep it up....üëç\n\n', "\n\n  Simple good at these price segment i will be waiting so long to get it but whrn i get these phone in lockdown after 2 months the waiting worth these productsAbout phoneIt's all about display.... those who wnat best display must go for it... you definitely observed get different in between rog 2 and OP 7 pro ya  you sacrifices more battery and air trigger bt you got more in these phone water resistant and and camera get huge difference in both\n\n", '\n\n  Writing review after a weekPros :- Worth buying it.- Premium look and design- Lightweight and fast Oxygen OS- Display quality is awesome specially one can feel difference of 90Hz refresh rate vs 60Hz- Best experience for playing games and videos on QHD+ fluid AMOLED- Sound quality is best with Dolby Atmos- Battery life is really good. With full battery it works for more than a day with moderate use of phone with gaming & watching videos- Camera quality is not up to a mark compared to other flagship phones but better than its previous version 6TCons :- No 3.5 mm headphone jack- No IP rating for water resistance- Slightly bigger in size- Slightly heavy in weight- Ghost touch on cornors. Hope this would be resolved in upcoming software updates.\n\n', "\n\n  Pro:- Display- Performance- Great in display fingerprint reader- Awesome fnatic mode for gamers- Zen mode for the ones who uses phone too much- Great low light photography- Great camera quality (after recent update)- Really nice portrait mode- Super fast wrap charging- The pop-up camera, one must admit it's pretty cool- heptic feedback makes gaming experience better for supported app.- great stereo soundCons:- Battery life is not great but the super fast wrap charging compensate that.- Some times photos are not great, might need some tweaking to get that great shot.\n\n", "\n\n  Awesome and excellent phone....Delivery is quick in 2 days..The only con is it is a bit heavy.. But the fantastic screen makes u forget about that...And u need to use a case. As it is heavy if it falls accidentally there are more chances of getting damaged..Regarding charging 30w charger is superb..Battery draining is not so fast.. An average user can get a ful day charge easily...I don't use camera much... I used Asus zenfone 5z and LG v30 plus previously both are flagship phones at that time. But the camera quality is very nice here compared to both of them..Fingerprint reader is also fast and smooth.. I don't use face unlock bcoz it takes a little time and need to swipe to get the pop up camera open..Got a transparent case in the box.. It is of good quality but it doesn't give a good look to ur mobile. So better to buy a back cover online..Display is very smooth.. Watching movies and videos Is awesome... It's very bright and got no problems in watching under direct sunlight..Not too many customizations we can find here in oxygen os..Coming to stereo speakers, they are good and decent but not as loud as zenfone 5z..As there is no headphone jack I had ordered Bluetooth earphones.. They are on the way and had to use them to write review about sound quality..Played PUBG and other big games without any lag.. Runs very smooth.. As it is 12GB ram all the games and apps we use they Wil be in the ram without getting closed..The phone may gets heated up definitely if we use camera for more time or play non stop games.. That Wil be very common with any mobile..You need to be very careful as it is very heavy it is slippery too.. So u need to definitely use a case for that..My final verdict is if you don't have problem with it's weight then it is the best flagship phone right now in the market at this price.. Lack of wireless charging and headphone jack is not a problem to me.. It has the best screen till now..Am writing now after 20 days of use now.. I observed it's hanging sometimes when playing some small games which I did not get any prblm with big games. I don't know why.. Despite of having 12gb ram why it's hanging.. I hope it Wil be resolved in future updates..And one more thing is proximity sensor is not working properly a lot of times during calls leading to accidental touches which is irritating.. Hope everything Wil be solved in future updates..Thank you...\n\n", '\n\n  \xa0Please see the attached video. This was my first oneplus purchase. I purchased it on 20th Oct in sale and prepaid 42000. Got it on 24th and as you see it had faulty Android and hanging issue. I was unable to do even initial setup. NOW AMAZON REMOVED THEIR RETURN POLICY. so you can not directly return it, one TAPORI technician will come and he will check whether mobile is really having any issue or not. Trust me he was one of the most unprofessional person I met in my life. But some how he understood my problem and forwarded the issue to Amazon team. So now my replacement will come in next week.CONCLUSION: I paid 42000 on 20th Oct and I got working mobile on 4th of Nov. This is worst service by Amazon and worst product of Oneplus. Never gone buy any oneplus product again.\n\n', "\n\n  I am using OnePlus phone since last 4 years and it was 5th OnePlus phone in my whole family.

Battery gets consumed so quickly even if phone is not in use.3. Charging is not at per WRAP technology.4. Sometimes, phone goes off network even Network shows full. Have to do Flight mode ON/OFF to get network activated.5. Touch on screen is not that much responsive as OnePlus phone should be.6. Speaker mode goes on Hang state.Request OnePlus team to please replace my handset.\n\n", "\n\n  Reviewing after 2 weeks of use .Camera - Great shots in day light. Portrait sometimes didn't blur all the things in bg. Low light photoes are more then okey. Great video shooting quality. 4k at 30 and 60 fps.Fingerprint sensor- you have to put complete thumb which u registered otherwise it won't register. Overall 90% of times it works.Gaming is great. No need to discuss about  screen quality.Phone is amazingly fast.Battery backup is quite less but it charges blazing fast.I didn't feel anything different as I can charge it for 1 hr and it goes from 30 to 90%.U can adjust in the settings for improved battery life .Viewing movies is soo good on this phone as its speaker is great.

Hats off.I have given 4 star ideally should have given 4.5 out of 5 but no fractional marking.Pros...-Wonder physical look both back side dual tone nebula blue and front display really good with smooth flow over the edges.

Hope they will correct in 7T Pro.-Sound quality stereo speakers good.Cons...-Finger print reader requires full finger coverage not touch and go type which was a case for my earlier Honor View 10.-Biggest disappointing is that such a high quality product but such a cheap plastic cover? Such things are acceptable for 25k product not from a product have values nearly 60k.- No ear phone or even a type C to 3.5 mm converter. That I have ordered from Amazon. Hence could not experience real quality of listening to music.- No cleaning micro cloth- The charger is so big it covers the next socket area on switch board and when this phone is getting charged I cannot use next socket.-Selfie experience is not good, photos get heavily distorted on edges.- 206 gm a bit heavy on shirt pockets should have been below 200gms.- No expandable memory my old micro sd is now useless.- 12GB RAM does not give extra storage on devices, exactly do not know why 8GB and 12 GB cost difference is 6k. Samsung gives higher storage with higher RAM.\n\n', "\n\n  Great phone. I wanted this phone to play pubg. It's buttery smooth! Love the haptic feedbacks, as of now it may only work for pubg. Battery life is not that good. But definitely not bad. The camera quality for a phone at this price range could have been better... Since this phone does not have 3.5 mm jack you can't charge and play. Either have to but the adapter or the One Plus Bullets. It's priced at 1,409/- which is definitely overpriced for it's slightly above average performance... I bought this phone for the display and the Snapdragon 855. If you don't mind the chin and notch you can definitely go for the Asus rog that's got better stats.

Just happy to use this.....(iPhone x user)\n\n", "\n\n  This is my second OnePlus after using OnePlus 3 for a couple of years. Battery life is so good that I don't have to worry about charging the phone with extensive use. OnePlus lacks a lot when it comes to Camera performance, though 7 pro Cameras are much better than OnePlus 3, still they lack the performance expected of mobile cameras.Apart from the camera, it is a great phone to use.\n\n", '\n\n  This product proves to be a flagship in everyway although it doesn\'t offer some of many features in other mainstream phones, it more than keeps up with and actually overcomes such phone\'s "limitations" this is a really innovative phone with some unique features but it also lacks to offer comfortability in many cases such as one handed use is very hard because of its weight and thickness. Phone gets hot if I play games like pubg in QHD+ and 90hz display mode with fnatic mode one(it is a built in feature to improve gaming experience and it does improve noticeably my 8n game frame rate reduced 10ms) and gets really hot if I play two more games and it burns through battery. The battery life otherwise is pretty good easily lasts a "day" (more than 7 hours) with normal to heavy usage (I use it with screen turned on for 6 hours with half brightness 90hz and FHD+ display with volte data ebabled, in that 6 hours 3 hours of continuous online gaming 2 and half hours of watching online videos while traveling and the remaining 1 hour just aimlessly scrolling the refresh rate is something else). Camera quality is something else especially the video I prefer to take snapshots from video if I should be taking videos like in a concert or something but the low light camera performance is a little disappointing because it doesn\'t have motion capture and the evening images look shaky because of it and also the lens is affected by stray lights leaving a lens flare often which would be cool with sunlight but street light and reflection of tubelight from a puddle of water can be really annoying. I would\'ve really liked if we could choose various lenses for video but it seems to capture video from the main lens onle. Charging is amazing, it is exactly as advertised so do check the promotion video. No screen protector from oneplus although thier cases are good. I would recommend u buying a 3.5 mm jack adapter because no bluetooth headphones are worth it if you play a lot of games like me ( bluetooth latency is a beach) not even aptx low latency headphones can compete with your gaming if you turn on fnatic mode. Audio quality and clarity is great but output volume is a little low in bluetooth speaker and headphones in phone speakers are almost good as a TV but much crisp and clearer. Final points I\'m using this phone for the last 2 months it is a lot of fun and useful but a pain to hold it for more than 20 mins because of the thickness, design and weight phone is really slippery despite the weight and looks I would recommend a good case from oneplus itself.\n\n', "\n\n  I have purchase 8 GB varient on 24-06-19 and within 3 or 4 days I found following defects :-1. Battery backup is very poor. It drains very fast.2. OnePlus claimed super strong conactivity, but according to me it is only satisfactory.3. Cost of this product is very high.4. I contacted customer care within 4 days of purchase for replacement. But they refused.So guys if you want to purchase costly phone. Think deeply about the negetive side. So please read all customers reviews carefully and then finalise. Once product received, you can't do anything.\n\n", '\n\n  Well, there is nothing to dislike about this device. I own the 8GB Ram version of OnePlus7Pro. But, OnePlus could‚Äôve delayed the launch of OnePlus7TPro. Within a couple of months, your phone is no longer the flagship even though the device was launched less that 3 months ago of my purchase.Note:1. Camera is above average but not among the flagships of other brands.2. Display is amazing. I‚Äôve not experienced anything like it before.3. Just received an update for Android 10.4. OnePlus needs to reconsider gap between launching flagship devices.\n\n', "\n\n  It's a very good phone, screen is amazing it even looks fluidic when screen off. Performance is good. Battery is decent though. Lasts a day with manual Qhd and 90hz. Hope snapdragon invents a much faster processor.The 3x optical zoom can really take macro shots and it's amazing. I just love this display every time I look at it. Have to buy type C to 3.5 mm if you want to connect your headset, Use OnePlus connecter coz only that will give you high resolution audio and higher sound and bass output (as Bluetooth headsets generally do not have the capacity for too much bass output). I bought one 3rd party adapter type C to 3.5mm+ charging port but it's audio quality is not high resolution. So I bought oneplus 3.5mm connector now.The phone charges up fast as well.Manually select 48 MP for perfect shots. Install GCam if you prefer warmer colour tones.\n\n", "\n\n  People write review instant after they buy and use the product for few days. But this review is coming after 8 months usage of One Plus 7Pro. I had One Plus 5 earlier and so I thought of going with 7Pro. I would say this phone is no match for the earlier version. This phone hangs a lot and updates are pathetic. Seems like One plus is trying to do too much on this phone or something is wrong that they are not able to fix.  Though it iss said to be their fastest phone but I find non reason on why it hangs or freeze.After using this phone my confidence on higher models is shaky. So don't go with the wave of impressive advts. Check for the real user reviews.Camera was better in One Plus 5. You need to edit the pics clicked indoors to make them brighter and colourful.Battery life is just okay but you need to keep your brightness in control.Design is good but that's not the only thing that you would buy an expensive phone for.If with 80GB storage space as balance it starts lagging or freezing then what happens if the you are low on space like 10GB. It was almost unusable when it was that low on storage. I had to clean it out. So even if you buy a 256 GB phone just make sure you have enough storage left.This is my personal view and points. Use your own judgement and knowledge to evaluate the phone.\n\n", "\n\n  Camera quality is not good as one plus advertise in their website.  Display is outstanding. Fingerprint sensor is good. Getting an average of one day battery life if it is fully charged. Speakers are not up to the mark. There is  No wireless charging, no IPS certification and still one plus is saying this phone is a flagship killer. I can agree this product is one of the fastest mobiles in the planet. But, if you are not a heavy game player, there is no point in this. Just go for other  less expensive Chinese phones like Mi or vivo.  The price range  is absolutely ridiculous...!  Don't loss your reputation among youngsters like me..Please..\n\n", "\n\n  One plus 7 Pro is truly a beautiful phone just fell in love with the phone when I got my hands on it, I'm using the phone since 2 days, I want to say a lot of positive things about the phone but I'll make it short, this phone exceeds my expectations in all aspects, just go for it, a great buy, I'll highly recommend it.\n\n", "\n\n  Simply a worthy premium smartphone for daily use. Have been using it for almost 4+ months. 90Hz display is amazing and smooth (one of my favourite these days). On screen fingerprint is fast enough for unlocking the phone. Unfortunately, i didn't used face unlock and i didn't use front camera often. So no comments on that.With 30W Warp Charge, the 4000mAh battery can be recharged pretty fast as well (as per the company's claim and its working excellent so far).Camera is working as expected and also tried few nightmode shots and it is also satisfying.No troublesome heating issues found so far.There is no headphone jack, but i don't have any problem with that as I am using OnePlus Bullet Wireless 2 (Excellent choice for OnePlus7Pro).Ps:- This is my first OnePlus company's product and I simply loved everything about it.\n\n", "\n\n  I got this for 46k after offer also got 1 year screen replacement guaranty free, so accordingly, this phone is value for money.Pros -1 Looks are great2 Camera provide enough details as needed3 Fingerprint sensor is damn fast as  compared to samsung ultrasonic fp reader.4 popup camera motor is fast and i sometime miss to see popup while it unlocks phone with face unlock.5 battery at Qhd resolution 90 htz display provide 4.5 hours screen on time (a day usage including standby), Qhd 60 htz provide 5.5 hours and Full Hd 60 htz provide 6 hours Screen on Time. On an average i get a full day usage easily.6 weight distrubution is excellent that phones doesn't feel heavy in hand.Cons:low light camera performance is ok ok.\n\n", "\n\n  I have been using 8GB variant for 3 months.Before this one  , i had OP 5t. 5t never had heating issues whereas this phone gets heated with continuous use.The only pros of upgrading to 7pro from 5t is quality of display , bezel less display , screen size. But 7 pro is not up to the mark in terms of camera performance. Below average camera. It sometimes clicks good picture under good light conditionsMost of the times i use FHD+ display to save battery and i hardly switch to QHD+ which doesn't really make much difference.Finger print reader is fine.

Sometime feels like the touch is not working and suddenly after 10-15 sec or more, the phone goes into calling mode.3) Voice disturbances-many instances, when the call is made, voice is not transmitted.4) CAMERA- even after the update the back camera is still blurred. Indoors it take decent photography but not up to the mark of a flagship killer (as these are called). The focus is bad. In potrait (depth) mode background is not blurred.I have been following OnePlus community forums and these problems are common all across. Also different people are getting different issues.Would really like to get money back. But the option for refund or replacement wasn't available initially and now it shows refund period closed on 30th may. Looks like a cheap stunt to force the products on the consumers.\n\n", '\n\n  1.

I have used 5T and 6T both and I never faced this issue but it's completely annoying and disappointing that a phone would die like this on just the second day. Additionally I didn't quite like the battery life, even when I am not using it, the phone seems to be losing a lot of charge. The other issue I faced was I tried the smart Lock feature and used my finger print lock and also the pattern lock. The fone would automatically lock itself even when I am watching you tube or using the fone. This was like annoying to the heights.

My only complain is the camera. In this price of phone you expect really good camera. Unfortunately that's not the case. Camera is just average.

Before that I was using OnePlus1, So I am part of OnePlus community for almost past 5 years. Therefore, I have witnessed the journey of OnePlus in India from the beginning. Let's get into the details:1. Display - Amazing display with Fluid AMOLED and 90 Hz refresh rate. It is way better than OnePlus5 and OnePlus6 also. I haven't compared it with 6T. After using this phone for almost 2 weeks, I feel OnePlus5's display is dull and lifeless.2. Sound - The Dolby Atmos speakers are the best I have ever experienced in any phone. I compared the same with both OP5 and OP6 and there is a significant improvement in sound quality. The phone has speakers on both the sides but 85% sound comes from the bottom one.3. Battery Life - I haven't used the phone for extensive gaming; with moderate level of gaming (2 hrs.) and 3-4 hrs of screen time and 1.5 hrs of calling time it would easily give you 24 hrs. For cricket lovers, a full charge of phone will give you 70-75 overs with 70% volume.4. Camera - It is far better than OP5 and OP6, especially the low light clicks, but it could have been better for this price.5. Performance - I have never faced any problem with the performance of any OP phone and I am sure this phone will surpass your expectation.Downsides:1. It is very heavy compared to OP5, 206 gm, you'll feel the weight in your pocket2. There is no 3.5 mm earphone/headphone audio jack3. There is single type c jack for both audio and charging4. The finger print sensor is not as fast and smooth as the previous versions, but it has improved significantly after 2 system updates provided by OP. I hope it'll improve further with future updates5. The face unlock is quick but not quick like earlier phones, because of pop up front cameraThere are some teething problems, which I think we face with every new smart phone these days. I think, it would be sorted with future system updates. Overall, it is an incredible product from OnePlus and certainly the best one ever offered by them. I am sure it won‚Äôt disappoint you and it would be worth every penny you are going to spend for this phone.\n\n", '\n\n  Awesome cell phone must buy, best in Android, best in a market right now, best from all cell phones, value for money.\n\n', "\n\n  It's a beauty & the beast...

Superfast.. amazing look... Best design.. super cool features..Its 90 hz display is love.. i was confused between one plus 8 and one plus 7pro.. but I am very happy that i made the right decision to buy one plus 7 pro.  Its is also depend on your taste.. i wanted the curve display.. minimum 256 gb storage and HD+ screen... Wsap charging.. good brand value and that too below 45000..That is what, one plus 7 pro all about...\n\n', "\n\n  I ordered as soon as was available. The phone looks beautiful, feels premium. The letdown begins when u start using it for a while. The fingerprint reader was easy enough to setup. But upon usage had issues. it didn't work all the time. Lots of time the phone would just keep saying too many attempts & keep asking for pin. The pop up camera started having weird rubbing noise Everytime it was used.the phone calls had weird static distortion in them while they were quite clear on my iphone. I think they will release an update to fix it. The edges of the screen with the curve e resistance to touch and since the corners of the screen r more rounded than others, lots of time functionality was cut off. Like the voice message button in WhatsApp. The screen looked great with the 90hz display but unresponsiveness killed all the fun. It dosent matter if the screen is good . It might have a higher refresh rate but will still feel slow if the responsiveness is low. The camera quality was the most dissapointing aspect. Coming from iPhone the difference was quite apparent. The images seemed more granier and more saturated. The 3x zoom is underwhelming. Will probably install the pixel camera software as the stock software just dosent match up. But then the pixel phones have the best camera processing in the smartphone world.The battery is fine not great, but that was to be expected with the quad hd 90hz display. Roughly lasts 8to 9 hrs on average usage for me. Warp charge is a boon.Overall the price increase for the pro version does not seem to be justified. Too many trade-off. The one plus 7 which is not getting as much attention is a much better phone and more value for money. The difference in value proposition seems negilible between the two.\n\n", "\n\n  Screen : It's really awesome.. 90Hz is silky smooth..Charging Speed : It does charge 50% inside 20 mins..Battery Life : 1.5 - 2 Days battery life for my usage..

They are loud but not clear(Maybe it can be improved by changing the some setting or solve it in the next updates)My review : Overall i loved the phone.. If you are a normal usage phone person, then you will definitely love the phone b'coz of its 90Hz screen.. Some user will change the display setting to 60Hz, but if you start using it on 90Hz then there no way you will go back to 60Hz..Pros : As per my usage..#1 - If you use it for 30 mins and then take some another phone, you will not like the other phone.. You will fall in love with the display and once you start using it daily, you will not touch any other phone..#2 - Phone has a 1440 x 3120 pixels resolution and huge screen size, so if you watch a lot of content on your phone, You will love it..#3 - Performance is really fast..#4 - Definitely whole day battery life.. (1.5 day for me)Cons : As per my usage..#1 - As the screen size is huge, it is very difficult to use the phone in one hand.. You cannot type while chatting with one hand..#2 - Finger print sensor - I keep my phone inside my bag while driving, the screen wakes up so many times.. Accidental screens wakes up a lot..(Hope they solve this issue in next updates)#3 - Sometimes some apps do crash..

This phone justifies the price of 40K. It beats the Samsung and iPhone hands down in Display and aesthetics. Camera is tad bit inferior to Iphone Pro Max and Note 10 but the difference is marginal. Normal user will find it hard to notice the difference. Night Mode has been great with the latest software on.And yes, the User experience is better than Iphone. It took all these years for and Android phone to trump Apple in that regard. 90Hz refresh rate is not a gimmick, it makes every other mobile phone 'feel' slow.Battery life is great, lasts a full day with moderate to heavy usage , even with that 4k (90Hz)  screen on. Lord knows how much it will last if it is turned down to 60hz FHD.Software is on par with iOS as far as usability and touch/feel is concerned.

Fingerprint reader is so fast but it can not detect your finger if finger is not properly on the sensor.camera quality is superb,you can zoom in and out using ultra wide camera and battery life is good but i expect charging speed much more faster because it is warp charger. It will take 1 hours and 30 minutes for complete charge. Besides that one con is also here which is 3.5 mm audio jack. People who use wired earphone need to buy addition connecter which is 3.5 mm to type c converter.\n\n', '\n\n  I got the device on 17th may and already i can see dust in my rear camera lens .They have taken my device and told will replace it in a week ,online it shows they carrying repair work .Its really not good product .\n\n', "\n\n  It's been just 4days I have buyed this mobile via Amazon & it's having some problems like device getting restarted by its own sometimes takes mobile to boot menu applications doesn't work properly I need an urgent replacement of device\n\n", '\n\n  I was so thrilled when i order and got this in hand. But after 2 weeks of full fledged use, this is my verdict. Overall usage of phone is good. Its smooth in operation, fast in processing. But i did not get the feel of the Pricetag it had..Camera: After using the Samsung Note series for almost  6 years, i was very dissapointed in the Camera.. Though they claim a higher PPi, the clarity of the photos are that pathetic for a long distance shoot as compared to a lower version of a Galaxy phone..Battery is not that great but better than Samsung. But still need to see how long that goes. maybe i will have to review again after 3-5 months of use on the battery part..As a brand i feel that Oneplus is too confident now that they have acquired a steady market now and they feel that now they can start cheating the customers.. For this hefty price - there is not even a headphone, the 6+T atleast came with a supporting cable for the Aux, 7+pro didnt even have that.. I still wonder whats the reason for this price tag..I Should have gone for the Iphone XR..This is my biggest mistake i have ever done in purchasing a phone over the years..  NOT WORT THE PRICETAG\n\n', "\n\n  Everything is good as expected. Upgraded from my 5T.The display and the haptics just blew my mind.Battery is also good.

Battery dries out very fast. If you are typing in anything in a app. Suddenly the app closes automatically. Finger readers sometimes need 2 to 3 touches to work. Camera is excellent as expected. Much more was expected as this was a pro model. But every avarage performance. Fixes should be provided to overcome issues.\n\n', '\n\n  I cant tell you how amazing this phone is! I have been using this phone since one month.I would just say, go for this phone and you will never regret buying this!My mind was flipping between k20 pro and oneplus 7 pro, review in various websites says that both the phones are almost same in every aspect except the range,my sister bought k20 and i got a chance to test the camera on both the phones with my own naked eyes, and what i found is the quality of pictures on oneplus 7 pro is something i have never ever seen on any smartphone, not even iphones.Apart from the amazing camera, there are alot other features that i wished to be present in my phone. The gestures work perfectly, touch works as smooth as butter.No phone heating even while playing games in highest quality graphics. Yes, it heats little bit when you play and charge ur phone at the same time, but that is acceptable as it does not happen in every scenario and little bit is fine considering the processor.If you have proper knowledge of how to capture a photo by setting uo the focus and other stuffs, trust me you will end up taking a photo just like a dslr camera.Haptic feedback is another amazing feature on this phone, it really takes the gaming to another level, it vibrates when there is a beat/bass in the sound effect, wow so amazing man!Dolby speakers is another legendary feature that will blow your mind! Two speakers are always better than one!The flexibility to change the screen resolution just like in pcs is another feature. If you are worried that 90hz refresh rate would consume more battery, oneplus proved it wrong! I have not noticed any unnecessary battery consumption by the screen! The android version 10 has given this phone amazing utilization of resources, intellegent analysis by android tells me if any website or app is consuming battery higher than expected, this is a much needed feature on a smartphone with tons of apps loaded in it just like mine.To be really very frank, i have used this phone vigorously since i bought it just to check the benchmark of this phone and has not yet disappointed me. The only cool stuff from oneplus i miss on this phone is the notification led, coz there is no hardware support for it, although oneplus has tried to use the screen as the notification led, but it needs improvement and development and i am expecting oneplus team to arrange something cooler for the led.I am fully satisfied with this phone and i am hoping oneplus would not discontinue this product or pushing the android upgrades else it would be a huge disappointment.Great job Oneplus team!\n\n', '\n\n  Android Setup keeps stopping. Error occurring everytime I try to start. It is highly disappointing to you know order the phone, wait for it to get it delivered and end up having it not even starting. All the hype that is created by marketing about One Plus seems to be absolutely fake. Very bad indeed.\n\n', "\n\n  I am using this device from last 2 months and it's seems good time to right my personal opinion about this device.Display is osm no doubt about it, and phone feel very premium in hand, but it's very slippery so impossible to use without Case.Battery charging speed is osm but battery backup is not that impressive. I am a normal user just check my email and business messages and youtube nothing else.I bought this device around 44k and now price drop to 39999 in 2 months.THE BIGGEST ISSUE WHICH I AM FACING WITH THIS DEVIVE IS THAT IT SUDNELY STOP WORKING AND THEN WORK FINE AFTER 2 OR 3 MINUTE LATER.

Having speaker issue in less that 7 days..upset..\n\n', '\n\n  This product is a beast....with all the features and the 6.7" screen with the 90hz makes it a perfect match for movies and video.....with the latest snapdragon 855 the phn is lighting fast......But not having a earphone or at least a type C to 3.5mm converter in the package was a bit of disappointment.Though the phn is not officially certified waterproof but from my previous one plus experience I could tell u it\'s not much of an issue....the device is water resistant to a good extentLastly the camera .....the portrait mode is legit....it has an amazing field of view.....the primary lenses also does a pretty decent job.....but the ultrawide lens is not up to the mark.....the dynamic range is not good and the photo also looks a bit noisy.....so some research is required on that part...The front facing selfie camera also does a good job....my best SELFIE CAMERA by farOverall if u ask me it\'s a pretty decent device to go with your daily activities and gaming; editing and other stuff like thatU won\'t regret buying this..üòÑüòÑ\n\n', '\n\n  Finger print is very goodCamera good qualityBattery backup good\n\n', "\n\n  It has an amazing display and it's buttery smooth with the 90hz refresh rate! The camera is a beast tho. Battery is decent. 6hrs sot once fully charged. And while gaming I get around 3-3.5hrs sot in fanatic mode while playing pubg! But people who are looking for more performance and better battery backup and smoothness, I would recommend them to go with Asus Rog Phone 2. By the way this review is from a long time OnePlus user and also Rog user! Peace. Have a good day! :)\n\n", "\n\n  This is hands down the fastest phone out right now and will be for the rest of 2019 and 2020 until Oneplus 8 comes out. Oneplus tinkers with Android OS to prioritise on speed. This phone would easily last someone 3+ years. The screen is absolutely stunning and the 90hz motion on the screen makes it one of the best screens out. Camera is also brilliant and takes amazing pictures. It's got wide angle lens which I absolutely love. Similar to go pro. It's also got standard lens which takes great photos on day and at night too. And a zoom lens. Battery life is also very good and would easily last a day. I never have to worry about storage since it has enough to store for over 2 years for me. Google photos backs up unlimited photos and videos for free so I don't have to always keep photos in my device. So 256gb storage is an overkill and I love it. The price of this phone is a few hundred pound cheaper than others and is better to me! You would absolutely love the warp charger. It will charge your phone to around 50% in 20 minutes. It is a lot faster than Samsungs fast charge. The best part is that it will still charge fast even if you're using the phone where as other chargers will slow it down a lot. I have zero regrets from getting this phone! Thank you Oneplus for making an amazing phone.\n\n", '\n\n  I don‚Äôt how they are charging so premium without quality,1+6t camera was so good so I thought of going for 1+7 pro but it‚Äôs not at all worth it I was using VIVO V15pro camera was much better simply I ve sold it for this worst phone\n\n', "\n\n  Pros:Kickass DisplayRegular Updates/patchesCons:Average camera. What's the point of having a triple camera if apart from the main cam, the other two are below par.Battery life is very average given the size and price. Getting a screen on time of 4-6 hrs.Too heavy and bulky.My indian sim card had no signal in Europe for the whole trip while my wife's OnePlus 5 with indian sim was able to latch on to networks in europe. Both of us use Jio.In display Finger scanner is a pain in the assFor the price I expected a better phone.\n\n", "\n\n  I am using one plus 7 pro since the day it was launched in India. I am using the Mirror Grey version.I was waiting to complete at least 2 months before I post a review here.It is worth the money. So many people told me that the phone is looking great and asked me which brand it is.You will never go back to 60Hz refresh rate phones once you start using this 90Hz version.I admit that the phone is a bit heavier than the one which I was using before (Xperia Z5 premium), however, it doesn't matter.4 K videos are just awesome, the camera quality is very nice.The Dolby Atmos feature and the dual speaker combo is my favorite.All these are the Pros of PRO.Now, I have the habit of finding the wrong things when I find something too good :D-  No headphones jack, they don't provide the C-type headphones connector-  One plus wireless bullet earphones are always out of stock- Little heavier- Not that pocket-friendly\n\n", '\n\n  It is a complete package the only flaw is the 3.5mm jack but u should also consider the power this product packs so not getting a jack is understandable.

I just love it.\n\n', '\n\n  The One Plus 7 Pro exceeds expectations. Excellent seamless transitioning between apps and very good camera. Definitely worth it !\n\n', "\n\n  bang for buck... the hardware, the craftsmanship.. what a marvel this machine is...high speed surf-boarding is what comes to my mind every time I operate it...runs like the wind... this is truly the 'master of all'... the cosmetic appeal, the functionality and the bumper cameras are drool worthy...All of it, packaged into a mirror grey body that u would yearn to hold in ur hand and grin at. üòÅ\n\n", "\n\n  Presenting the best phone is the budget presented the 90hz is a visual delight, no doubt the in screen fingerprint reader is a bit slower than the conventional methods, camera add an extra dimension to the photography it's not just good it's really good. Nightsight could be a bit better but still it has come leaps and bounds since the 'dark ages' the battery life leaves more to be desired for but warp charge is the best thing to be adapted with in half an hour i can go from nay to gaming without thinking will the charge last or not.... It's just the best...\n\n", "\n\n  It is worth it. Camera was not upto the mark before update, but it has improved a lot recently. And future updates will definitely make it a great shooter.Other than that you'll love 90hz display, Fast, clean and uncluttered UI, and overall premium feel.Only issue is it is hard to find good cheap tempered glass atm and there is no official tempered glass from oneplus available yet.Overall, it is worth the money.\n\n", '\n\n  Awesome phone. To start with pros, amazing design and the color nebula blue is nice. Camera quality is good for the price, never settle with the speed.

I saw few reviews, people comparing camera with low end phones. The difference is the new AI feature with mid range phone which is just a software upgrade. AI camera images looks great but are automatically editing when clicked. This is the reason people feel some mid ranged phone phones camera are good but actually that's not. That's just a software they use.Taking that into consideration each and every thing is worth.\n\n", '\n\n  Overall experience of this phone is amazing, that display and the speed of this phone with that processor, refresh rate and Oxygen-OS work so well together, this phone is butter. Well worth the price tag, yes its expensive but it is not overpriced. Also got one year manufacturers warranty and 6 months of screen replacement protection plan. Lack of headphone jack and even the dongle is unfortunate, but I can look past it since I really love this device.\n\n', "\n\n  My sister bought this phone. As expected this is an amazing phone and has every feature one could expect. Battery life is almost a day (sometimes even more). Camera clarity is amazing. One thing I didn't like about this series is that OnePlus hasn't released tempered glass for it yet and every other tempered glass is just not good enough. After 6 months or so the camera clarity is very poor.\n\n", "\n\n  Don't waste your money buying this...

Initially looked like a part of the bezel , but then I realised that the pixels were not working in the area . The black bezel like spot also has a voilet hallo around it .

The video is as smooth as butter and you can somehow tell the difference between when it's running at 60Hz refresh rate and 90 Hz refresh rate. The 90 Hz refresh rate just feels much much cleaner and more absorbing. It is actually hypnotizing that's how good this phone is. You can use it for gaming and the visuals will be mind altering altogether. I was just playing Modern Combat 5 and wow what a mind bending experience it is. You can actually place yourself in the thick of battle with the chaos all around you. I have also played other games like temple runner etc. and they run like butter.

After paying 53k this was not expected from One Plus Family. Disappointed.\n\n', "\n\n  I am writting this review after extensively using this phone for more than two weeks. Let's divide it in pros and cons.Pros-1- One of the best feature of this phone is it's Display.  It's Quad HD display is one of the best in the market and at par with the likes of S10, iPhone series.2- The curved display gives a brilliant overall premium look and practicality to this phone. The curve is so subtle that it kind of flows in the phone and gives you a better grip.3-  90hz refresh rate is like you slipping I'm butter. It's is so smooth that you will feel odd using other mobiles. You can feel the difference as soon as you pick this phone.4- After the camera update all bugs are gone now and the picture quality you are getting at this price is brilliant and on par with likes of Samsung and iPhone. You just have to change the camera settings to get the best out of it. There are 1000 plus videos to guide you through it.5- Stereo Speaker, A person who has used One plus before will understand what a drastic improvement one plus has done on sound quality. It's is loud, it's is crisp and any audiophile will like it.6- Call quality. Cellular call quality and reception is good with this phone. There is no lag or anything with this device.7- Built quality- The phone is premium looking, well built beast. No flaws or air gaps you can find and it gives you an confidence when you hold it in your hands.Cons-1-  First I have to right this. There are so many reviews for this phone giving 1 star and stating that they have seen on YouTube that it comes with a headphone and they didn't receive it. I mean this  is heights of stupidity guys. Firstly, in description only it is clearly mentioned what all comes with the phone and secondly youtubers get a review unit which is totally different from a retail unit. One cannot judge a phone on this particular thing.2- Battery- So you have a big battery here and with a moderate to heavy media use it will last you to 12-14 hours.This includes 2-3 hours callingSocial media consumptionStreaming sites consumption ( as World Cup in going on and we want India to win)So, battery will give you above average use but it is definitely not bad. Morey, one can change the 90hz refresh rate setting to 60hz and Qhd to Hd setting if you want more battery life, but again what's the fun here.3- 3.5 mm headphone jack- So I was one of guys who was really disappointed with this move of removing 3.5 mm jack. But, after getting this phone I got good Bluetooth headphone and I understood that what I was missing. Sound quality wise the opinion is divided among people as some say you get better sound quality over Bluetooth and some say it is better with 3.5 mm headphone jack. But, the kind of freedom you get with wireless device is way way better. And after you get a wireless earbuds or headphone you will understand that it is way better than wired ones. So, personally this is not a con for me now.4- weight- Phone is definitely heavy when you compare to other phones. But, you will get use to it. And after some time you will feel more confident with the weight of this phone while handling. It is not an issue.Conclusion- So one plus was a brand which use to kill the flagships of the year and now it has created a flagship of its own. We should understand this that usually a flagship phone which we get from Samsung or Apple at 70-80k, here we are getting it for 50k. This phone gives you all the premium features at a lesser price than its competitors.So, if you have a budget of around 50k. You should go for this phone without even thinking twice definitely it's flagship of the year with the price point it comes. Just go for it guys!!!!!!\n\n", "\n\n  Lets not start a paragraph & jumping into pros & cons :PRO'S ;Screen : The screen is really impressive & the slight curved edges are adding an awesome impression every time you look at the display .Speed : It has 0 lag . Currently I am using op7 pro 8Gb variant & it runs without any lag till now .Have played games like pubg & asphalt but it runs smooth & fast without any issues .Also no major heating issues has been observed even after running pubg for more than 2 hours .Camera : Its a next generation camera which I have not experienced before . The low light images are mind blowing & can compare with any DSLR . The AI camera quickly adopts to any scene automatically & switches its mode . Landscape photography even at night seems pretty awesome .The front camera is pretty much realistic & will give a genuine image without much beauty or skin smoothing effect . (Those can be added externally if you wish) .Fingerprint / Face unlock : Works more than fine .Battery : Really awesome . gives around 6 hours of Screen on time with constant FB / Messenger / insta / you tube stream / 2 hrs of pubg on high graphics . Without gaming you can have 8 hours of S.O.T without any doubtAdd on : It has horizon lightning instead of notification LED . Every time you receive a notification the edge will glow up . It looks quite premium & stylish .Delivery & packing : Within a single day without any issue .CON'S :The phone is quite heavy compared to my previous one plus 5 . It really pains the fist if you grab it single handed for long time as its 208 gm . (Still you can manage it I believe as its not a thor's hammer ).No notification LED . Instead of that ambient display & horizon lightning is there but still i prefer the edge old notification LED .No 3.5 mm jack . You can buy a type c to 3.5 mm converter spending 250 rs more from Amazon  .No more cons . Overall its a performance phone with a premium look , holding it you can stand out of the crowd & can make yourself an attraction point :)\n\n", '\n\n  This is my first one plus phone..I bought this phone for display,speed,storage.. I am satisfied with all these three things..added advantage is a camera..over all the infinite display is awesome,speed is super and storage is 256gb..Love this phone..Battery charging is faster..it has warp charging feature..once charged can use for a day..I will give 3.7/5 for  battery..\n\n', "\n\n  Well, One plus has outdone itself this time.Each aspect of the phone, Camera, Battery life, Screen resolution, Touch, Fingerprint reader, Speed, Oxygen OS, Sound and the over all user experience has been made so awesome and perfect that I don't crave for more. You buy this, you'll forget everything else. There are over priced phones out there in the market but they won't come close to this beast. I am 110% satisfied and hope One plus keeps making awesome stuff in the future\n\n", "\n\n  Nothing better if your budget is around 50k. The display and design is just gorgeous. Oneplus is a brand which can be trusted.  For the 2 months that I have had this pjone i have received like so many software updates. That says a lot about OnePlus's dedication.

Decent battery life which can last a day for normal usage. Charging speed is really excellent.Display is one of the best but not "the best". Color accuracy is not on par with s10 plus but close to it. Though i would prefer oneplus 7 pro\'s display since it has no notch and 90hz refresh rate.Sound quality and haptic feedback is greatly improved compared to it\'s predecessor and on par with the flagship devices.Overall its an ultimate performer with best display and sound.\n\n', "\n\n  I am using this phone from last  2.5 months.Likes:Oxygen OS from Oneplus is big plus for this phone. It is very stable varient of android available in the market.Fingerprint Scanner is very fast.Camera quality is decent.Battery life is also good that it last about a day with average screen on time of about 7 hours.Thanks to 30W charger which comes with it in the box.Phone is performing very good. I have used this phone for 800 hrs up time. But found nothing serious.Dislikes:Brand: OnePlus is giving awesome phone each time but within 6 months it comes with OnePlus 7T with better performance and features than OnePlus 7 Pro at lower price. They are not maintaining the value of their flagships. I have spent 58k for this phone and now I feels like I have paid for wrong device.I advice all to go for Samsung or Apple iPhones because they are maintaining value of their flagships for at least a year.Camera: It will miss some frames when recording in slow motion. Also there are many flaws in camera system which may be resolved with software updates.At last I will say that Amazon service was very poor. When I ordered this phone from Amazon, It was reached at Amazon's local facility whithin two days. But As I am a non prime member, they took 2 more days for delivery. They were able to deliver the phone within 2 days but they didn't.\n\n", "\n\n  Waited a long for it.. Been in love with the OP every since I got the OP 2..

My previous mobile LG G4 has excellent camera quality even though it is a 16 megapixels and 3 years old.How OnePlus can fix such a worst camera in their flagship mobile which are over priced at above 49k and they say it's best camera.Its 48 megapixels camera not able to focus anything and the final image is blurry.Oneplus should fix this issue.\n\n", "\n\n  I buy this phone for it's curved & full view display but there is other department also which should be considered.‚Ä¢Okay,battery life is average,not long lasting as mi or realme 3 smartphone (reason is 6.67 inch large & amoled display).‚Ä¢Run high graphic games smoothly with some heating but getting heated if you play pubg at ultra hd & extreme frame rates.‚Ä¢well camera pictures quality is average,not like in youtube videos sample but this should be okey because other than youtuber videos sample there is not so much difference b/wsamsung,oneplus,oppo,apple camera,But 4k video & normal video recording is very good.‚Ä¢Important thing is it's oxygen os - it is good but not a hyped which many youtuber spread & there is no inovation in it.‚Ä¢Other cons is its lacking(absence) of inbult app locker because you can apply a password with screen lock but also use same password to lock your app which is not good for privacy point of view..So, this is my conclusion after using this for around one month._________________________________For display 5/5Back camera 4/5Front camera 3/5Gaming 5/5Sound 5/5Fingerprint reader 4/5\n\n", "\n\n  Undoubtedly this beauty deserves 5 stars without any doubt..!

But it sincerely lags in Camera department even after updates. Video Recording, Voice Recording are great but i am not sure for some reason pics from its front camera just looks average and lacks true colors. Infact, my previous phone Redmi Note5 Pro used to click better selfies. Battery drains quickly if you use 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. Luckily, it has a warp charging adapter with it. Although, the phones gives you premium feel at a premium price but One Plus should look into the Camera Software updates. It's no where near to that of Pixel, Note series or Huwaei premium phones in terms of camera. Except for camera, this phone is a rockstar.\n\n", "\n\n  It's extraordinary, only thing which is lagging when compared to Apple and pixel phones is camera. Nonetheless camera are also really good.

I opted for the 256 GB + 8 GB RAM option. With an uncommon screen refresh rate of 90 Hz ,scrolling through applications and switching between them is fast and buttery smooth. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is very fast and rarely misses on the first try. The edge to edge screen is huge and very emersive; being a class leading Samsung AMOLED screen colors are rich and vibrant. Using the pop-up selfie camera is both clever and fast. The camera quickly emerges from it's cubby hole and quickly returns. The phone can instantly detect when it's in free fall and will quickly and automatically retract the camera to avoid damage. A lot of reviewers lamented this phone's lack of official water resistance rating. The phone is definitely water proof. I have had it exposed to pouring rain and placed it on wet surfaces without any issues.\n\n", "\n\n  Writing this review after 1.5 monthSo guys the 90hz screen the best part you will definitely call in love with it from the day one it's buttery smooth with sd 855 man it's a beast playing HD games feels great on this phone.Charging is also fast ever morning I plug my device and I get my device all juiced up before leaving office in about an hour.Although it has no 3.5 mm headphone jack but you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy the c type bullets available at OnePlus website (they are awesome) or but the connector available at OnePlus website, so stop making a fuss about 3.5 mm jack (u are spending around 50k here, go buy a decent headphone too).Camera after the updates improved a lot and now pictures are quite good, still there are some issues with lowlight photos but in proper light the photos are good. Front camera selfie is also good no issues with that.Overall a nice phone, a bit overpriced (after looking at the price of k20 pro üòõ) but yes it's still the flagship killer and way better than many of it's competitors.\n\n", '\n\n  I am using this device for around a week. These are the things I came across:1.) Display is very big. It is okay for me but single hand operation will be difficult if you havent got big enough hands.2.) This device is heavy.

RAM management is excellent .. didnt come across any lag issues or frame drops while playing.6.) Charges really fact and have a good enough screen on time(for me).There are minor issues which i believe they will fix with upcoming updates and YES they either should have provided a headphone jack or some connector for my wired headphones. This is expected as u are pricing something around 50k and also not proving wireless charging and waterproof certifications......this is kinda upsetting.But yes it is a good device.

All things look much beautiful in one plus 7 Pro becz of such good display.I think one plus should have provided headphone jack connectors, as there is slot for it and we are able to use one plus 6t's connector, so there's no use of not providing the connector, or else they should provide free Bluetooth earphones.\n\n", '\n\n  I bought OnePlus 7 Pro(6GB, Mirror Gray)  from Amazon on 4 October 2019 in \'Amazon Great Indian Sale.Seller Name - Rocket Kommerce LLPOn 9 Oct, my Phone delivered and I was doing the initial setup.Suddenly an error occurred that showing "Android Setup Keeps Stopping" and Nothing happens.

Seamless experience with a superb camera. Helped me a lot on my trip to the US. Check out a few shots.\n\n", '\n\n  Camera quality is very poor. Being a premium phone, the One Plus brand did not pay much attention on primary camera. The primary camera comes with 16MP, but the resolution is not as expected. The selfies taken by MI is far better then the one captured by this phone. The One Plus brand should take this feedback very seriously and try to fix it up by providing some updated camera software updates.Very much disappointed as far as camera is concerned.The package lacks the Type C USB to audio jack converter. The One Plus should take up this feedback and include the one in the pack.As far as battery back up is concerned, it is very good.

The portrait mode could also be a bit improved.The battery is not terrible, but should carry around the charger if travelling for a day.The phone is pretty huge and heavy, but don't know if that's much of a big deal.Overall a futuristic smartphone with pretty descent value for money. I definitely bought this device over the regular one plus 7 for the screen and it's obviously worth it. Add a warp charge that can give a full charge in about an hour, a very satisfying haptic feedback, a definite head turner popup cam, triple cam setup and it's very much a value for money flagship !!\n\n", "\n\n  I have got 2 OnePlus 7 Pro in my family right now.One in Mirror Black and another in Nebula Blue (Both are 8gb/256gb models). As far as looks are concerned, both the colors look fabulous. Nebula Blue looks strikingly beautiful.Specs sheet can be obtained from the description box, so I ain't gonna discuss about it. Review will be purely based on the user experience.Things I like:1) Looks- I'm gonna say it again and again, this phone looks stunning. As soon as you take this phone in your hand, you will feel that you didn't dump your money in garbage. This sure looks and feels premium.2) Software- Oxygen OS works like a charm on this phone. No lags, nothing. It's super clean and useful and highly customisable. You'll get regular updates (august security patch was delivered to this phone even before pixel phones which is mind blowing) with a promise of 3 years of future updates.3) Camera- I'm currently on the Oxygen OS version 9.5.11 and believe me when I say, the camera is not a regular Joe. It performs well in all lighting conditions. All the three lenses are very useful in taking different kind of shots. Nightscape is fantastic. The camera app has been given several tweaks with regular OTA updates and it's always getting better.4) Hardware and build quality- Phone has excellent hardware. Throw any app/games on it and it will run as smooth as butter. RAM management is also very good. Battery runs through an entire day and I have noticed some improvement in battery life after the last update. On an average, I'm getting around 5.5-6.5 hrs of screen on time, which is decent. The phone surface is quite slippery, I was keeping it without back cover, but the sixth drop made me realise that I should put the cover back on. The phone is still not damaged but there are some minor scratches around the corners.Overall- Build quality is superb.I would highly recommend this phone to someone who wants a high performance phone with quality hardware.\n\n", '\n\n  Though I liked the phone very much, I was shocked to note that there was no User Manual. I checked online too but not available online too. When I contacted Oneplus for the same, I was informed that manual must be inside the box or I should contact Amazon from where I bought the phone. Unfortunately I can not find a way to contact Amazon and as a result, I am not in a position to use my Phone fully.\n\n', '\n\n  I just brought it 15days ago and one plus 7T got released with same features and 20000 less price and it has fallen from just 35cm and screen got broken.\n\n', "\n\n  Will keep it concise & helpful:Oneplus has successfully manufactured a device, very capable in almost every aspect; here are the pros and cons though:Pros:1. Sturdy & beautiful built2. Immersive screen(even at 60Hz its beautiful, 90Hz just takes it to the next level)3. Loud sound & crisp, clear voice( in voice calls)4. Blazing fast...Never hangs or freezes...5. Camera hardware is top notch!6. Perfect weight distribution, feels so great to even hold it.Cons:Battery's just an average performerFingerprint reader takes a few days/weeks to calibrate.Camera software should be tweaked and improved, hardware has a lot of potential\n\n", '\n\n  Excellent phone.\n\n', "\n\n  I waited patiently for a month to buy the Almond edition and by god it was worth it. The beauty of this variant is very difficult to capture in photos, it really needs to be felt first hand.Coming on to the device itself, it is a monster, in every way. The battery is pretty good, fingerprint sensor works most of the time, vibration motor is amazing, 90 hz is the Trump card. Everything about this phone is spectacular except:The fact that OnePlus have decided to skip the headphone adapter in the box. I covered myself in this regard by buying it before the phone itself but it has been out of stock ever since. There is no reason to omit it from the box.OnePlus has said that it is splash proof, but an official IP rating would have been nice.I don't use wireless charging but for a phone that costs 50k, it should have been there. But I understand OnePlus' point of view that it is better to do it properly.Wide angle video missing, coming as a future update, portrait mode uses telephoto lens.Overall the best phone you can lay hands on.\n\n", "\n\n  I would be more than happy if someone help me to report all issues i am facing with device to one plus 7 pro authority.I think the device i am using is not up to the mark as it's performance is very poor as compared to OnePlus6,  OnePlus6t, OnePlus7 and other OnePlus7Pro,  may be it's defected piece.Everytime while using almost every application like FB,  Netflix or any other the device is getting freeze and personally i don't think so that is common for oneplus device when you have 256GB ROM and 8GB RAM out of which 100GB is available to use.My friends who are using OnePlus6,  6t or OnePlus7 giving them better performance as compared to my device i. e.

Some other apps got stuck at 90 percent.But, most of the apps got installed fine. I reinstalled the OS to see if the problem gets solved, but no!2. 90 hz display looks good most of the time (70 percent of the time). Other 30 percent of the time, it lags a lot. I don't think I even got 10 hz at those times. It mostly lagged while scrolling apps, browsing internet, e.t.c3. Screen doesn't go off to sleep after 30 sec. Of inactivity, as specified in settings,. We have to force it most of the times by clicking power button.4. Haptic feedback doesn't work more than half the time. Some times it works for 10 mins or so, and stops working for the next 2 - 3 hours.After some many times of updating and reinstalling OS and apps ***PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS***\n\n", "\n\n  I have been thinking lot about choosing this one or 7t but I needed display of OnePlus 7 pro so went with it and never had a thought of getting op 7t pro as it is way pricey and not much difference between this one and so1. Display is fantastic one of the best display I have seen ever2. Camera is not that great but it gets job done3. Battery is also on lower side as it's 90hz display consumes lot but as its charges quickly there won't be problem4. As per my usage I would say oxygen os is better than stock in many ways as it have lot and lot of customization5. It's a very minor thing - Haptic motor OMG it's just amazing you'll feel when you use it ..it's really super cool to experience while typing or navigating through gestures or receiving phone calls\n\n", "\n\n  For those complaining  about display and camera issue. Trust this review.I've been an avid user of Samsung from the last 5 years and I've had all of their flagships. This was my first time with One Plus and I am surprised that it surprises me in all departments.. That flamboyant display with a cheeky 90hz is something ppl say is not noticable...Trsut me the absolute feel of that is beautiful.Gaming is undeniably the best from the best in this segment.Camera is great with the patches all of its issues are fixed and going forward many more patch updates will hopefully just make it better.. Stabilization is on point. The audio captured on the videos is great quality.Speed is absolutely is blazing fast... Yes it is going to face a challenge from the likes of redmi k20 pro. But it is a one plus end of the day and am 100% sure display is where k20 pro is not going to win. Also software optimization and camera is better any day on the op7 pro...Lastly, it is not about the best phone.

Though the nightscape mode and portrait mode of this phone is just great but normal camera does just a decent job. I was a big fan of OnePlus and was using OnePlus 3 before purchasing this and other than a little hardware update there is nothing much to this device. Also, its not worth the money (58k) just because of no IP rating and poor camera performance.After using for about 3 months I can rate:-Battery performance:- 4.5/5Camera:- 3/5Software:- 5/5Display:- 5/5Value for money:- 3.8/5.\n\n', '\n\n  The worst experience I ever had  since I started using mobile.

I can say Samsung s10+ and s10 are real beast in camera don't forget Huawei p30 pro.Fingerprint sensor is super fast but sometimes some apps Don't show up sensor to unlock.If you are looking for camera centric smartphone go for iPhone XR or Samsung s10 series.Oneplus 7pro is best in performance\n\n", '\n\n  Once I started using one plus, I have been hooked, good value for money , this is my second exchange through Amazon portal, product meets the expectations in terms of build quality, ease of using, friendly interface,  quick charging, sufficient battery life, commendable sound and image quality.\n\n', "\n\n  Whenever you put call on speaker mode and talk, the receiver is doesn't listen to our voice, the voice breaks and this is a blunder technical issue, which even one plus are not able to resolve from my phone.\n\n", '\n\n  Loving this phone..

The best display i have seen on a smartphone. And the other two things which i loved about this phone is the haptic motor and the Warp charge.Overall this phone ia worth every penny you spend.My friend bought Samsung Galaxy S10 plus and we tested out which fone is better, and there was doubt that OnePlus 7 pro is the clear winner.Thank you OnePlus for such an amazing product.Proud to be a part of OnePlus family.\n\n', "\n\n  It's a true Ultra Premium DeviceüíØüî•Amazon delivery - 5/5Phone build quality - 5/5Battery backup -5/5Camera after (9.5.8 update ) is much better than earlier - 4/5Display - 5/5Speaker - 5/5Heating - 3.5/5Warp charge - 5/5Its a superb device if you searching for a premium phone .. go for it without any doubt.I upgraded my OnePlus 5t to OnePlus 7pro .. & I can say it is the best over all other phones in market with heavy price like (apple , Samsung) instead of those heavy price trash you can choose this low price true phoneüíØ\n\n", '\n\n  A must buy , I was initially not able to make up mind for this beauty but trust me the phone is a masterpiece.Mine model is 6/128 MG , No lags , no bloatware, no ads (mi,realms,vivo,oppo),immersive display view on full screen.The gaming is super smooth and fluid ,no matter what game you play.Camera zoom and picture quality is awesome.Viewing movies on QHD gives so immersive view on the full screen.Go for it , a bang for buck phone.\n\n', "\n\n  Fingerprint reader is not that great.

Camera could have been better but I'm overall satisfied with the camera because I believe it's not about the tools when it comes to photography.The infinite curved display with stereo speakers give the best viewing experience when it comes to watching movies / series on the phone.Simply, go for it.\n\n", '\n\n  Powerful delivery by Amazon one day prime dayThe phone is very beautiful design vise color is lovely sleek design Pop up Camera is very fastAll the specs were mind blowing\n\n', "\n\n  Well being a OnePlus user from the 5th Generation of their models, I would say they've come out to be one of the best players in the competition.Talking about the Display it's fantastic, you would love to use this device all the time when it is in your hand. I wouldn't say it's big, but rather it's immersive. And rhe refresh rate is just the icing on the cake.The battery life is also nice, much better than I thought as a day would be enough for a heavy user, and there's no need to worry as the Warp Charger is there to help you out.Now the main weakness on of this phone is the camera. Well it's not that bad but it's not what everyone would expect from a OnePlus device for the premium pricing, well it's kind of descent, much more similar to the previous generations, just the wide angle lens is the main centre of attraction.And at last the built quality and performance, hands down, unbeatable!\n\n", "\n\n  Let's get the cons out of the way. I noticed mainly 3 things that may concern buyers.1. Form Factor- The size and weight of this phone is too big. Even if I have bigger hands.its impossible to use in one hand. You will get used to the weight but when u pick up other devices u will feel OnePlus 7 pro could have better weight balamce. It may pain a little if u are lying down and watching any video for a long time.2. Battery life - on paper 4000 mAh battery looks good.but it's battery back up is average. I am getting little more than  4 Hrs screen on time. U can increase the battery by turning off 90 hz . Buts what's the point of turning it off while 90 hz is the reason u r buying this phone.3. No always on display- Coming from Samsung phones I really miss the always on display features. Thought it has ambient display but u can never see notification unless u touch the phone. Don't know why OnePlus did not give this feature. At least give a option to turn it on or off.Now let's talk about advantages of this phone.1. Display- oh boy.u can enjoy this beauty of display all day long. Quad Hd 90 HZ amodled display is stunning. Once u use 90 hz other phones will feel slow and that includes iPhone too.yeah u heard that right.2. Sofwtwere experience- oxygen Os is so close to stock Android and in some cases it it better. Buttery smooth animation and super quick Android updates makes it one of the few devices having Android 10 at the time I am writing this review3. Sound Quality- This phone does have a decent dual stereo speaker which gets very loud. Audio quality is great also has Dolby Atmos support.4. Haptic feedback - I did not think earlier vibration  motors are to be considered as an advantages. But this phones vibration feedback is precise and strong. U will feel joy typing on this phone for sure.5. I was sceptical about this phones camera because many reviewers said camera is the weakest point of this phone. But I found the main 48 mp sensor as good as S10, iPhone 11 level. Though it's secondary cameras lacks behind those flagships.  U can tweak the photos little bit and will get excellent result. One plus nighscapeobe is brilliant. Better than Samsung's night mode.6. Performance - Snapdragon 855 and adreno 640 is more than capable of heavy tasks and gaming and this phone is no exception. Never faced any lag. That's it.Verdict- The pros overweights the cons by very long margin. If u can manage the weight or size this phone will bring a smile on your face.

Samsung's display looks better cz of the color vividness and saturation. But this one is one of the best display. Processor? 855 sd no need to say more about it. Sound is supergood but still searching for earphones suitable with this device. Just disappointed with the camera. Wide angle is just useless as it has lower angle of view and when you zoom into clicked image its blurry. Same with normal pic. It looks good until you zoom. Pics clicked are not sharp they r soft and blurry. Even redmi phone 15k priced clicks sharper pics than this. 4k 60fps video is certainly something it saves this phone as clarity is really superb.

The phone is bundled in a premium box with a letter from the founder and invitation to join the OnePlus forums. This was a nice touch.Retail box: Box contains the device, warp charger, documentation, SIM eject tool and a clear silicone phone sleeve. Headphones and/or USB type c to 3.5 mm jack is missing. 4/5Design: I ordered the nebula blue version of the phone. The front of the phone is all display with minimal bezels. The curved front gives a premium appearance to the device. The back of the device has a frosted blue glass finish. The back is resistant to fingerprints while the front is a fingerprint magnet. The phone has stereo speakers with the earpiece above the display functioning as one of the loudspeakers. The bottom firing speaker is present on the bottom bezel of the screen. The loudspeakers are loud and produce pleasant sound.Display: the QHD 90Hz HDR AMOLED display is a gorgeous work of art. The display is buttery smooth and the experience of interaction with the curved screen is a joy. The embedded in display fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurate.Camera: the front popup camera is a fixed focus unit. It produces bright images with adequate amount of details. The front camera is good for video calls. The back 48 MP camera is good in bright light conditions. Produces noisy images in low light conditions. Using GCAM or nightscape mode helps render usable night shots. The wide angle camera is a nice addition but the rendition and the amount of resolved detail are inadequate. The telephoto camera helps create 3x lossless zoom. The resolved details are usable for social media but not good for prints.Performance: the phone is blazing fast. The 8 GB RAM is more than adequate for day to day usage. The on board storage is blazing fast. The OxygenOS is a great implementation of android that is fast and has many usable additions to stock android.Battery life: The battery lasts 2 days with my daily usage involving 1 hour of web browsing, 1 hour of streaming videos and about 1 hour of phonecalls. The bundled fast charger is great. It charges the battery to 80% in 30 minutes.\n\n', '\n\n  Amazing in every possible way. While everything is top notch quality, the screen is just mesmerising and completely notchless.

While charging mobile gets heated.5) Screen resolution is really good.6) After an upgrade to Android10, there are lot of bugs. Phone hubgs on most of the applications.\n\n", "\n\n  Firstly I would like to say that this mobile is currently one of the fastest android smartphones in the market. Now let's go to the PROS and CONS of this device. This is my review after using it for one week.PROS-1) Beautiful and elegant design with Gorilla Glass 5.2) Full-View Display with beautiful curved edges with 90Hz and 2K resolution with AMOLED Panel(on par with SAMSUNG).3) The Camera performance has improved tremendously after the Android 10 update. I would rate it to be as same as Samsung Galaxy S10 and way better than the iPhone 11(not Pro & Max). The main shooter is a 48MP camera(Sony IMX586) with an aperture of F1.6, a sensor size of 1/2'. The telephoto camera is an 8MP with an optical zoom of 3X and an aperture of F2.4. Both these cameras have OIS+EIS and can record videos in 4K 60fps. The ultra-wide camera is a 16MP shooter with a FOV of 116 degrees and an aperture of F2.2. The primary camera has great low-light performance and Night Mode is just awesome. The selfie camera is a pop-up module and I find it to be really attractive.4) Do I need to say anything about the performance? This one's a beast with the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6GB RAM and 128GB UFS 3.0 storage.5) You all have heard the name, right? Oxygen OS-the best version of stock Android that you can get. Snapdragon 855 and Oxygen OS- a marriage made in heaven. Blistering speeds, no lags or crashes till now(Make sure to perform a factory reset after upgrading from Android 9 to Android 10 otherwise you may encounter lags or crashes).6) WARP Charging- this is one of the most useful features of OnePlus. WARP Charge ensures that the 4000mAh battery goes from 0-50% in just 30 minutes. I generally don't let my mobile go beyond 25% charge and WARP charge ensures that I can top my device from 25%-100% in just around 1 hour.7) Stereo Speakers with DOLBY ATMOS- it gives depth to music and watching movies is a pleasure on this device.8) In-display Fingerprint Scanner- this is one of the fastest in-display fingerprint scanner out there. It unlocks the device in less than a second.Now coming to the CONS of this device-1) No Notification LED- there is no physical notification LED on this device. So in case of missed events, you have to wake the device to see them.2) Missing Software Features- Some software features are missing on this device. Always-ON-Display is not there. Come on OnePlus, you have a team of high skilled developers and since the device comes with an AMOLED panel, I find no reason to exclude this feature.3) The pre-applied screen protector is of no use. It has bubbles and will automatically come off after 5-6 hours of usage. A good tempered glass and a good protector case is recommended. The provided case doesn't live up to the expectations and I highly doubt if it will protect the mobile in case of an accidental drop.4) Phantom Touches- I know it's a software glitch but sometimes these phantom touches are really irritating. They have really decreased since the Android 10 update but occasionally I still get them. A software update should fix the issue.5) Lack of MACRO Photography- This one is really a bummer. For some odd reason, OnePlus did not include a MACRO lens or a specialised motor in OnePlus 7 Pro like they did in OnePlus 7T Pro. As a result, you don't get a specialised MACRO Mode.6) The telephone camera does not support video recording and nightscape. OnePlus should address this issue with a software update.7) No headphones are provided. At this price point, a decent pair of headphones are seriously expected.8) Pricing- I got this mobile during Amazon Great Indian festival for around 43k. I feel this price to be a bit on the higher side. 40k is perfect for this mobile.So considering all the above points, I would rate it 4.5 and will recommend this mobile to someone who wants a fast and smooth Android experience without any bloatware and one of the best cameras available right now.\n\n", "\n\n  Pros: 1. 90 hz (it takes you to another world)  2. Ui speed awesome  3. Charging speed mind boggling.  4. Haptic feedback best in class.  5. Sound quality of speakers awesome  6. A big thanks for the speed of phone.CONS: 1. Poor battery backup (battery drains rapidly)  2. Camera just an average (it kills originality of photos, make face a bit pinkish.)Don't know when one plus camera are going to justify it's price.  3. Handsfree/Bluetooth earpods sound below average. Didn't expected this from one plus.Tried different components handsfree /earpods same result.  3. Weight management very poor.  4. As phone is huge in size, functionality should be at bottom of phone. I hope one plus will do something.\n\n", "\n\n  Dislike: Camera is medicore. Don't fall in marketing gimmick of 48 MP., Precision, blah!  blah!Selfie camera has inbuilt face smoothening effect.

(Yes, you read it correctly- dishaped)Likes: battery lifeOverall if you are looking for a good camera phone look out for other options..\n\n", '\n\n  Best one from One Plus.

And in the box only normal  case cover is there and no protection on display screen it's just coated with plastic strips. Atleast provide screen guard glass in the box.. and the main thing is that no screen guard available in the market.\n\n", "\n\n  Phone is utter waste and not worth buing this flgship phone ......phone gets heated while normal useage and while playing games the phone feels like something hot substance and it shows the message like phone is heating and temperature is increasing please switch off the phone until Cool down and battery goes like just water ....not worth for 4000mah battery doesn't work it just gives 4 hours backup and I need to charge again and again ......it has lagging issues they said which they will be fixing in coming updates but there is no updates regarding that mid range phones are far better than this OnePlus 7 pro regretted buying this phone\n\n", "\n\n  As expected, OP7Pro is best phone i ever used.. very smooth. Finishing looks great with curvy structure. and i have no words for its performance,really it is behond expectafion.But still one problem, OP didn't provided typeC to 3.5mm converter in the box. You have to spent some 400 extra to purchace that or you have to go for bullets 2.0.. but this phone is great.\n\n", "\n\n  Great product.Snappy and superfast as u will expect from a Oneplus phone.Packed with the powerful Snapdragon 855 processor.Camera also excellent especially after update.Battery life surprisingly good and that Warp Charge is ultra fast.Display is best that any smartphone can get with 1440p Oled display and refresh rate of 90 Hz which sets it apart from competition.Gaming is the best experience with this display and powerful processor. Can play PUBG on HDR and Extreme graphics without any sort of lag. Too smooth.In display fingerprint scanner is the fastest I've ever seen.10 layer cooling tech works like wonders. Its nearly impossible to get this phone too hot. Even after long periods of gaming it stays cool.\n\n", '\n\n  I am writing this review after 9.5.10 update & after using it for more than 1 month.Pros:1.Display (though brightness could have been better) - My friends are just awestrucked by the quality of display OnePlus has put in. They say "ufff!! Display ta dekh just, chokchok kor6e" (Look at the display, it\'s shining), "Side theke dekh, sera, sera, kato daam re phone tar, amio kinbo" (look at from the sides, awesome, awesome, how much does this phone cost,I will also buy it).2.Battery life - 1 day battery backup for heavy users. If used in dark mode and 30-40% brightness in auto switch & 90hz mode you may get upto 1.5 days battery life. But even if the battery get drained warp charge will charge it in an hour.3. Vibration - Best among most of the android phones out there but only bettered by iphone.4. Performance - Best performer till date. Oneplus\'s software is the benchmark for the mobile industry. Take a bow oneplus.5. Sound Quality -  Loud & Crisp. Though a little more depth would have been appreciated.CONS1. Camera - Camera is a mixed bag. It takes inconsistent photos. But yesterday I received 9.5.10 update which corrected the over warm tone of the photos. People don\'t look too pinkish & focusing is also improved. Wide angle lens can\'t be used in videos as of now but oneplus is working on an update & will introduce this feature surely. Selfies are ok. In comparison to pixel & iphone & samsung\'s flagship phones this camera may be inferior,but I have to say oneplus is able to improve the camera performance of this mobile through multiple updates. Now I am satisfied with the camera performance of this beast. Camera isn\'t a deal breaker anymore.2. Lack of headphone jack - Even the type c to 3.5mm headphone is not included within the box & after 2 months of this phone\'s launch oneplus is still not able to make it available to purchase from online or offline stores. Shame on you oneplus. You couldn\'t give an adapter worth ‚Çπ390 (manufacturing cost is ‚Çπ40) in the box of a ‚Çπ50k rupees phone. This is my biggest gripe using this phone. But it\'s a fault of OnePlus not the phone.Edit : Today I bought oneplus\'s official audio adapter from their website for ‚Çπ439 (including shipping fee).3. No IP rating & wireless charging - though I don\'t need them.4. Customer Support - No where near the quality of this phone. Few service centres are available. Most of the accessories are out of stock. I am very disappointed with the service of oneplus.5. Tempered glass - No official tempered glass launched by oneplus for op 7 pro whereas it\'s available for the regular 7. I purchased an uv glue glass from a local shop worth ‚Çπ600 & the glues are spreading from the sides of the phone. Oneplus should have released their official tempered glass for their best phone.6. Price - I read from the internet that the manufacturing cost of this phone is ‚Çπ22k. But you are charging more than  double the manufacturing cost. This phone should have been priced at ‚Çπ40k,though it\'s cheaper than samsung and apple\'s flagships.ConclusionMost of the cons I mentioned are related to the support of oneplus not of this phone. Hence,I would suggest everyone who is looking to buy a real flagship, take this one & you won\'t regret.Final rating9.5/10\n\n', "\n\n  Best phone ever, the only problem is sometimes while selecting photos using watsapp, it's getting stuck. I checked with one of my friends as well, he too had the same issue. Hopefully this will resolve in future patchings\n\n", '\n\n  Honestly i love iphone and from the reviews and ratings of this product considered me to buy this phone but my previous phone iPhone 7 was too good and i was not too happy with my new android so i gave this oneplus to my sister and bought iPhone 11 and im very happy with my decision.For me no phone is better than apple iPhone i mean iphones are the leader of phone industry and for this oneplus I don‚Äôt like this phone too much i mean its good for those who likes to live with android.\n\n', "\n\n  First of all I regret buying a Chinese mobile phone and I urge all my Indian brother and sister to stop buying any Chinese mobile or any article to extent possible.

Not regreting. Being launched on May19, Not feeling outdated, even after next gen onplus phones are out. Still getting good battery life out of it, without any compromise in preformance. Camera quality is ok, but not the best. You can get good images, if you tweek some settings while in pro cam. Excelent choice for the price range.\n\n', '\n\n  Amazingly quick phone, was under some doubts when i read the reviews which were negative about this phone while the overall rating was better then 4 star! All doubts cleared though as i have been using it since last week.I have cut one star because i believe it can improve further on camera and fingerprint sensitivity as well as few tweaks in software (like u cant seperately lower down notification volume); otherwise, it is a phone to have in 50k range!\n\n', "\n\n  Some time Touch sensor doesn't response so advice me what to do after 11 day of purchase m facing problem .camera quality is not up to Mark standard ,don't know problem is my phone or it's a OnePlus quality standard.immidiate after purchase I request to give me seller contact details but not provided to me , Don't know why .RegardsPunit\n\n", '\n\n  Display - 5/5Performance - 4.5/5Charging - 5/5User Interface - 4/5Sound - 4/5Camera - 4/5Fingerprint reader - 3.5/5Weight - 2/5Pop up selfie camera - 4.5/5Feel - 4.5/5Value for money - 4/5\n\n', '\n\n  I am using this phone from past one month and trust me guys, one of the best phone in the market right now. Battery life is far better than my previous samsung flagship phones. Camera is good but the main thing is display. Best display in market right now. Amazing sound quality. No comparison in terms of performance and charging is amazingly fast. Only drawback is regarding the notifications i.e. there is no AOD and notification LED so you have to wake up the phone each time to check whether you have received notification or not.\n\n', '\n\n  Excellent phone ! LovedFan of OnePlus mobiles , quality is amazing , Glossy finish makes it look more beautifulBattery performance = 5 starDispay : 5 starSpeed : 4 starCamera : 4 starOs : 5 star\n\n', '\n\n  Oneplus 7 pro is a gorgeous device, looks great, feels great while in hand. Glass back with matte finish combined with curved glass adds a touch of premiumness to the phone. I have done some nitpicking although after thorough use of the device for 4 days.1. Fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow sometimes. I have heard that it keeps on improving as days pass by. But it is annoying sometimes.2. SOT is somewhat between 5-6 hours with normal usage,  it would have been good to have around 4500mah battery capacity.3. Sensors does not work smoothly every time, auto brightness is aweful, fingerprint unlock misses one out of five times and pick up your phone to show has low response.4. Phone is heavy, would require time to get adjusted.5. Photo quality is great at daylights, but at night the corners get washed out a bit.6. Horizon light feature is just laughable, it happens only for a single time once a notification pops up and not at a certain interval.7. No 3.5mm headphone jack.None of the google, samsung, apple or huwaei provides latest flagship below 50k price range, so if you can live with the cons mentioned above, then happily buy this device.One more point, got the android 10 update on the same day I received the device from amazon. Thumbs up for oneplus support.\n\n', "\n\n  Have being using it since last 2 days .. Didn't find any feature which is new or unique to 1+7 series. In fact there r lots of good features in my last mobile Honor 8X which I found missing in this.Big disappointment is1) Fast battery discharge. Full charge lasted for 21 hrs only.2) Dual sim reduced functionality.3) Android 9.04) Settings very complex\n\n", '\n\n  Good and speedier product, suitable for business as well as personal use. MS Office works very fine. Curved screen gives extra large viewing. Easy to hold. Original karboon back cover adds to its business-look.Battery easily lasts three days at moderate use.

Whether it's about taking pictures or watching that high-res video song is just a matter of pure indulgence. Totally in love with the 90 Hz Display that gives videos and live wallpapers an extra fluid factor. Camera quality is superb and the overall processor response is like overwhelmingly good. Initially there were some lags with opening of the camera those are not present now after the updates. Kudos to the OnePlus Team for giving a nice finish to the exterior look and overall aesthetics of the Phone. True Notch-less Experience that is worth owning.\n\n", "\n\n  Overall average product for the price i paid. The disaster is internet speed is superrrrrrrr slow in this.  i was using oneplus3 previously and switched to this model now and now I can't use internet at all. Beware before buying this product.\n\n", '\n\n  its a great phone in this price segment.  best display, premiums looks and built quality, the fastest phone, smoother experience, best choice for heavy gamers and for the best graphics..the only con is average berry life.. if you are a heavy user..u will have to charge twice in 24 hours..but quick Dash charge is super fast.. so if twice charging in a single day is ok then go for it..face unlock is but slower as popup camera takes time to get opened. overall its the best flagship smart phone if your budget is around 40-50k..\n\n', "\n\n  Super awesome product in such a cheaper price. It's my first time using android phone and have to say that one plus delivers a very premium quality in such a low price. I would everytime recommend this product to those who are thinking to buy apple or samsung smartphone, just give this phone a try it will never disappoint you. The fingerprint scanner, camera, gaming experience, movie watching experience are some of the things has always been at the top notch for me.\n\n", "\n\n  I had an option of getting the S10+ or the OP 7 Pro. Glad I went for the latter. Firstly, I do not spend big bucks on a phone for camera. I base my purchases on a phone for the performance and the speed.  Even though the camera is not as good as S10+  the OP 7 Pro makes up for it by having notchless display and 90 Hz. When people say there's hardly any difference  between 60 Hz and 90 Hz it is not true.  I also went for 12 Gb option so this helps battery draining apps to run in the background. Only issue is the battery does not meet my expectations and the whole charge barely lasts 18 hours.\n\n", '\n\n  Worst product because at this price this is not water proof and they claim it as water resistant but that is not true as my phone screen got completely damaged in minor rain. Don‚Äôt buy this at this price.\n\n', '\n\n  Everything is superb ....minor changes needed....battery life could be better but good as compared to the display size and quality.....the dispaly and camera are the best one....Get a major issue with the device.....its get swtich off as i connect it to charging......one month review.....i really hate one plus now.....first one plus device may be the last one tooo.....\n\n', '\n\n  Product is as per description. Screen guard had bubble. Camera quality is good.Battery when charged 100% will run full day. Speed is good.\n\n', '\n\n  Firstly, a great phone, all the features which it has right from the notchless display to the 90Hz refresh rate coupled with the space and the UFS 3.0 transmission, this device works buttery smoothWith the android 10 update now availale, the phone has only improved system and UI experience wise with dark mode and the addition of digital well-being.Though a bit overpriced than Redmi K20 pro, i feel if you really want a great UI experience with the Oxygen OS and dont mind spending a little more for a phone, this phone will serve you atleast 3-4 years making it value for money\n\n', '\n\n  Let me begin by saying that the display is just amazing. Everything is buttery smooth and fast. Coming to the fingerprint scanner it could be better because sometimes it takes time to read. Face id is fast, although i have nothing else to compare it with but still good. And camera to be honest is actually good and night mode is little bit sumdgy somtimes but still captures good night pictures. Video recording is the best i gotta say, it is very stable. The only problem i found about the video is the 4k 60 fps mode, the file size is so large it is actually impossible to record more than 10 mins which would probably take about 10gb of memory. The front camera is also pretty decent. Coming to the os its one of the best i have used and all the apps function very very smoothly. If you are planning to go for iphone in the same range i would recommend to go for oneplus 7 pro since its a much better buy.\n\n', '\n\n  My most loved android till date. I‚Äôm using Samsung galaxy s10 plus too. But One Plus 7 Pro is a gem in 57k.

Very much dissatisfied\n\n', '\n\n  I am going to write a short review...The packaging and the delivery was fast got the product 2days before delivery date..thanx to amazon.Coming to the product,For me the screen which is quad hd display along with 90hz refresh rate was the main reason i choose the phone.. Display(9.5/10)Battery backup depends on the purpose you are using the phone for, for heavy usage it should last around 7 hours and in light to medium usage it should last for a whole day.. Battery(7.5/10)Camera is the weakness that one plus devices have been facing the most..but thanx to the software updates and good software optimisation the camera is now good although if you are looking for a camera centric phone this is not the phone u are looking for.. Camera(7/10)Special Note- This is not the best phone but with all the hardware and software optimisation this is the perfect balance that one plus has achieved and i must say that the display only is enough to blow you away...hope this helps you.\n\n', "\n\n  The best phone you could get in this price range, oxygen OS is the best feature of this phone, it's butter smooth and responsive. Screen quality is good but not in par with Samsung's, 90 Hz screen is a delight to use. Camera also not in par with Samsung and Apple but at this price point we can't complain. Rest everything is better or same than what we get in Apple or Samsung. Buy it without a thought if Camera is not much a priority.\n\n", '\n\n  The phone as usual is very very good. Great display..good battery.. awesome camera..pubg play is very very smooth. The only disappointment was that there waa no type c to 3.5 mm dongle.

What's the point of having a 8 gb ram when you can only utiliez only 2 gb at a time. Company is holding on to the 12gb ram version and Nubia red magic 3 is just around the conner.

Its undoubtedly the flagship killer at this price.\n\n', "\n\n  No doubt at present it's the best phone available in the world. At first I thought it's a bit costly but after using it for a month take my word it's worth every penny.I will not mention the features as we all know it, but it's really super fast, the touch is excellent, display has no match and it is super smooth, battery can easily last for full day even with heavy use and the wrap charger fulls it very quickly. Finger print reader has no match, it has great camera with some great features, very good quality even in low light. Friends Oneplus 7pro really is a great Masterpiece by Oneplus.Those making mind to buy but are a little doubtful........ take my word, buy it with closed eyes, you will Love it. Thanks Amazon for 2 day delivery.\n\n", '\n\n  Am cutting one star for not having any headphone jack also the OnePlus wireless earphones are too high.Regarding other performance so far so good you can go for it.\n\n', "\n\n  Like:1. Superb screen. It's incredible. Maybe the best that I have seen on a mobile device.2. Great battery life and charging speeds for such a power house.Dislike:1. The camera is really really bad for the hype they created.2. Can't stress enough, camera is sub-par. Especially when you take pictures from third party apps in low light.\n\n", "\n\n  OnePlus forgot it's customer first policy, also quality of OnePlus 7 and onwards series are not upto the mark.Their is no premium quality left and the brand is now into mass production of low grade device and supplying in India.\n\n", '\n\n  Simply the best deal in the Android world right now. Stupendously quick and delightful performance! Forget all the reviews saying average battery life, I get 7 hours with 90 hz, qhd+, wifi and location on all the time.Love the nebula blue gradient. And the screen, o my god! What a treat.\n\n', "\n\n  Can't go back to a phone with an 60 hz display after using this one for a couple of months it's an steal deal for 40K , display is awesome and camera's are fine not bad not too good but charging speed is so good that it can beat any phone , was confused between iphone 11 and op 7 but I am glad that I saved my 20k and also got an better phone\n\n", '\n\n  A great product. Still given a rating of 3 *. Why? I bought he product  and within 2 weeks a new product has come. Another 2 weeks later yet another product. Not sure if I have paid the right price. Since it was released in such a quick succession, OnePlus should have provided a price protection. Hence, I had given a rating of 3\n\n', '\n\n  Everything is good , except for the camera quality especially the portrait mode . One plus 5 gives better images than one plus 7 pro . Not worth paying 52k . Oppo k3 is equally good\n\n', '\n\n  It is having the best display quality and performance-wise it is best phone in the range of 35k-50k.Front camera is not good as onplus 7 but it will be resolved after software updates. Battery drains faster while using 90Hz refresh rate but in normal use battery stands 24-36 hours. If you are planning to purchase after April-2020 then I will suggest you to buy oneplus 8.Little problematic to use face lock. The popup camera open then scan and lock will open. Pop camera is not user-friendly for face lock , this is my general point of view for the pop up camera phones. This popup camera is removed from onplus 8.\n\n', '\n\n  Best flagship till now üòéhappy to have this phone! camera is gud but it can be best by software update .I love the night mode ,screen is superb .so smooth\n\n', '\n\n  Phone is just amazing...every time i unlock it i just fell in love with the beautiful display...Super fast processing, design is quite good, speakers on this device give a totally different experience while watching movies and playing games.Little dowsides of the device includes-1)Camera:- I am not saying its bad,its above average but one plus could have used a better camera setup just to match this phones other flagship features.2) Battery life: battery% goes a lill fast but can be overcome  with its 30 watts warp charger which is so fast that in just couple of minutes it gets hours of power to manage the tasks.Overall my experience with this phone till date is quite amazing.\n\n', '\n\n  Loved the camera. High speed gaming. 90hz refresh rate makes video watching smooth. Overall great. But you need to charge the photo every day. But charging is super fast. If you have a budget of 50K then go for this phone.\n\n', "\n\n  This is perhaps the best bet if you are looking for a good smart and a sexy Android phone. With the latest OS and other features, the phone stands out at par. I have been using the phone since 3 weeks now and I love it's screen and the video quality. It got great camera too.\n\n", '\n\n  I purchased this phone and facing hang and network issue.. i have complaint to one plus they told me for reset, after reset facing same issue.. i have contact to one plus but no reply from one plus side.. costomer care not picked up call, i have mailed, they register my complaint but no action taken on complaint till after 15 day.. again i have summited complaint but still no response\n\n', '\n\n  I bought this Oneplus 7pro after using Oneplus 3T for almost 3 years. There is nothing I can complain about. At this price range Oneplus is providing very standard hardware. This makes the phone last longer than any other devices of this price range.\n\n', "\n\n  I don't know why I'm seeing so many negative reviews, personally, I haven't seen any issues so far from past 1 week of usage.The camera is not up to the mark but I hope future updates will solve this. Every product has its pros and cons.Hope one plus solves the issues related to the camera.\n\n", "\n\n  hi ,Pros:Displaycons:Less battery life , can't take fast pics coz three cameras but good picsBit heavy phonehmmm immersive display so pro of display will rule off restSo don't think much i have thought too much  for 4 months and bought finally but it's worth it guysAs compared with samsung s6 and this is better\n\n", '\n\n  just not able to finish the setup process and its heating like crazy.Didnt expect this from OnePlus7 Pro, its highly frustrating\n\n', '\n\n  I have been a loyal customer of One Plus.... but the problem I am facing with this phone is that there is no option for cellular/data back up of photos in the backup &Sync section. It only says waiting for wifi. I am clueless what to do about it. This option was clearly available in my previous One Plus phone.\n\n', '\n\n  The phone is awesome after around two updates the camera quality goes better and the fingerprint reader is accurate and fast.Display is awesome and crisp colours are observed. Battery life at first will be somewhat less but as phone adjusts to the usage, the battery life will go up.\n\n', "\n\n  A great device with great specs.The display is simply great and now I don't feel like using any other device after using this display.Oxygen OS is fantastic.Warp Charge is very Handy.The camera is also great, although a bit confusing in some aspects.Now runs on Android 10.I couldn't ask for anything more.\n\n", "\n\n  Every thing is good with this machine, it works too fast ... That is unbelievably quick ..... Moving to camera  it is not top notch but you can get good pictures with it ...other than that it is an awesome phone I am experiencing for th 4 th month and to this day it hasn't disappointed me . Kudos to you ..., It's edge screen is an eye catching feature that people will admire.Ps: I was using galaxy grand duos and switched to this just this year and everything in it is worth the money\n\n", '\n\n  This is my first one plus device and I am quite impressed with the quality of the phone, however I faced an issue where the camera app kept crashing for which I rebotted the device and the issue got solved. I hope that is just a temporary glitch. The portrait mode works only in telephoto mode and is quite annoying for indoor photography. Hope we get a software update for this. battery charging is very fast and last for a day very comfortably.\n\n', "\n\n  No water resistant, but product pdf says water resistant to some extent by this they making us tempt to buy. But finaly dening warranty for water issues.Don' t buy this, oneplus and amazon won't help, all of them simply cheating customers.\n\n", "\n\n  Don't go by the media uplift of the product. It's not worth the money. Still need a lot of software updation, new issues are arising as one is getting solved. Camera is not so great as they say. But looks good & feels good too so if you don't care about small issues then go for it who am I to stop you?\n\n", "\n\n  Everything thing is good, but sometimes it hang while charging.One thing I notice after 2 month on back side of phone glass I observed some minor scratches even I always use back cover.they should improve quality of back glass.It'll become Heavy if you use back cover and glass.\n\n", "\n\n  Woderful phone, love many things,...charge within 1hr. Wt- slightly heavy..got use to it.Front camera not so good. All other things are very good. Price is high..fingerprint reader is ok...camera quality is also improved after new update. But camera quality is avarage when u click photo of news paper. U can't read the words.

U'll never ever seen before. I'm very happy for this product. My favorite colour is blue üíô. Nebulla blue is the only colour which gives u a royal look. Battery life is better.

If not, kindly guide how to cover the oneplus 7 pro 12gb Ram 256GB Storage can be covered in the warranty.Also i had taken a number of gift cards/booking card for oneplus pro phone. however i could not place order till 15th june as 12GB RAM product was hardly available for booking. Pls confirm that my purchase is covered under screen protection.RgdsMunindra\n\n', "\n\n  Best Android phone you will ever need.I have been using this for 4 months and it works as smooth as butter. I have the 12gb RAM with 256gb memory variant. Has zero glitches while running CPU intensive apps. The selfie camera mechanism is quite sturdy and safe. All in all, whatever OnePlus claims for this phone is true. The only con is that it doesn't come with a type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter/ converter.\n\n", "\n\n  Its a beast interms of performance. Oxygen OS is as smooth as always and its get better and better day by day. Updates are always on time. Interms of camera it's good but not the best as compared to the competition. Still waiting for the updated camera software which was promised by the OnePlus team during the launch of this phone. Battery life is better than average but not so good for heavy users.\n\n", '\n\n  If you are android user and you want something fast in your life than go for it best device in terms of everything\n\n', "\n\n  Support is pathetic, they don't even to bother to respond to emails or phone calls.It is like u buy the phone and forget you will get any service from them.Phone has issues after using a while which can be fixed by support but they do not provide any help\n\n", '\n\n  Beware, the back glass will cracks itself within 2-3months on its own even using the proper case. Check yourself the one plus support community thread , numerous cases are listed with same problem with same pattern . One plus plus just another mediocre quality smartphone company\n\n', '\n\n  Mobile are too good\n\n', '\n\n  The phone is little heavier than previous OnePlus models, I understand 4000 battery and big screen. Otherwise it deliverd as promised. Initially it fails 2-3 time during initial setup due to software glitch but hard-reboot helped to restore the error. The mobile is a charm.\n\n', '\n\n  The only thing I resent about this phone is the exclusion of the headphone adapter/dongle in the box. Oh and the cheap quality tpu case that comes with it. Dick move OnePlus!Phone is great however, though for the asking price of 58K it better be.\n\n', "\n\n  A good device. Review after 3 months. The best part is it's display. Finger print reader and face recognition are in the higher level. Camera is ok but not awesome. Battery is also up to the satisfactory level. Recommended to purchase in place of Apple devices if want to enjoy the Android platform. You can get more details in YouTube. 5 out of 5 stars.\n\n", '\n\n  This mobile phone is awesome in this series. After using for 1 month I realise that this phone is the best amongst other flagship mobile phones. Camera filters needs to be reviewed by OnePlus . No network issues at all. 90 hz display is wonderful. Overall excellent product\n\n', '\n\n  I was sceptical before ordering almond colour but it looks amazing in person. Pictures on Amazon do zero justice to actual look of the phone. I am so glad I got this one. Needless to talk about features because it is OnePlus after all.\n\n', '\n\n  I absolutely liked the mobile. There is no ifs and buts. Looks are super. Feel is even more super. Charging speed is excellent. Usage is very easy. Finger scan is good. Highly recommended in the high end mobile category. Must buy.\n\n', '\n\n  Overall the phone is awesome camera ,batter, lookwise, soundquality without earphones, popup camera tottaly best phone Only one thing i dnt like that oneplus should provide c to 3.5  converter for  earphones  must...have a 100% look on this... And if they  then plz send me 1 pair... Eles tge the phone is best\n\n', "\n\n  If you think you can live without headphone jack, think again. Get Bluetooth headphones and it's the best phone in the world.Battery / charging speedScreen (dimensions and resolution)PerformanceAudio (speaker)GamingEverything is top notch.Camera is also okay... You won't be able to tell the difference. Pop up camera works fine.The case provided by OnePlus sucks... So get that also.\n\n", "\n\n  The basics tenants of smartphone design weren't radically challenged the previous year.But 2019 ,brought a few exceptional releases.And this is the phone I am talking about....Saying this an expensive is a contradiction.In today's days of industrialization and globalization, both life and time is synonymous. And running with this phone is much easier as compared to today's world.Not only it has best features but has an awesome look. Finally, this phone is incredible...\n\n", "\n\n  Gud one  ..I bought this phone last week..and all bad rumors are wrong about it...This is an amazing phone in everything ..specially in games it it so smooth , let it be PUBG or any other high graphic games ..and it's battery charging and Curved (looks like 3D) is awesomeüòò ...Also reviews about 1 or 2 star for this smartphone are all from fake bad marketers or morons .

Overall look of the handset is fine but it keeps getting hanged while talking and it's touch sensor is not up to the mark . Overall i am not happy with the handset i received,  i don''t know whether store has given an old/used handset to me because other friends of mine are using the same phone but they are not finding this issue as such and they bought it from Chroma.\n\n", '\n\n  amazing design and display quality.facelock,fingerprint lock super.performance is terrible.battery is not bad.white balance of the camera is little bad.anyway nice product.i really liked it.OnePlus give me an amazing product.\n\n', '\n\n  One plus is a big brand now.over all features of phone is good.but I am really disappointed with one plus not even proving any kind of earphone or earphone jack as well..now a day if I am purchasing a nokia1280 worth rs 1000 also providing earphones & one plus 7 pro Is of 53k bro..highly disappointed\n\n', '\n\n  After a couple of months the face unlock and fingerprint stopped working.

I would have serviced it but seriously, what phone gets damaged within couple of months? Not even half a year has passed and I had to resell it. Definitely not a quality buy.\n\n', '\n\n  Really very fluid experience. 90 Hz refresh rate really makes everything look much smoother. The battery life is great. Fingerprint sensor is a bit slow, but the whole screen without any notch and a 90 Hz display combined with very less Bezels makes it the best value for money on the market.\n\n', "\n\n  This was the immediate response:Fingerprint sensor could have been better. Battery life is awesome. Display is again a thumbs up. Earphones absence in the box had let me down. But over a good phone, may little over priced I felt.After 11 months usage:Definitely not worth the money. It's only a spec sheet phone. It hangs a lot. I have gone service center almost 5 times. And their services is again not customer centric. Phone still hangs often. It gets heated up like hell. Sometimes I can't hold it, it gets that hot while charging or sometimes when I play games. Really pathetic and strongly against getting this phone!\n\n"]
