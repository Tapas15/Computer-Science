Heating problem while charging.. etc  i am really  very frustrated with this phone quality.. i lost my money by buying this phone..üòîüòîüò™\n\n', '\n\n  Mind blowing  camera real monster battery look awesome and fist first launch first hand\n\n', '\n\n  Average\n\n', '\n\n  Phone is very slow my opinion is west ur money\n\n', "\n\n  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. üëç\n\n", '\n\n  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\n\n', "\n\n  I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made.

Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3.

Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4.

Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.\n\n", '\n\n  Camara is too bad.

Think before buying this phone.\n\n", "\n\n  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest‚Ä¢ PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.‚Ä¢ DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)‚Ä¢ BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.‚Ä¢CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device.

One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5.

CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.Camera is also not very good.To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.\n\n", '\n\n  Very bed bettery backup\n\n', "\n\n  Bad ever phone I have buy now going to return it back .... in YouTube channels  10hrs continue battery but in reality poor battery performance once you play a game it reduce up to 30percent battery every bad performance.... camera quality that shown by youtubers in reality 64MP doesn't  evn give its 40percent....poor fake quality  display of Samsung and I was always right about it ....\n\n", '\n\n  After using one week i have these experience with Samsung Galaxy M31.Pros: Attractive design.Screen size is handy at 6.4 inch.Good camera,both selfie and main at 32mp and 64 mp.Cons:Phone is heating very much.It heats always when charging,gaming and using internet.Charging is very slow.Even it is having 6000 mah battery, it drains very fast.In standby position also it comes from 100% to 80% overnight.Very disappointing.If this is fixed after any updates I will update my review.After two weeks of usage I am updating.After writing to Samsung members they suggested me some changes in settings.Now my mobile performing well.After 2 months, again I am adding.After updating two times no heating issue.Battery lasts for two days even after full day use.Satisfied.\n\n', "\n\n  Sorry but this time Amazon and Samsung really disappointed me.I have bought samsung m30 and m30 S earlier from Amazon and it was really a Goood great deal. But this time it was very disappointing and shameful. I bought m31 megamonster for my soulmate but she really got disappointed with phone and it was really hurting for me.Poor camera quality like a 2 megapixel cameraNot 64mpPoor battery like 3500mAh not 6000mAhDON'T BUY M31 U CAN GO FOR M30S. SORRY SAMSUNG\n\n", "\n\n  A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.\n\n", "\n\n  I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.\n\n", '\n\n  Worst battery..its takes 2.5-3 hours to fully charge may be 3.3 hours. Battery life okay. offen hands while scrolling WhatsApp of Instagram. Screen gets black out every day for 5- 10 seconds.Camera is good.M series in total not good..earlier bought m20 got sick in 12 days company says not replacement , service service also repaired  but it got hanging problem again now m20 is in useless.\n\n', "\n\n  Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels).Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones.Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardwareFinally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands.Infact my first samsung phone.While configuration, received security patch and UI updatesFrom user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefullySuper happy user since 3days. No complaints or regret on buying the phone.\n\n", "\n\n  I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.\n\n", "\n\n  Very poor quality, phone touch stopped responding on few areas suddenly. Didn't expected this from Samsung. I am not able to use from a month.. :(Tried connecting customer service and they asked to go service center when it opens after lockdown. On asking whether my warranty period would be extended due to this, they completely denied.. I am feeling cheated now. :((Don't buy this phone !!\n\n", "\n\n  Review after 2 days of useScreen - 2 good..animations and transition very good, I won't miss hype around 90hz refresh rateSamsung OS- one UI 2.0 is good but I personally don't like the home screen, using Lawnchair launcher for home screen and dock...Like other features of OneUI2.0Games- Cant say, I dont use mobile for gamingBattery- charged only once til now, so far so goodCamera- Love live focus by samsung..Boehner is applied to all faces in pic, daylight pics and Videos are awesome, yet to test night modeCamera after 10days- indoor and low light is below average and a let down by Samsung.This is my first Samsung Smartphone and I am glad I bought itOpinion after 10 days- reducing rating to 3stars\n\n", "\n\n  Poor camera and display quality. Its not a 64 MP camera it's  quality is like 8 MP camera. Flash is not working in 64 MP ratio.And Amazon is also not returning this item. Vivo gives more quality in this price range.

There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?\n\n", '\n\n  I don\'t know this issue for all M31 devices or only my device. Camera quality is very very very bad.. If you do little zoom, you can see black lines are coming and going..If you record video, more than 30 minutes..getting message "camera not responding message"...Not happy with the audio\n\n', '\n\n  Charging time up switch of me 6 hour me 51%Or battery life lowMaick me problem\n\n', '\n\n  Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.\n\n', "\n\n  It's really amazing product...smooth operations...huge battery backup...premium look....feel is superb.....

First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.\n\n", '\n\n  It is not 10 days that i have got this phone. But having issues in hearing some one talk from the other side or at times, the other person on the call cannot hear you. it is clear that the microphone are bad and not serving the purpose of a phone. When you play music, you can see that the volume of the song just fading off and at a point you just cannot hear any noise from the phone.When I try to return the phone its asking to install a smart check app and only if the app says there is some defect, they would take the phone back. If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one.And another point to note is that, I trusted that I would be happy with this phone, hence had purchased a special phone cover. now that money is also a waste.\n\n', '\n\n  sir, I  purchased the mobile with much excitement that it would provide a wonderful experience but actually the product is not worth purchasing. After using the phone for 3 to 4 weeks the system asked for an update of the software but as soon as I downloaded the update and installed it. My mobile crashed and I can do nothing on the phone. It is neither getting switched off nor restarted. So what type of help you can provide me in this regard. I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.\n\n', "\n\n  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.\n\n", '\n\n  I can\'t believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I\'d need to pay if anything is broken. What\'s the warranty for? I asked what\'s the "Gorilla Glass" for if it couldn\'t handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, "We are insiders. So we understand these things, there\'s no such thing as "gorilla vorilla" it\'s a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you\'ll have to pay for this."I can\'t believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this "insider" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.\n\n', "\n\n  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!\n\n", "\n\n  Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\n\n", "\n\n  The phone is very amazing it's more than expectation. I ordered black version with 6GB of ram and 128 GB space. Best smartphone in this segment price. The trump card  of this phone is camera.

Please don't buy Samsung M series. AND after 3 months NOW comes new update fast charging is worked. 16 jun 2020 .Thank You\n\n", '\n\n  This is the Galaxy M31 review after a week use.Bought this phone to replace my existing iPhone SE after watching so many videos of tech reviews which are continuously bashing Apple for providing low specs mobiles. After a week, I realised that I made severe mistake by acknowledging their words. The 64 MP camera is nowhere near my 4 year old iPhone‚Äôs 12 MP camera. Macro camera is another joke in this package.Performance:  Galaxy M31 has ‚Äòso called‚Äô 6 GB RAM but works like 100MB RAM device. 3 GB RAM will always be occupied and you can‚Äôt do anything about that. Say what, you are free to use 3 GB RAM only. Even my Windows 10 OS use only 1.5 GB RAM. And even my older Moto E ( yes, Moto E) works better than this phone in scrolling through internet. About gaming, it‚Äôs bad joke. My 4 years old iPhone SE runs seamlessly even in 2GB RAM.Tech people always boast about Android that it‚Äôs customisable. What customisation would serve if your phone is not even working properly? You aren‚Äôt even allowed to uninstall Netflix and they keep talking about customisations.Battery life is pretty good though. At least they did good in this case. 6000mAh lives for 1.5 to 2 days in normal use.Another feature provided with this phone is heating. Just some normal activities will heat up your Galaxy M31 so much that you can pretty much use it as heater in winters. Not joking here.I bought 64 GB variant, and only 47 GB was usable. Android system is taking 13-14 GB in the system. Really?Overall, not happy with purchase. Waste of 16.5K with this garbage product.Samsung, you can so way better than this!!\n\n', "\n\n  Very bad product. There are so many issue.1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.3. Sound is also not good.4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone. Samsung  are fooling the amezon customer.Don't buy.\n\n", "\n\n  From the user of Samsung Guru 1200, Metro duos C3322, Mertro XL, Galaxy On5 Pro to this Galaxy M31 & going to use Note series after some months & as a Samsung fan I'm honestly writing this review. This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone. Touchscreen is too much sensitive but this sAMOLED screen is just superb, awesome and 6000mAh battery will give you a long lasting usage after one full charge. Otherwise it's an all in one phone.The new problem which I'm facing now(after using it 2 months) is, if the data connection is on with 1st SIM and at that time if any SMS comes to 2nd SIM then the data connection get lost fully until I active the airplane mode & then deactivate it. It makes a lot of problem during banking transactions with OTPs.\n\n", '\n\n  First of all, my first review was deleted by amazon, saying its manipulating the context and feature of product..This is a review section so i can give my honest review but amazon is deleting it thats dumb.. If u dont need reviews than block it for all. Why would u only keep only positive reviews and delete any negative points????Here is the thing- battry is not uoto mark.. It drains quickly.. And it takes more than 2.5 hrs say 3 hrs as per my personal experience.Camera is good.Battery is a nightmare if u want to keep it charging after every 2 hrs than go ahead .and last time i gave 2 stars.. But u deleted the comment so this time take the 1 star for the product.. Coz its really a peice of shirt. You know twhat i mean üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÜ\n\n', "\n\n  As consider price point galaxy m31 is very high in price because of the performance, camera quality, processor and design wise its very dull and boring in real life and also heatup very quickly when Playing games. And one more thing in galaxy m31 also have ads like redmi, realme, oppo and vivo. Samsung simply cheat you and looting you.I must said please don't waste your money on waste galaxy m31 because at this price you have very better option available in market. Samsung also leak and stole our data as like other companies so their is no difference between Chinese company and Samsung. If you not agree with me than just read carefully user agreement, terms and user policy of Samsung.\n\n", '\n\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 smartphone runs on Android v10 (Q) operating system. The phone is powered by Octa core (2.3 GHz, Quad core, Cortex A73 + 1.7 GHz, Quad core, Cortex A53) processor. It runs on the Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 Chipset. It has 6 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage.Samsung Galaxy M31 smartphone has a Super AMOLED display. It measures 159.2 mm x 75.1 mm x 8.9 mm and weighs 191 grams. The screen has a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 403 ppi pixel density. It has an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and screen-to-body ratio of 83.92 %. On camera front, the buyers get a 32 MP f/2.0 Primary Camera(26 mm focal length, 2.8" sensor size, 0.8¬µm pixel size) and on the rear, there\'s an 64+8+5+5 MP camera with features like 8 x Digital Zoom, Auto Flash, Face detection, Touch to focus. It is backed by a 6000 mAh battery. Connectivity features in the smartphone include WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Volte, and more.It is a good product to use. Best feature  is it touch,processor and camera with effective  rate\n\n', '\n\n  I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.Now coming to the phone :Pros :-1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)\n\n', "\n\n  I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked\n\n", "\n\n  The phone looks and feels good in the hand. All the gimmicks while setting up the phone would make one feel happy about buying the phone. Now let's get to the tall claims by Samsung basis which one has spent 17K.First of all I received a phone which when switched on went directly to system reboot mode. That was the first shock! The others are described next.Finger print reader is slow at times and one has to place the finger a couple of times to unlock the phone.Battery Life is lower than a 3000mah. Yes, one would get a longer battery life out of this phone if left unused and that is precisely what it hasn't been purchased for.Camera Quality is bad, very bad. The pictures are so grainy and pixelated. Had a Moto G4 plus before this and the picture quality from the camera was awesome.Feel cheated by Samsung for palming off such poor quality device for INR 17K. I want a refund.Amazon, I am aware that this review will go through a review by your team. Please take note and help initiate a return and refund so that I can buy a better device worth its value. Tganks!\n\n", "\n\n  Awesome  screen .Awesome battery  .Awesome  cameras .Specially  ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung  is superb. I used Samsung  Galaxy  alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being  back to Samsung ... it's  worth it .Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing  at this price . No one can beat it .Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .Just go for it .1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .\n\n", "\n\n  Battery is very poor. It is draining at a rate of 6% per hour. I didn't expect such a poor product from samsung. Moreover, while charging for even half n hour phone heated up. It restarted by it's own after following troubleshoot procedure also.\n\n", "\n\n  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls üôè don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....\n\n", '\n\n  \xa0Live focus Camera is too goodBattery is great which lasts for a day.Display is nice and Bigger great for watching video and playing games.Fingerprint scanner is little bit slow.Face detection also slow.But in 16 k it is value for money.\n\n', "\n\n  Pros:1. Display is good especially dark images or videos look great2. Really a monstrous battery3. Selfie camera is better4. Fingerprint sensor is fast5. OS is fluidic without any lag6. Call quality and reception is good7. No ads and the default Apps can be deletedNeutral:1. External speaker volume is decent but not great. Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the NokiasCons:1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.2.

As soon as i opened  the box i was disappointed  as there is no Screen protector or Mobile case available. Box has only mobile phone , type c cable and charger only. Phone was charged to 73%.Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.\n\n", "\n\n  Over heating issue and slow charging time 5 hours in full charge over slow .and proper not working in sensor..so pls don't pay ..waste your money\n\n", '\n\n  II am writing this with 4 months of usage.Issue1: Getting On-Hold automatically during calls.Issue2: Call recording also autmatically ON during calls even we dont need.Issue3: Sensors are very bad, not able to recognize call is going or not.Issue4: Camera stabilization is very bad, not able to take photo of scan docs perfectly, always it used to be blurred.Issue5: Charging time is more, even though they are telling 15w charge. My old phone get charged quickly rather than this.When i tried to reach customer care toll free, there is no response from them saying "Limited staff". Think before buying this model twice.\n\n', '\n\n  I have noticed below issues with phone.* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.Also battery drains out easily* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.\n\n', "\n\n  UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!======================================================================================Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after more than a month of usage:- The phone heats up during charging.- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(\n\n", '\n\n  This phone is great with battery backup and picture quality but within 8 days the phone got in bootloop as sson as I got a new update and I did it. This is not even starting now.\n\n', '\n\n  Its OS Software got crashed in first update build release and it happened to all the M31 devices\n\n', '\n\n  Hangs up in 2 months. Had to loose entire Data. Samsung service centres is always full with atleast 100 people in line. That speaks about the quality . Had similar experience in the past. Trusted Samsung for second time in vain. Never Buy Samsung Products. within 2 months touch not working and hangs up frequently.\n\n', "\n\n  \xa0The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.I purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.I have used the camera in the last 5 months. The results are very satisfactory. There may be some limitations in low light photography, but with a little tweaking, you get good results.\n\n", '\n\n  Dont buy samsung phones, Only gud for display clearity otherwise worst to but.Also cant return in amazon. within 2 days i tried to cantact amazon Customer service but cant reach them after reach them they said cant do return or replace so better go and buy any show rooms its better,\n\n', "\n\n  Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am üíØ percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,Display: good,Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,\n\n", '\n\n  Well I bought this phone after listening to all the appraisal its getting around.I bought a 6 GB Variant with 128 GB internal storage.The day it came it was fineWorking fineNow its.been about a month i have been using it..My Reviews for camera .... CAMERA QUALITY IS JUST FINE but the features given like AR DOODLE etc are amazing...BATTERY LIFE IS ABOUT 1 AND A HALF DAY of normal usageGestures are amazingPROCESSOR is kinda slow which leads to lagging sometimes especially when using AR Doodle and Of course during PUBG ..

But the fingerprint reader asks for so many attempts.Major issue with this phone is that it keeps restarting for no reason. That too 3 to 4 times a day !Intially I thought it needs an update and might work fine after that but that didn't work too.It's not very pleasing when it restarts in the middle of some important work you trying to finish.I have been using this phone for a month now but it has not been working upto my expectations.Sorry but not happy with my purchase.\n\n", '\n\n  Editing the review since camera results are very poor.

Thanks to Amazon. But once I opened the packet, the box was sealed, but the phone looked to be used already like may be for 1-2 days. There was a little scratch on the side of the phone, many applications weren‚Äôt working properly on the phone (ex: YouTube, Spotify), but eventually YouTube was fine but Spotify still has problem. I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person‚Äôs voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn‚Äôt show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don‚Äôt have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand. It may stop working any time.Poor experience with amazon as well as the Samsung galaxy m31.I don‚Äôt even want to keep this phone, It gave me that bad experience in just 2 days of using it. But amazon is not supporting at all.\n\n', '\n\n  Most disgusting service from Amazon & Samsung ever. Received a defected Mobile which had issues with its touchscreen. Replacing the phone is such a pain in the wrong place. First they ask you to download a stupid app to run testing which takes incorrect tests. I have problem with my touchscreen & they test the fingerprint sensor & give a result stating that all is good. Secondly I cannot contact any customer care agent as no one is available at this point of time. Customers are left to fend for themselves. "Atmanirbhar" is taken to a whole new level by Amazon!!! Utterly DisgustingPlease sort this out Amazon before your customers shift to other online apps.Samsung, Where has your quality gone? Do you only focus on expensive phones? One Plus & other brands have already started eating up your market share.. please act wisely if you don\'t want to share your fate with Nokia.\n\n', "\n\n  The mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.\n\n", '\n\n  Received my Samsung Galaxy M31 on 7th Mar. It cost me 15,999 rupees.Literally shocked to see the Indian sim card only labeled on box.Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic. They said they cannot write everything about product.Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.\n\n', '\n\n  Bought this phone.  Received in time.  delivery is good.  Product is very very bad.  Plan to exchange it even for china mobiles.  I bought this mobile as my friend is happily using M30 for 2yrs.  I thought M 31 will be better than M30.1.  Audio quality is very very bad -  Not able to hear even when speaker is on with max volume and all equalizer settings.  All possible solutions available on line were tried in vain.2.  Frequently hangs even for a simple task like calling!  Then we have to press the power key to switch off and switch on -  this happened 4-5 times in 10 daysI dont feel like using a new mobile.  Not worth for 20,000.  I am planning to exchange it.\n\n', "\n\n  Totally flop phone,worst experience of my life to buy this mobile.After 15 days of purchase camera fail,always hanging problem.Now service center tell mother board and camera of this phone require to change.I feel cheated,I don't no whom to blame-AMAZON/SELLER/SAMSUNG.But my suggestion is never brought this M31.After spending a huge amount now I am running towards SERVICE CENTRE and there is a huge waiting during this pandemic and as usual server problems.Now today my phone is submitted and may be in 3-5days its problem solved.\n\n", "\n\n  I ordered the phone on June 1, which was delivered on June 5. I tried to start the phone. It didn't. I put it in the charger. No light. Nothing. Phone was completely dead. Same day I tried to put request Amazon replace/ refund section. Now here comes the worst part. It does not allow you to refund/ replace. Rather, it asks you to talk to customer service. However, there is no one in customer service to answer your phone. I tried to call directly at Amazon 1800 number. It does not connect.\n\n", "\n\n  Phone is good. Value for money, but sound quality is not good.

After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre-installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re pre-installed, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.\n\n", "\n\n  I bought 2 phones 10 days back. Biggest problem is from day 1, in both mobiles every now and then signal drops completely and I need to restart the phone to get signal back.

I did all that was suggested by samsung but nothing worked. Now I have to waste time going to service center.Another shocking fact is non of the reviews have pointed this problem where on the internet there are many people affected.If this is not sorted, I will sue samsung!\n\n", '\n\n  Operating and dispaly is not goodNot user friendlyNot as per expexted quality\n\n', "\n\n  Worst phone ever i purchased in my life.

It does not even last for a single day with moderate usage i.e. surfing with wifi connectivity (no gaming or watching videos).3. 64 mega pixel camera is another gimmick. No detailing is there. Capture is very much grainy. Pixel is also visible.4. Build quality is just not bearable. It gives feel similar to 7-8k phone. Cheap plastic is used in the back.5. Charging time is horrible.

Hence, decided to upgrade my mother's phone as well and Samsung M series being Proudly Made in India and a non Chinese but a Korean brand, ordered the M31 128GB.To my surprise, I was even more amazed when the phone arrived. Everything the M21 was best at, was carried over and the Camera performance was even more improved in every aspect.The sharpness, AF, colours, and also video performance was improved over M21 which itself is good.No wonder the phone is selling like hot cakes all over India. My only regret now is, I didnt knew the M31s was launching. Else I would have waited for the M31s which going by the reviews, is a monster in Camera segment.Anyway, since my moms and dads phones have been set and purchased already, I think I need a phone upgrade for myself and it sure will be a Samsung. Probably the upcoming A71S 5G or an A51s 5G since i have read up about the about to be released Samsung phones.\n\n", '\n\n  1.

Took so long for charging.\n\n', '\n\n  Very bad phone, not worth it. Even Amazon refused to to do the replacement. Feeling cheated by amazon. Next time no purchase any expensive item from Amazon.\n\n', "\n\n  Don't buy. Not worth 15k. Worst camera. Phone is getting warm for normal usage(not even playing games). You cannot return this after buying. Amazon will tell stories instead of refunding.Amazon technician is not visiting on time and it's very frustrating after paying 15 k for this nonsense piece. Farid amazon.\n\n", '\n\n  I ordered this phone first time it came with a number of issues like overheating and damaged product. Second time when they replaced they again gave me a phone with poor battery performance which does not even lasts upto 12hrs.With similar usuage with other persons known to us it is lasting upto 24 hrs plus. We have deliberated checked this issue. Overall a unsatisfactory experience.\n\n', "\n\n  1. Camera is not up to the expectation2.

Samsung's Super AMOLED Screen2. Massive 6000 mAh battery3. 64 MP Quad Camera4. One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box5. Dolby Atmos SupportCons:1. Exynos 9611 is fair enough to handle the daily work but it's a little old processor, it would be better if it would come with any of the latest ones.2. Fingerprint sensor is adequately fast but it's a capacitive and back mounted. It would be better if it would have in display one.3. The phone has a massive 6000 mAh battery and it supports fast charging only upto 15 watt. It would be better if would support 25 watt because it takes quite a time to charge the battery fully.N.B.

You will need to go to YouTube for gaming reviews.\n\n", '\n\n  Not worth it when you compare it with Xiaomi phonesIssues--Heavier than MI phones--Screenshot is not by scrolling  3 fingers as in MI phones. You need to press power button and volume button simultaneously--screen mirroring is very poor does not works-- Camera is also poor than MI phones-- while opening web link gives only one option to open using Samsung Browser.-- many other usability issues.--overall you will feel going back to MI due to issues in usability\n\n', "\n\n  Good phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good. But looks wise the company could do better using glass or metal.Fingerprint reader is accurate and so is face recognition.Battery is powerful and long lasting. Keeps you going all day!Camera quality is awesome and comes with many cool features also! Pictures and videos are sharp and true to their color and high quality.Overall, it comes with many features and the brand Samsung adds to the value and trustworthiness of this phone!! Using it for three months now. Smooth and perfect.PA: no proper cover available. I wish samsung provided it.even if for extra cost with high quality for protection.Couldn't find any till date. Help me if someone has recommendations.:(\n\n", '\n\n  Let‚Äôs start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera ReviewThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.Galaxy M31That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security ReviewGalaxy M31The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance ReviewGalaxy M31The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company‚Äôs custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.\n\n', "\n\n  I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone10. Night mode photos are stunning. The first photo given above is of Hyderabad nightline, taken from my balcony.11. Next two photos are of clouds taken from an Indigo flight.12. Next snap is of cardamom flowers in my garden.13. The last one is pav baked by me at home. Snap taken with Food Mode. I found in food mode pictures coming alive.I especially impressed with night mode and food .Ode photos. They are si.ply superb.\n\n", '\n\n  Phones battery life is good but it gets heated for example when you are on call for a long time for while booking cabs when location is on it takes a lot of battery No pop up notifications in WhatsApp phone needs work in accessibility I am a low vision person the phones keyboard gets too much expanded when using zoom gesture making it impossible to type I have to reboot the whole phone to get the keyboard to its normal size . Select to speak options hangs frequently and the phone becomes unaccessible.after my purchase there was a software update due to which my screen gets zoom automatically creating problem while using which is very irritating face recognition is not that good phone takes two and a half hour to charge completely.Camera is really nice beautiful pictures come out.\n\n', '\n\n  Missing app lock and secure folder, I hope software update will fix it in future.Headphone is missing üò©.Downloaded s secure from galaxy store for App lock.Removed unnecessary preloaded apps.Add restrictions for background data if you want to save data and battery.Great Camera tested in all moods(check in pictures).Night mood is superb.Anyone posting bad reviews about camera is personal intentions.Freefire or pubg consums 6% battery per hour. But remember it depends on your network speed.Fast charging is working perfectly,Still moving my apps from old galaxy J7 Pro, I will update my review after 1 month.Nice phone.\n\n', "\n\n  Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.\n\n", "\n\n  First time I plugged in for charging. Phone displayed recovery mode screen though I haven't pressed any button. Totally disappointed by this experience.I have requested to return this item and refund me entire amount but amazon policy relaxed upto replacement.Bad experience.Display and look wise phone looks stunning but still I haven't used it so system performance might be well as expected. I hope so.Waiting for brand new replacement of M31. I hope it would work well\n\n", '\n\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 gives you a very high value for the price. Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.At this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example -  AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone\n\n', "\n\n  Camera(VIDEO STABILIZATION dosent work) , battery are good . Phone heats up a little bit but that heating is acceptable .Screen is not as good as Nokia screens and others (IPS LCD ) , IPS LCD would have given a better performance .Screen doesn't give Natural colours.Performance is good . Fingerprint sensor is awsome , it works very Smoothly .The software has better options .Mirror link is not supported by this mobile . If they had provided Mirror screen option then it would have been great ,no 3rd party app supports mirror link .Charging cable is too short .Camera is not as good as Nokia 8.1 ,6 .If the mobile gets IPS LCD SCREEN , SONY IMX CAMERA then the mobile would be so awesome\n\n", "\n\n  Updates after couple of weeks of usage!!‚Äê----‚Äê--‚Äê---------‚Äê-----Stay away from this! Biometrics is a joke! Never ever again will choose a Samsung product for mobile!Updates after couple of days usage...1. Battery power seems to be good!2. Fast charging is a let down!3. Finger print sensor doesn't work most of the times and required constant cleaning!! I would rather use face lock!!4. Memory (6GB) is not performing well. Recommend to go for 8GB.=====================================With lot of excitement, i bought this phone and to my disappointment it is an utter flop! Phone heated up like anything which i was setting it up and I could immediately feel that the phone had problems. May be for 16K this is what you get?? But might disappointed as I have used other low cost phones and have never faced such problems. Now, I thought Samsung as a brand was good, but I realized that it is not about the brand name always. Stay away from this model,5 star for shipping and delivery.

Guesture screenshot didn\'t work.5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.6. OS is so smooth.7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.Update: after multiple days of regular use1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,2. Though it\'s of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement4. Call quality isn\'t that great5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.Verdict: Go with this mobile if you\'re expecting a good rear camera and better battery performance.\n\n', '\n\n  Guys don\'t become a fool and buy this phoneThe phone will start hanging and will switch off in between a call. Touch will not work , you have to end up pressing the touch multiple times to accept end calls or to do any work on phone.Battery life is ok okPhones started hanging in just 2 daysAnd more painful is that Amazon does not have return policy for this. They will send some technician to check it and "if " he finds issue phone will be replaced.If I would have known this I would never have purchased it from here.Now only god knows how my problem will be solved. I have came across such issue 1st time ever as I always preferred to buy such electronic items from physical store or not to go for any random low budget phone to avoid any complexity.Rethink before buying this phone from amazon ( if u faced any difficulty they won\'t return or refund the amount)\n\n', '\n\n  After using for 5 days here r my observationsDisplay-crisp n top notchBrightness-excellentBuild-plastics but sturdyProcessing- no lags or whatsoever.

After using the phone for one week I am writing down the reviews.

I don't like the phone too much,as it has samsung branding so I expect more but at this price many phone available better than this but it's battery backup & display quality is best.

Best for old generation people.\n\n", '\n\n  Decided to buy samsung phone after using all known chinese brands like vivo,oppo etc in last 5 years. But after using for 15 days realized why samsung lost market share rapidly to the chinese players. The phone has the same issues tht samsung used to have 5 years back like getting changed,features like adaptive brightness doesnt work and pictures with 64 megapixel camera  leaves white patches on the face.phone has a lag and not fast .samsung seriously needs to review its product quality otherwise customers will surely dump it and go for Chinese brands\n\n', "\n\n  Very good product. I read about the concerns on the camera but still decided to go ahead. The mobile is fantastic. Camera, OS everything is good. This was my first online purchase of this value and had concerns there. But was delighted as everything went smooth. There was a delivery OTP provided by Amazon hence the delivery person had to deliver to me in person which was good. I was worried that he shouldn't leave it with security in my absence. 2nd, the seller had packed it nicely, the primary pack seal by the manufacturer was intact hence a genuine new pack.

I was Iphone user and seriously I purchased this phone to get more handy with android OS.Camera: Too good. Many options and works in almost all condition.Sound: Dolby supports to Bluetooth and wired headphones. AmazingDisplay: No competition.. sAMOLED is doing its best. The contrast is such black even you cant make difference between the body black color and the screen black color. Phone looks very nice when I use dark mode.Battery: Monster battery, full usage will give you 1 and half day life. if average use then it will last for 2 days.Charging Cable: it is only 0.5 Meter, Samsung why why are you giving such small length wire? how much are you saving 50 INR? Also i found the charging cable is with poor quality.No Case: Generally silicon case we get by 150 INR outside, samsung would have given it then it was good. but its not there in box.Overall this product is superb choise if you have budget under 20K (for this variant of 8GB RAM 128 GN Storage)\n\n', "\n\n  It's really good device. Battery is a freaking beast, amoled display is beautiful and UI is very slick and simple. I got nothing to complaint considering what I paid for it.

Big display--good display--but not HDR enabled though Vivid color setting does a pretty good job. I am not the Cheapo kind who takes selfies and uses a lot of Tik Tok so camera is not a big deal for me But the camera  is real good HDR pics are nice and slow mo and time lapse are amazing. Live focus is a amazing feature in camera. Sound quality is awesome and better than redmi note 6 pro which i was using earlier. Good snappy phone for daily app usage. I don't waste my time on games so no comments. UI is good with ease of use all around. Love the AOD display.Bought a sandisk type C usb otg but it didnt show in storage.

Samsung and its screen are the best thing to have. There is some bezel in the screen and I didn't like the idea of curving screen at the corners. It is manageable though.3. Touch and keypad are good and responsive.Cons1. Processor on the slower side. Good for its category but definitely not the best.2. I didn't like the build quality of the phone.  While the shape is sharp and finish is good, I find the phone little bit bulky.3. The menu and options are not the most user friendly. I used an Oxygen os before and believe me it was much smooth in sorting things.\n\n", '\n\n  worthless phone excessive heating the phone heats up like iron. the radiations level of the phone are above standard planning to launch a complaint against Samsung under product liability 2019 and cpa 1986....Amazon for supporting this kind of crappy product for sale.... you all the dealer Samsung and importer who is also liable for not declaring information required under law....\n\n', "\n\n  Camera: 3.8/5Battery: 5/5UI: 5/5Fingerprint reader: 4/5Screen: 5/5The first and foremost reason to buy it is that its not a China brand.

After raise issue to Mi CS atleast they refunded my Rs. 524.Now, about M31 if you looking for decent phone with Amoled screen and bigger battery this the phone for you.For some people not having glass body may feel like a deal breaker but for me whi has used a glass body phone with back cover doesn't feel like much difference, phone is 90% of time in back cover.Camera id descent for thus price range, won't  say the best but gives satisfactory results and quad camera setup many more options to play with.Samsung needs to upgrade from 9611 processor but still for a user like me it doesn't  make any difference.Any body looking to buy a new phone can wait and buy M31s which has a better charging and screen.\n\n", "\n\n  This review is for users who mostly use mobile for calls, watching videos, some social media and photography!!Looks: This phone is Huge! For watching videos it is fun but handling it can be tricky... Plastic back is fingerprint magnet so cover is recommended.Screen: stunner! Big screen + amoled is great combination! Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.Always on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.Battery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.Few hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays)I am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.Charging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%(Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.)Performance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.Camera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.Attached some sample shots.Macro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.Wide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.Selfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.Video recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!Summary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt. Had to uninstall it manually)\n\n", "\n\n  2 STAR TO 4 STARDEAR ALLIM writing the review after usage of Samsang M31 after one month. The below review was written after 2-3 days of usage of same. But after 1 month I chage my mind and believe it's one of good phone cader. Not bad as wat I have written below( my early review)Battery back up is too good and performance wise to its a MONSTER. Camera too good. The only area in which the phone lage is loud speaker. That they have to improve.üëçüëçüëçüëçü§≥Thx allMy early reviewüëáVery much Disappointed  with the product M31 I was previously  using MI A2. I bought this after so much research from review from Amazon.  The major disappointment was with speakers both loud speakers & phone speakers  quality  is not at all acceptable. Very cheap sounds never ever I used it before in my entire life time.I play free fire ( only game I have in my mobile)In MIA2 (6GB Ram ,128 storage ) I never got up hang my mobile. But in case of M31 (8GB RAM 128 STORAGE) I got hang every time ü§£ü§£ü§£If you have other options plz go for it. I will never come back to Samsung in my life time.I hesitate to go for redmi before I  buy MiA2. This time too I thought to for Mi. Still gone for Samsung. But it proved me wrong.\n\n", "\n\n  Hello All..I'm writing this review after few months of usage, but this should not be different as per my experience. I feel this instrument is having all necessary features in this price range for those who believe in smart work and nice user interface.I liked the most..- Android 10! Latest looks & works Beautiful...ahead of all- One UI is the superb experience as compared to other ones which are cheap. Feel the REAL look and damn useful features required for what is called as SMART WORK- Dark Mode is the best feature I wish for- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging.- 6000 mh battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support VoLTE...i really appreciate this- The Mobile Mic and speaker is good and clear- Camera is really good.  Video stabilization option is excellent- Face unlock, figure-print sensor response is quickAdditional requirement- I wish Samsung should provide a screen guard and back cover along with the handset. This is very good business trend and customer convenience. This will also help to protect the instrument from Day1 of usage.Finally the icing on the cake is..If you are thinking to buy a new phone, you can always consider this on priority being proudly Made In India. The day is not so away...MONSTER will surely beat the DRAGON\n\n", "\n\n  Using this mobile for  almost 2 months now. Just before lockdown i bought it and it started hanging within a week so i wasn't able to place an exchange or return order complaint. The battery life is also very less as compared to other mobile phones I've used. Plus it mentions 6000mah which it definitely not at all acceptable. Also it starts to heat up pretty quickly and then you'll not be able to use your phone for another 30 mins. Not at all satisfied with the product.\n\n", '\n\n  Many people have written a lot about this phone. So let me give you my quick observation:1. Screen is good, but has yellow tint. People used to super bright screens will not like it.2. The max brightness is also not as much as other good quality phones.3. Battery life is ok at best. But that is because of Samsung os. You can enable it to kill more apps to preserve battery.4. Samsung one os is ok ok. Lacks many things in 2020! Scrollable wallpapers missing on home screen. Sms and calling app look outdated. App launcher is also ok ok. No issues have installed nova launcher. Can also recommend lawnchair.5. Sar value is low, so range is not max always. Some basic issues with wifi tooHope samsung will fix color tint issue and other os issues.So at almost 20k not worth it. But hey I bought it because it is not a Chinese phone. So extra money spent on nationalism. Jai Hind!\n\n', '\n\n  Worst ever phone any one can buy ...really shameful that these type of third grade products are being sold on Amazon. I ordered a Samsung phone on 14th March it was defective so a replacement was sought on 20 th march but due to lockdown andreturn pickups not happening it could not happen finally Amazon person came in JUNE but refused to replace it as its outer cover was not there I pleaded but he refused to budge I was left with a defective piece so went to service center my phones camera ,Jack, battery have been replaced but still issues are there , a brand new phone turned out to be a dud...really shocking even now battery drains too quickly...in this price range many phones are available please dont go for it ..worst ever purchase with zero service from both amazon and samsung .P.s - there service  center will keep on saying that no parts are available and will keep your phone for around a week. So have another phone ready with you as you will need it.My honest advice dont buy this phone.\n\n', '\n\n  This phone is a winner. Absolutely stunning camera @64 MP. Excellent battery life, still running after extensive excitement use by my daughter. Biometric scans both face and fingerprint work well. Video quality is excellentAwesome cost.The only drawback Galaxy store works well, the play store doesn‚Äôt.\n\n', '\n\n  \xa0I feel to stop buying products from amazon & I decided never to buy any Samsung mobile( View the Video I\'ve attached )Just used the mobile for 15 days facing so many issues, this is the worst phone I ever used in my life. This mobile deserves all negative feedback.M31 Mega Fraud, Mega Useless & Mega Waste of Money.I\'LL BE THANKFUL TO AMAZON IF THEY REFUND MY MONEY OR REPLACE THIS USELESS MOBILE.Note:- I gave 1 star just because of amazon\'s marketing trick, they not allowing to proceed the feedback with Zero star rating.

When I opened the box and was trying to charge the phone adapter was not working. 2nd day I went to service centre and they replaced the adapter. Battery is drying fast while it is 6000 mah. I thought there is some issue with the new phone but due to lockdown I did not went to service centre for battery problem. I am facing issue every time sometime it is restarting suddenly, due to lockdown will Amazon exchange my phone with the new one or Service Centre will replace my phone. I do not want this phone it will create lots of technical problem in future. So please replace the phone.\n\n', "\n\n  So now after using for 5 days i feel this phone is amazing.Pros:1.Superb amoled screen is just amazing , i have used iphone , motorola and vivo high end phones but this screen looks great.2.Battery:I used this phone continuosly 12 hours with huge gaming and watching videos ,using social media and lot but still battery was more than 50% . I love this battery it's super amazing.3.Camera : Its a high end camera with amazing features . The quality is wow. Super crystal clear images . If you like photography its a good phone at this price . Why go for some chinese spy phones?4.Completely made and manufactured in india.Cons:1. No cover ,No screenguard,No earphones inside box. Samsung should think about it.2.Samsung should change UI little or atleast provide stock android which is best option.Note:Guys i got a notification from samsung galaxy app to buy smart care protection+screen protection would recommend to buy this which i purchased for 699 .Its complete protection for phone and screen .Lets see what kind of service they provide in future.\n\n", '\n\n  I bought the mobile in the first day of its release and writing this review after almost 3 months.For a normal user without gaming and all..,Pros:1.  Good battery backup2.  Good display and hence we can watch movies and series also in this.Cons:1. Very dangeruos to use without screen guard or case. Display got broke on the second day and when I went to Samsung service centre.., they said the charge for changing display is Rs. 5500. which is very costly.2.  Cant use it in one hand and the sensitivity is so high that even before pressing BACK button.., when typing something automatically that gets executed and it goes to a different screen. We get irritated all the time that happens3. Face unlock is not up to the mark.In a sentence, I am not a satisfied customer because of the above issues.\n\n', '\n\n  Dont comes with headphone,back case cover. Battery is not good enough,only if you dont use internet then only it goes correctly. But i have nokia smartphone which offers 3500mah battery, which runs pubg smoothly and last battery for one and half day. Love for nokia , hate for samsung.\n\n', '\n\n  I had been waiting to buy this smartphone since its launch. It has been a couple of days using it and I am very satisfied with the experience. The fingerprint reader unlocks the phone in a jiffy. The battery lasted over a day with moderate to high usage, including surfing, watching YouTube videos, using Spotify and making two long calls. It took me 2 hours to charge the phone from 20 to 100%, which is decent considering that the charger is a 15W one. The camera quality is really good, and although I have only taken photos of my answer scripts so far, I am looking forward to taking more photos with it. The processor is also great and it has been able to handle moderate levels of multitasking with ease. The display is bright and vibrant, and the sound quality is really good. Overall, it checks all the boxes, and makes it a true tool for the user.I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a decent budget phone. In this range it is definitely the mega monster that it claims to be.\n\n', '\n\n  Phone is never getting fully charge.fast charging is not working.after charging for 3 hours it reached from 10% to 50%.I think i got wrong charger and no where written on the charger that it is 15w charger.also battery performance is very poor.it is getting discharge very fast ,Also phone performance is very slow...\n\n', '\n\n  Charging time of phone is more than 5-6 hours. But battery drains like a normal 3000 mah one. Nothing monster about it. And amazon support is worst, they are not returning the phone even within 4 days of purchase. Samsung customer care executives are telling me to come to service centre, why did I buy a phone if I had to go to service centre with 4 day of purchase.  Phone hangs even if you use Instagram for 30 min. Bad processor.\n\n', "\n\n  This is a short review after the first 24 hours of the M31 6GB 128GB black color phone I have bought. I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks  (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone,  buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly.  This is huge.So should you buy M31? Unless you are a high end gamer the answer is YES.\n\n", '\n\n  I am using Samsung Galaxy M31 last 10 days. I feel I made best choice this time.1. Android v10.0 OS with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor really good performance. No lagging.2. Excellent Display. Blue ligth filter is cool.3. 6000 mah battery is very usefull for continuous user like me. Fast charging & no heating problem.4. Camera is good. Macro performance is very good. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.5. Both dedicated sim slots support LTE.6. Mobile speakers sound is good but when I use earphone I am not getting full clarity.7. Finger print sensor response is compartively very good.8. When I ordered phone I was thinking it is big size but it is very handy..!9. Storage expandable upto 512GB is really usefull.I feel phone is really worth for the price & you may like to use it. Without doubt you may order.\n\n', '\n\n  Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.\n\n', "\n\n  Phone has a .massive battery as stated by Samsung 6000mah capacity.  But trust me it's useless. Battery backup in average moderate usage will not last even a complete full day by the end of the your battery percentage will be around 15 to 20. Which is really disappointing.  Trust me my honor 8x mobile with just 3450 mah battery gives a similar back up. What is the point of buying such a phone then. Camera is good. Low light capture is efficient enough at this price range. Finger print sensor is okay. Not great as my honor 8x has a lightning fast finger 3sensor when compared to Samsung. Also I found a sense of lag in the UI when going through the phone like pressing the back button for returning etc.  Samsung need to fix the bug for battery drain its drains like crazy. Disappointed with the battery.\n\n", "\n\n  A nice phone for Rs 16000. It also manages tonplay asphalt 9 on highest graphics settings. Yes i did face a bit of heating issue. To solve it, update the firmware to latest version, Reduce brightness to minimum , turn on battery saver and turn on dark mode. It wiil solve most of the heating problem. U would still get a little heat while steaming youtube video, whatsapp video call or playing games or doing a phone call for some time or simply charging the phone but that's quite normal for any android phone\n\n", "\n\n  Bought this product when launched at its lowest price, had to wait quiet long for the product after intense surveying because I was avoiding high end phones because life of each phone is nearly same, and during the pandemic it was of utmost importance to save each penny instead of spending freely and also wanted to avoid phones manufactured by China.I had decided to buy a phone within 20K and this phone gave me all features which are in top end phones(30K-40K), off course there is difference in the quality.1.Camera picture quality- Though it has nice cameras(number wise e.g 64MP,32MP) clarity of picture is not so good,but worth it in this price range.2.Battery- 6000 mAh it says but it isn't actually its 5825 mAH and I use a third party battery application called accu battery which is especially for battery its charging speed,health,discharging,sleep time etc. and it shows around 5400 mAH, so can't be sure of battery, though they have got a certification regarding this but am not sure.3.RAM- I have 8GB ram version and its worth it in this price range. Sometimes it lags but that is acceptable.4.Internal memory- 128GB its satisfactory, what is even better that it has a dedicated slot for memory card and since  had onnem my previous device I was happy in it.Overall speaking it is a good range phone, especially it is MADE IN INDIA, of a South Korean company.\n\n", "\n\n  An average phone with decent features that are usually available with any Samsung Mobile.What i didn't like -1. High battery charging time of over 2hrs for 100%2. Phone heats up quite quickly. Upgraded OS and right on day 1, it got heated up during the upgrade3. Poor quality camera - but can't expect more from a 18k mobile4. Large and bulky - poor design- again, can't expect more at that price5. Performance isn't greatOnly good things1. Display - good for that price and size2. It is Samsung!What am I comparing with? Oppo, Poco & Samsung A series.Have always been using Flagship mobiles and this one was just a secondary mobile for home, yet it is not quite exciting.\n\n", "\n\n  Editing after using few days. Don't trust samsung. I have used so far 2 models. All flop.Lot many issues in this model - Camera shots coming blank.Bluetooth not working smoothly. Its braking in just 2 mtr away speaker. Other phone I had it was super fantastic iPhone old though. It was working if its 10mtrs also.Facebook watch videos flickering. Need to close all n open again to view from scratch.Buggy and  bulky model.Dislike same old UI icons. Bulky design like old mobiles. Camera is fantastic. Got screen glitch while playing preinstalled games. That shows some issue in software.Also Samsung fircebly adding few unneccessary games app in build which is not needed. Not able to figure out how to stop those popup alerts.\n\n", '\n\n  Almost every call gets dropped after 20 to 30 seconds. On same SIM , other phones are working fine. So , its device problem.Expected more on other side but not up to expectations. Over all rating a B- if calls drop issue is resolved, else its worthless.\n\n', '\n\n  After using the phone for 3 months, i am writing this review.Pros:- Battery backup- Dual 4G Dual WiFi calling- High Quality LED Display- Camera in HDR mode- Sleek design- SpeedCons:- initially had restarting issues, later resolved after software update- Heats up on long video calls and battery drains fast due to high quality video- Camera could have been better, zooms in digital mode, not optical- Security lock function for each app not availableOverall an excellent phone at this price range with an excellent battery backup. You cannot expect a DSLR clarity for this price even if you have a 128 pixel in Digital zoom.If you are willing to buy only for a high quality camera, not a good choice. I have attached some shots, you can have a look and decide. Otherwise i am happy with my purchase 6 GB RAM & 128 GB Storage with a pretty good speed of operations.Mangal S\n\n', "\n\n  Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .Pros :1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 17K .2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs . The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .Cons :1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.\n\n", "\n\n  I chose to purchase this because of two things : The display, having already used the M30. And, the humongous 6000mAH Battery.As for the battery, I have received something even better. The m31 display is an upgrade over the M30. I don't know if I am wrong, but it is more crisp and has better contrast.But however I am disappointed with the battery. Even though it is 1000 mAh higher capacity, I have not noticed any significant difference over M30.But this is again compensated by a far better camera than the M30. The M30 camera was pathetic to say the least.This is however not as good as a realme or redmi. But, the display is light years better than the realmes or mis.\n\n", '\n\n  1. Price:The price for which the smartphone is available is much more affordable and more featureful than any other competitors.2. Battery:The battery really supprts the tagline monster battery which really helps the phone to last atleast 2 days of battery backup.3. Specifications :The price bracket for the smartphone offered the specs is more powerful than the others.4. Product Quality:The sturdiness of smartphone is really good and the case provided in the box really helps the phone to be more safe.5. Camera:The camera offers quad camera setup which is also more brighter in night and ultra wide features help me get all in one frame, and quality is also really very good.Overall Screen, Specifications, Build Quality is remarkable made by Samsung.\n\n', "\n\n  ProsAmazing display quality.Top notch clarity on Amazon Prime on par with OnePlus kind of phones.Camera quality is great in 64pixel mode back cam and 32 pixel mode front cam. Macro shot, food shot are good. Live bokeh on back cam is ok and front cam live bokeh will disappoint.Battery backup is definitely better than a 3000 to 4000 mAh with snapdragon SOC.General processing, speed and animations are seamless.if you are a fan of Samsung ui you would love it.Finger print sensor is good as the best ones , it's fast enough.ConsAudio quality with a Sony Bass headset is not so great, frequencies and noise cancellation is not soothing, cannot match a Nokia 6 Dolby, if you are music lover, this phone will disappoint you. Yet sound with a Bluetooth speaker was good. Surround effects on Dolby mode are good but audio quality needs some work.I am not a fan of custom ui and someone used to the stock android & miss it, still can manage with launchers like Nova to get the stock android feel.Has a lot of Samsung and third party apps which you have to disable. Some cannot be disabled as well. Of the 6GB, 1.5 GB is wasted on these apps. So you practically have only 3gb left after the OS and Samsung apps, which is not expected of 6gb ram device. A stock android phone will offer more RAM and processing power in reality, with the same hardware.Exynos is worthy for normal use and I am not sure about gaming as I have not tried.Extra memory and battery are in place because of the bloatware the phone ships in. These are not annoying like the ones on Micromax or cheaper phones. Most of these genuine ones, but one may not use them.Larger battery makes the phone heavier, plastic body gives a false feel like the phone is not sturdy, the phone actually is pretty solid, if you have a case and glass you don't find a difference.Over all a worthy smartphone and worth its money.\n\n", "\n\n  With all the chinese non-chinese phones thing going on, I decided to go for SAMSUNG which is made in India and it sure has disappointed me.‚úò Phones charging port has started acting up within 2 months. It's charging intermittently.‚úò Have not exposed the phone to bad weather or anything. The person using this has been at home during these times‚úò Tried different cable, plugpoint, charger, etc. Nothing seems to work.

I got this mobile in the exchange for my old Redmi Note 3. So, for me value buying.But, if you see, in this pandemic situation (COVID19) and geopolitical scenario, when India is planning to ban Chinese Products, Samsung has a great opportunity to acquire Indian Market and can deliver flagship mobiles by reducing the price.Pros:1. Display2. Battery backup3. Wide-angle camera pictures4. Dolby Atmos is a good experienceCons: 1. BUILTIN QUALITY (made up of plastic) -->> could be metal built2. As per the price range, PROCESSOR CAN BE IMPROVED.3. AGGRESSIVE PRICING4. The back should be glass5. Camera performance can be improved in low light condition#ChinaKoJawaab #wallet_power\n\n", "\n\n  Its been 10 days since i have started using the phone. There are certain things i'd like to mention.Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy. We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.\n\n", "\n\n  Phone is ok.Battery is good enough, this is the only plus point.Face detection does not work very poor,OTG is very good, Doc. Files transferred open directly without going through any app.Keyboard features not good in comparison to Google.Camera quality is very bad, white light turns blue, good pictures turn out very deep coloured.Palm screen shot does not work so the time.Adaptive screen doesn't work.Phone is slow.Power on off is missing.Plastic back cover gets scratched very fast.Videos plays in 2 steps, one in off volume.Samsung phones are not good for gear S2 watches, it connects through Samsung galaxy store which which does not show all the faces as In other phones & it also does not show the purchased watch faces.There is a feature of Zip apps, which is of no use bcoz if you zip an app you can't use it, so what's the purpose of zipping? And after unzipping apps get lost.Photo editor is not good enough,,,\n\n", '\n\n  This is a all rounder -1. Battery life is good, Though it would have made a little more sense if they had provided a better wattage charger then 15W. Plus side the battery life would last longer so.2. Camera quality is good. Though some reviews say not up to the mark - as the issue is there a separate option to use 4:3 64 MP which needs to be selected. Out of the box the default settings is 4:3 16 MP. This should help differentiate. This is in a way ok as 64 MP will use a lot of space for each picture as the size ratio is high.3. Display is the best as always.4. RAM any thing from 4 GB works well - Moderate use not talking about heavy gaming.5. Overall happy with the product and price is the best for such spec.\n\n', "\n\n  Awesome Phone... No problem at all.... Simply mind blowing.... I would like to appreciate more that customer care executive to whom i talked the very first time.

It's a humble request from my end.\n\n", "\n\n  From my experience of using M31 for the past one month-Pros:It is one of the best smartphones in this price range.Battery life is superb and also not heavy even if it's 6000 mah.As usual display is the best part of samsung phone.Cons:Design is not cool. Better use back cover.Don't expect much for camera, its just average only.Not at all a gaming phone, ita processor is not fast and the phone could not provide high frame rate.Can play pubg smoothly with medium frame rate and low graphics.\n\n", '\n\n  I have a good working phone -samsung A8 plus.. still purchased this phone as I  was excited with its features of 64 MP camera and 6000 mAmp battery-- both these features are a huge disappointment in this phoneno differnce from A8+ - or even worseno back cover/screen guard; purchased them online, before they come and start using this phone -return window expired..No fast charging as claimed, infact very very slow charging.......atleast no heating issues like other cheaper brandsscreen, touch sensitivity, fast processor -- are goodsound is again a disappointmentslow motion video and live focus on both cameras, both sim Volte enabling  - are the good features\n\n', "\n\n  YOU SHOULD KNOW WHY THIS IS SUPER MONSTER. MUST-READ.Samsung has literally poured premium qualities in this phone.1)CAMERA - Quad Camera rich quality photos. Even after Zoom, details are very clear & No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear & stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent & reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality & long-lasting capacity).3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick & so far no single glitch.4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass.

That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience & to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance & during multitasking & Gameplay.8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings.

The fingerprint reader is quick to respond and has no delay in unlocking the phone.  The camera is the highlight of this phone which allows users to capture splendid pictures (64MP) I myself have clicked numerous  pictures and haven't  faced any issues with the camera. The battery  life of this phone is more than adequate  for daily usage as well as gaming(performs well while running heavy games also). I'm extremely  pleased with the product and would recommend  this phone to anyone  looking for a smooth and hassle free experience.\n\n", "\n\n  I ordered the phone on 5th March'20 and got on 8th March'20 as promised by Amazon I had been using this phone for past 3 days. Kindly find my review below.Pros:Amazing battery. Single charge for 2 days minimum.Screen clarity is good. SAMOLED displayProcessor speed is ok.Played PUBG for continous 3 hours. Battery drained by 10% only.Phone is light weight.Wifi calling.5G wifi support.Loved this dark mode.Samsung VPN.Cons:Heating up issues as in all Galaxy M series.Camera quality is average.Full charge requires 2 hrs.Finally 15,999 for Samsung is ok to buy.\n\n", '\n\n  I received this pohne from Amazon yesterday. Let me start by saying that this phone is completely Made in India and the quality and finish is as good as any other imported phone that you will get.The specs of the phone are simply awesome and for the price it is an excellent buy. The Amoled screen is very good and has a Gorilla Glass hence there is no need for a screen protector, but no harm if you want to put one. It is advisable to have a back cover as the finish is shiny and could be a bit slippery.I have still not used the camera extensively but from the few pictures that I took during the daytime, they are very good.Took early for me to comment on the battery life but it comes with an awesome 6000 mAh which lasts for a very long time. Of course this will be dependent on what you use the phone for.It comes with a 15W fast charger. It charged the phone from 65% battery to full in little over one hour.Transferring all your stuff from your old phone to the Samsung M30 was a simple straight forward affair using the Samsung Smart Switch. You will need to download this on your old phone from Google Play Store. I did the transfer using the wireless mode.The specs of this phone are unbeatable for the price.\n\n', "\n\n  Samsung galaxy m31 is excellant phone and reasonable price. Battery life is very good as if we charge for 2 hours it's more than enough for two days.Its had very pixel and great clarity images.videos are amazing.Fingerprint reader is working .\n\n", "\n\n  I have been using M31 from last 3 months here are some pros and cons...Cons‚Ä¢Fingerprint sensor Dose not recognise sometimes, i tried to setup it again but had same issue. But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.‚Ä¢ The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.‚Ä¢The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.‚Ä¢ Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I‚Äôm noticing less lag. Just don‚Äôt get this phone for gaming the chipset isn‚Äôt good enough.Pros‚Ä¢Samsung is known for their Super AmoledScreen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.‚Ä¢On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn‚Äôt good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it‚Äôs average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.‚Ä¢LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.‚Ä¢This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you‚Äôre heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.So overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using  social media...If you‚Äôre heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn‚Äôt for you. So if you don‚Äôt play graphics demanding games on your phone you will like this phone....\n\n", "\n\n  I use my phone for almost around 18 hrs in 24hrs!! I don't know if the heating issue is due to that or not. But its getting heated up after using it for few mins. If you have your phone idle for sometime it cools down but then the instant you start to use it, it gets heated up. Can't have it over ear to speak on a call.PERFORMANCE : 4 starsCAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top. Being in bottom is so annoying that i couldn't place my phone over ground while on vid call.SCREEN CAST : Works perfectly. I tried with my Mi smart tv and its cool.Everything else is fine.Would be perfect if heating issue is fixed.\n\n", '\n\n  The first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is its design. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is good. The battery 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support, 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with an AMOLED screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and Samsung Exynos 9611 processor, are some excellent feature of the Samsung Galaxy M31 Smartphone, which no other competitor is offering right now at this price point.after 7 days of uses:Phone design & look - 5/5Camera  - 5/5Performances  -5/5Display  - 5/5Battery  -5/5User interface  -5/5Sound  -5/5awesome phone\n\n', '\n\n  Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don\'t need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can\'t use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and "reduce animations" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox securityDisplay: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experienceSound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that\'s what Bluetooth speakers are for)Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that\'s not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can\'t sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table\n\n', '\n\n  Phone speed - goodCamera - Very GoodBattery - Huge but device consumption is perhaps highTouch - Smooth (Better than Xiaomi and Realme)Cons - Person on other side while on call complains of a bit low voice. (Remember to turn off wifi calling for better voice. But even than voice on other side is not good)Back is plastic and not glass like other modern phone of this segment.Samsung launched it at cheaper price. Perhaps revised rates after some time.Overall - Good mobile. Will give you better feel than Xiaomi or Realme.\n\n', "\n\n  The Box Contents :The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related PapersFirst Impressions :The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.After a week usuge:1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30sAs a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.\n\n", '\n\n  After using the Samsung Galaxy M31 with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage for more than 2 months, I list following pros and cons:A. Pros1. Very good display quality. Watching videos is a delightful experience2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast4. Apps load quickly as expecteB. Cons1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of "fast charging", which is very disappointing.Overall the phone is very good and highly recommended.\n\n', "\n\n  Samsung M31Reviewing this after one and half month of using this mobile.Pros1. Display is excellent2. Light weight ( though having 6000MAh battery)3. Battery life is good can use for 9 hours continuously with single charging4. No heating, No lagging overall performance is good5. Dual SIM slot ( both supporting LTE) and dedicated memory Card slot is given6. Camera performance is really good specially the Macro feature.Cons1. Charging takes lot of time about 3hrs to get fully charged.2. Mobile Speaker sound quality is not that goodFeedbackI think with this price range Samsung is providing decent features and this is the best mid range mobile phone available in the market. Samsung is actually improving it's performance.\n\n", "\n\n  I used moto g 5 plus for 3 years before this. After having extensively used Samsung m31 for two days I am in love with the software as well as its hardware. There's tonnes of features in this OS optimised by Samsung. There's redmi note 8 users in my house and I can tell you that those phones are absolute Sh!t in front of m31. This phone may not come with features like punch hole display, in screen fingerprint sensor but after having used this I don't miss those features. I hate notches on phones but the one on this is great and doesn't disturb the functionality of display. Great phone to buy overall. And bonus : this is not a Chinese spy phone.\n\n", "\n\n  I am using this mobile since last two month and now I am giving true reviews.1. Battery is very good - 100 %2.

Looks like my 2008 computer built in webcamSamsung apps that can't be removed. (Why add bloatware that no one uses anyways?)Plastic body while Redmi has metal bodies at the same price pointStill, a great phone at this price. I keep hearing rumors about how Samsung phones slow down after a few years, I'll see if that's the case and update this review accordingly. But right now, I do recommend buying it.\n\n", '\n\n  Update: 03Jun2020Visited Airtel store today and the customer care exec told me that all new phones autimatically switch to WiFi calling for better call quality.But I disagree.  Given the fact that WiFi calling is disabled in system settings, how can it be automatically switched to Wi-Fi calling?Still stuck. Samsung... Please help... Honour the phones system settings.-----First Review:The phone is very good in everyday usage.The only problem faced is that the phone automatically switches to WiFi calling while making or receiving a call despite turning off WiFi calling. The network is Airtel.This results in a situation where once the call starts, data gets switched off. No internet connectivity. So cannot talk and connect to internet simultaneously.Am writing this after a lot of googling to find a fix for this.The phone has April 1 2020 patch applied.Can Samsung or anyone out there help fix this problem?Also let me know if it is an Operator related issue (please mention what the operator needs to fix) so I can talk to the concerned.\n\n', "\n\n  Soo this phone is good to buy. It has a decent processor. It has great battery life. Its camera quality is a little bit low in low light or medium light but great in daylight. Selfie camera is great better than most of the phones in this budget range. I have seen some lags in this phones.....not much but still. Best thing is that i can move my apps from internal storage to sd card as most phones not allows this thing. It doesn't heat much even at games like Fortnite or pubg. Speakers are good but in headphone u got dolby atmos support which makes experience of listening music games in headphones great.\n\n", "\n\n  For camera:Change lens to 64 mp in camera setting. Change camera resolution to fhd or uhd.Using macro requires a little bit of understanding.Battery has 3 modes always keep on medium amd check the optimised button. While sleeping keep it on maximum.These are the issues people are facing because they have not fully set their phones.Now,The camera is genuinely amazing. Night shot are extremely well colored and aren't dull.Processor - the exynos 9611Simply put it resembles 675AIE in performance than the 722 AIE. So, that's one factor you need to consider.What does it mean?It means playing  PubG in ultra graphics will be a problem. Just that, at the extreme frame rate the phone will not be able to do it.Note:only at extreme frame rate dies the phone sort of fails.For everything else the maximum RAM usage is 4.2 and then under device care ckean your RAM. Also set the time to automatically clean your phone.Samsung UI is extremely good. It resembles stock android and the bloat ware is not annoying.Screen is next level. sAMOLED screen does its job.\n\n", '\n\n  Battery takes nearly 5 hours to charge completly....

Some highlights :1. super amoled screen- probably the best display in the 11 to 20 k rupees segment, hands down. Much needed if are like me and you read alot on kindle etc. Having used an amoled once, won't go opt for other screens ever!2. Free VPN with Samsung max, so better privacy3. Its Made in India, and the ultimate profits go to South Korea, where samsung is headquartered (not China).4. A pretty low Sar value. So a much safer phone than its competitors, especially Chinese brands, in terms of the amount of radiation u are exposed to.5. Battery life is not that great as they proclaim to be, but it's still good.6. The camera is pretty good in this price range, and the front camera also does its job pretty well. (Tip- you need to change snge the default resolution of the camera to 64 mp to utilize the full power of the lens. Many people don't do this, and then they write bad about the camera)7. A fast charger- thought not as fast as other high end phones, the charger is a good improvement from standard chargers in this price range.8. Much more reliable than Chinese brands, and rest assured, they won't steal your data and won't snoop on you.What it doesn't have - an IR blaster, But that's not a big deal.\n\n", '\n\n  No Regret Mobile Phone. Samsung has improved a Lot. I have used till Note 10 & shifted to iPhone. I bought this M31 to gift to my wife. I am amazed to see the wow üòÆ Performance of this M31. Stunning 64MP Quad camera to document your life, immersive viewing with 16.21cm (6.4") Infinity-U Display, 6,000mAh battery and 15W Fast Charging. Superb Battery Life.

Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ‚úåÔ∏è continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs\n\n", "\n\n  I had high expectations on Samsung M31, but after  using  for about  one week I find it not very impressive. I'm writing  this honest  review as per my observations.Pros -1. Display is very good.Cons -1. Charging takes too long, from 30% to 100% charging, it took more than 2 hours.2. In regard to battery lasting, I don't  find much differencebetween my old realme 3 pro which has 4045 mah and this phone which is claimed to have 6000 mah battery. I have to charge everyday.3. Most irritating is while attending calls in our ears it automatically goes to onhold mode and also call recording  starts automatically while placing the phone in our ears though automatic setting is off. Samsung should really work with this issues and correct the software options during calls.4. Finger and eyes sensor is not so swift like my old realme 3 pro.5. Main Camera is also not very impressive upon comparing  my old phone but yes front camera  for Samsung M31 is better.I hope Samsung  will soon correct all these issues.\n\n", "\n\n  I got a 8Gb 128Gb variant. The phone is great value for money. I'm sure everyone's read the specs and are looking for more user experience insights, so here goes mine. I wanted to buy a phone which gets latest security patch updates at least for the next 2-3 years (else my office mail doesn't work). I also wanted one that was made in India and owned by an Indian entity. A phone meeting both requirements doesn't exist. So the next best option is a good phone (security  patch) made in India by an entity that does not have a Chinese owning entity. Options were Panasonic (Jap) and Samsung (Kor). I've used Samsung phones before so went for this which had the following pros:1. Made in India2. 6Gb/8GB RAM3. 64/128 Gb ROM4. Fast processor (handles heavy apps with ease)5. Smart finger print sensor with notification scroll feature6. Awesome battery backup7. Nice pics for this price8. Amazing display9. Great sound quality, enhances the music experience on external speakers too.10. Auto disable screen timeout when face detectedThere may be many more features I don't use.. but I'm a typical person mostly using for work and some web surfing. I don't play games so don't know.On cons (explaining why I gave 3 stars) is only one.. the first phone delivered started shutting down on its own after a day. I quickly raised a replacement request and I got a new one and that's working great but the hassle of having to do all that is not nice.  I also read that this issue is there a lot. So Samsung needs to take note and fix this.Otherwise awesome phone guys 15-20k range, this is by far the best phone. And it's made in India!! :) go for it guys!\n\n", '\n\n  The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g.

Good Camera..Long battery Charge.Incoming SMS blocking is one of the important provisions in any smart  phone.But in M31, this is partially missing.SMS coming with a phone number only can be blocked. SMS coming without a phone number and coming with names of the business group can not be blocked. This is a great shortfall.Informed to the Help center through WhatsApp chat. They assured that this shortfall will be corrected in their next update. Till the next update we have to live with the disturbance of unwanted SMSs.\n\n', "\n\n  Overall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.after five month of usage till now I won't change my opinion one of the best mobile in this segment. But now Samsung  m31 s is the best competition but SAR value is very low in this mobile. Samsung is best one.\n\n", '\n\n  Well 5 stars to Amazon delivery and service team.The phone I received had some issues with voice quality. It had a weird vibration and echo that use to come while talking. And calls did go blank in between. Not a network issue as I tried using multiple sim.They scheduled a replacement after a technician visit. Same issue persisted. So may be its defect in the make.Camera quality was pretty average. Pictures in day light were decent. Under low light the quality is horrible.Battery life of the 1st model I received was good. Charged pretty fast too. The second one had issues of heating up and battery hardly lasted for 12 hoursWell here it took longer for the refund but have to give starsto the support team at Amazon who kept up the follow up till we got a resolution. Really happy with both the customer service agents who helped in the process.\n\n', "\n\n  Sometimes finger sensor doesn't work like A series.. means if ur finger r little wet it doesn't work properly . But I love this mobile , after many search I choose it and it is best as per my choice. Camera is good for orginal photography, samsung always captures the original picture not like realme or MI type extra brightness.\n\n", "\n\n  Camera is good, call quality is good but the other person's voice can be heard outside even though the volume is low, when you are on call, which is a flaw in samsung phones.Speaker quality when you are speaking from a distance, in WhatsApp video calls is not good. I tried this with MI and they are much better.The major drawback is the claim made by Samsung about fast charging. Only 35-40% gets charged in one hour. So it takes almost 3 hours for full charge. I had Motorola G5 Plus which charged 60-65% in one hour, which means full charge in 1.5 hours.\n\n", "\n\n  After using 1 month, 6GB-64GB varient, Black colourPros:‚óèGood Battery. I am a bit heavy user, still end of the day (6am to11am)40% Remains. I chatted for 3 hours and it sucks 5%battery only. Thats damm cool.‚óèUI is very smooth and handy.‚óèScreen quality is just awsome.‚óèNo heating issue in normal Usage. I have tried 13 apps running in background.(no gaming apps)‚óèFingerprint reader is fast but face detection is not so fast though its good.Cons:‚óèCam quality is not up to the mark. It has 64MP, still edge detection is not that perfect. My earlier mobile was Nokia 6.1Plus which has 16MP cam, still I find that better. Hope a soft update can fix this.‚óèI prefer stock android, ANDROID ONE...anyway This UI is also good.‚óè Mobile heats while gamming. This is not a gamming phone. Though I didn't play PUBG or Freefire or CALLofDUTY. Still it heats.. so no question of playing those games.‚óèCharging time is too long and it don't support fast charging. 15w charger in the box and it takes nearly 2 to 3 hrs to charge this phone 0 to 100... I even tried it with Dash Charger(1plus).. still the result is same.. it has long battery so I will not complain about this as I charge it at night.\n\n", '\n\n  Improved a lot...I bought Samsung M30 while an year ago and very disappointed with the product especially from mob gaint SAMSUNG. Now with M31 model Samsung improved a lot comparing to the M30  In terms of performance and design and External Speaker( Above Avg than Avg). Camera segment  as well.After usage of 1 month here are pros and cons.Pros -Display Quality 4.5 / 5Performance - 4 / 5Heating  - 4.5/ 5Battery - 4 / 5Weight 4.5 / 5Network Coverage - 4 / 5Cons -Majorly, External Speaker ( Above Avg) in short not bad or not good.. ( Samsung have to focus on speakersstill on these models) 3 / 5No Fast charging support ( it takes 2.5 - 3 hours for full charge) 3 / 5Design/Build - 3.5 / 5Overall, have to say tremendous improvement in their SAMSUNG products and giving very tough competition to other flagship models.Of course great thanks to Seller and amazon as usual for sending this..hassle free process.\n\n', "\n\n  To be frank!! I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung  must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery  The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI  Apart this the mobile is good one who are not students if you are a student to buy this you are must be a normal users not heavy users\n\n", "\n\n  The phone is amazing it supports all the games and handling is amazing.The battery life is toooo good after charging 100% which takes almost 2 hours the battery last for more than 36 hours even after using for long time.The camera quality is amazing the quality is pure gold .Super amoled display is very handy and smooth which allows very enjoyable gaming.The processor doesn't heat up even after long gaming hours. The game doesn't lacks at all it have a very smooth performance.I just have one complain regarding the fingerprint sensor which could be more sensitive as it doesn't accept the fingerprint in one go.\n\n", '\n\n  I will say excellent phone overall. Amazing camera quality and battery life. Phone speed is perfect and screen touch and navigation  is awesome. Over all for people who have issues with Samsung this phone, i do not agree as i am experiencing  best mobile phone. Camera quality is perfect and features  are so easily accessible. Under 20 k if someone is looking for  perfect and durable mo ile phone, then bilndedly go for this without hesitation. Amazon too delivered very fast and there was no issie in transferring  previous phone data to this one. Thank you Samsung  and thank you Amazon.\n\n', "\n\n  This mobile have network connectivity problem at it's peak..i was using many other brand mobiles and i didn't face any network issue..this is my first samsung mobile, and for the first time i faced the network for both browsing and calling..even i have the fast network providing sim in my area.. i posted this issue on Samsung member community application.and i came to know thwt Many Samsung galaxy M31 phone users are facing this problem..still no update or reply for this..iam still frustrated about this issue\n\n", "\n\n  I was one of those guys who ordered this 6/128 gb phone on day one. One of the bad phones Samsung ever made. Even after few software updates, it still restarts on its own, mostly while into a browser and sometimes in other apps. Sometimes, instead of restarting, it turns into a SAMSUNG brick, ie phone will not boot and only Samsung logo keeps on displaying for long. In this condition, you can not restart the phone with power button, you have to use RESET method.  Fortunately, in this case, it only restarts and doesn't get hard reset. Battery lasts for only 4 hours of video, otherwise it's pretty good and lasts for 14-16 hours easily with normal use. Voice from earpiece had started getting deteriorate and I found that the earpiece mesh collects lot of dirt because it sits in a groove, thus vitiating voice quality. It's not waterproof (not claimed too) so if you splash water onto it expect touch to not respond and speaker volume to be extremely low for an hour or two. Though it worked perfectly after three hours of drying after I dropped it once in the water and it got submerged fully for a second or two. Samsung Swipe keyboard is little weird, many times typing wrong words. I can't say more about camera as I don't use it much. Single speaker is not bad for listening music. Fingerprint scanner is not so good, most of the time doesn't recognize. Face recognition is better than that. Still, except for the bricking part, it's a good phone for its look, screen/ resolution and hardware for this price.\n\n", '\n\n  This mobile is featured with 64MP rear camera and 32MP front..But after taking few snaps with both rear and front cameras ... The pictures of both are very poor and resolutions are not exact as given to this mobile....At present I am using Oppo F5 6GB mobile.. which has 16MP Rear and 20 Front.. after comparision with pictures taken with phone are far better than Samsung M31(64MP) (32MP).What to do today only i did received my wished Samsung M31 phone.. but bitter experience... Not satisfied... I hoped better resolution pictures but finally ended with disappointment.\n\n', "\n\n  This is the first time i owned a samsung product....and to be honest it is one of the best phones i have owned till date....the screen quality is top notch and battery is just insane...and as i am not a gamer i have not faced any issues with the performance..but i can assure you that if you are a casual gamer than this phone can handle everything thrown to it...it is quite a capable processor, but i have seen so many negative reviews about the processor on youtube...i don't know why??? It is a processor more capable than sd 665 and equivalent to sd 710....but still people are complaining on youtube and reviews.....\n\n", "\n\n  Good phone but BEWARE....(1) The front facing does not look like it's 32 MP.(2)The BATTERY is NOT NOT NOT good. It drains off in 12 hrs flat heavy use. But even if you use it with ease it doesnt seem to stretch to 24 hrs.SAMSUNG's claims seem to be not correct about battery.\n\n", '\n\n  \xa0I have ordered 3 mobiles from this seller.1) Samsung Galaxy M312) Samsung Galaxy M21 (4GB 64gb)3) Samsung Galaxy M21 (6GB 128gb)In first order I received the mobile, which I feel was refurbished item. I placed replacement order and I got replacement.After receiving replacement, I ordered M21 (4GB 64gb) and accordingly I received the mobile. But now both the mobiles are showing one problem and i.e. apps are flickering (i mean apps mobile screen become black and while suddenly while running apps)This problem arose for M31 after replacement period ended. I had to place replacement order for M21. But it is on the way. Few days before I had ordered another mobile to gift someone. Order is delivered today but I am worried about.I this seller has problem. Because I have regular customer for samsung mobiles and first time I am facing so many problems with Samsung mobile.\n\n', "\n\n  One serious issue i got after using it for a month, and i also read many similar comments in samsung community that is the restart issue. The phone sometimes restarts suddenly when we are still using it. And I really dont get any clue why this happens. No warnings, no reasons displayed. It just restarts suddenly..It has happens approx 6-7times during the last month.Overall it's good. But there features which are different from what I expected.The charger is not that slow. It's good enough.The battery doesn't last that long as I expected. Its above average.The position is of earphone jack is at the bottom, which is not convenient for me personally. Especially during video calls, it better to have at the top.The RAM is 6GB but 2-3gb is pre occupied. So I suggest only go for 6GB RAM.The loud speaker could be better in terms of quality as well as intensity of loudness.Overall it's a very good phone.\n\n", '\n\n  I recently purchased m31 mobile set. I am very much frustrated with the net connection. In my area Airtel network is very strong. But the internet connection is automatically disconnected in this mobile. Do everything but could not solve the problem. In the past I had used same data. There was no problem. But after purchasing m31 set I  am fully dissatisfied with the data service. In the data symbol only  uploading arrow blinking. Downloading arrow stops blinking after sometime. I think this is a hardware problem. Please arrange to replace my mobile as early as a possible.Add tags\n\n', '\n\n  You will get handset, charger , usb cable, and ejector pin in the pack.Fingerprinted reader fast.Battery life good.Screen color good.Camera good. You need to select 64mp to use camera in 64mp mode by default it set to lower resolution.Top side of Phone getting too much heated while in video call , or while using camera video recording.I called amazon support , they asked to do factory reset but no change.Playing YouTube video at 480p phone temp reaaches 42 degree.Wifi very weak, not receiving signal from my v380 CCTV.\n\n', "\n\n  I'm reviewing this phone after using it for nearly two months. I bought this phone as a temporary replacement to my flagship. I'm actually very impressed by the price to perfomance ratio of this device. The biggest USP of this phone is its OS. Samsung's OneUI 2.0 has improved tremendously in reducing bloatware and managing RAM efficiently.  It multitasks with ease. The battery life is fantastic. I'm putting my device to charge every alternate day, the screen on time is at least 9-11 hours depending on the intensity of the usage. The Camera quality is great, not outstanding. The speaker is loud and clear. It has Dolby Atmos audio drivers for external audio devices. The call clarity is excellent from both ends. The rear camera does a great job but the front camera doesn't live up to the expectations. It smoothens the images taken from the front cam, not sure if it's because of the sensor or if its in the software. Since it's a budget phone I don't think it would be fair to expect a lot.  I'm not much of a mobile gamer so I never actually tested it in that aspect. The overall build quality is good, looks premium but the entire body is made of plastic. It nearly takes 150 mins to charge to a 100% with the 15W factory charger. The speed doesn't change even if you use a charger of higher capacity. Coming to the conclusion,  I feel this is the best budget phone considering the price and brand value of Samsung. It does its job perfectly and I'll definitely recommend this phone.\n\n", '\n\n  Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.As per suggestion I updated phone immediatelyThe look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.Once this phone restarted on its own.Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.After 3 months, I experience the hanging once every week.Gets heat up a lot on video calls of WhatsApp, Zoom and Duo calls and restarts automatically.So overall, not recommended.\n\n', "\n\n  This is my 4th Samsung mobile device having used different models over the years starting from Wave series.M31 is a definite buy if you are a heavy mobile user where battery, call quality and connectivity is priority.+ Battery has lasted me for more than a complete work day with approx 4hrs of talktime over 50 audio calls over mobile network, 5hrs mix of Microsoft audio call, Google meet audio call, atleast 30-40mins of what's app chatting throughout the day and almost an hr of social media including audio & videos with GPS always ON.Charging is pretty fast.Battery: 10/10+ speed of device which has been brilliant in multi tasking and switching between appsPerformance: 8/10+ support for airtel wifi callingConnectivity: 9/10Camera was never a priority for me however is pretty decent.Camera: 8/10What I didn't like is the bloatware that gets installed from Samsung Galaxy store. That's bit of a pain.OS Software: 5/10\n\n", '\n\n  Premium phone for a great price.The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display with 2340x1080 pixel resolution. The display is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top.Samsung Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 operating system topped with the company‚Äôs own layer of One UI 2.0. The user interface is quite clean and the large app icons give a nice look to the device. There is also an app drawer where users can hide all the apps and can keep the home screen clutter-free. Like other Samsung smartphones, this one also comes preloaded with all the usual Samsung apps along with some third-party apps such as Facebook, Amazon, Snapchat, and others. Samsung has not included Bixby in the Galaxy M31 and along with this the Bixby Vision app is also missing from the device. The device also comes with Digital Wellbeing and Parental Control options which array of usual gestures. For instance, users can double-tap to wake the device and users also have an option to hide the three-button navigation layout and use full-screen gestures to control the smartphone.The camera is one of the major updates which comes with the Galaxy M31. The Galaxy M30s has a triple rear camera, while the Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup. The rear camera of the device comprises 64MP main sensor, 5MP macro camera, 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. On the front, you will find a 32MP selfie camera. The company claims that both the cameras are capable of recording 4K video. Samsung has also added Night Mode in the camera for better photography experience. Like always the Samsung camera app is pretty clean and easy to use and users can find different modes to shoot within the app. Along with this, the app also offers a toggle that allows users to switch between the primary and wide-angle lens cameras. There is also a Scene Optimiser present in the app, which quickly detects the scene and set up the camera accordingly. We were quite satisfied with the camera results of Samsung Galaxy M31. The device was quick to focus and also offered an ample amount of detailing in the images captured. Swinging on the wide-angle lens camera offers a wider field of view along with some really good images. However, we personally loved the macro camera which offered really detailed images. The images captured in daylight were better as compared to the ones taken indoors. The Night Mode incorporated in the device also does a reasonably good job and it reduces noise from the images taken during the night. The 32MP selfie camera does a satisfactory job as both the selfies taken indoor and outdoor turned out to be good.6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. Unlike other smartphone makers, Samsung has included a fast charger within the box. We were able to get through the day of mixed usage with a single charge, courtesy the powerful battery Samsung has packed in.The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you. The smartphone comes under the budget segment but it doesn‚Äôt look like one.\n\n', "\n\n  This was bought for my father. He was v skeptic buying this. We got this for 20,500 on emi. The phone reached in proper condition. The phone comes only with a charger & a pin to open the sim slot. What surprised me is that, no screenguard is already on it and we have to purchase one seperately. I already bought a flip cover for the phone which is doesn't actually do the guarding of screen for minor scratches. Samsung should pre apply a screenguard to smartphones, 20,500 phone and is not a small amount too. We checked the phone everything was good. The camera quality is sub-par. I am not impressed with the can quality. The music is playing well. All ok. Nothing wow about this phone.. just glad it will serve the purpose for my father. Will edit this review once I find out how is the phone working actually.\n\n", '\n\n  Disappointing. Can\'t get worst than this. Firstly received a faulty phone which never got switched on. I did not have option to return, only replacement was available. It took additional 9 days for the replacement to reach me that too after multiple conversations and "so called" inspection and all. After all this when I got the phone which was fortunately in working condition, I\'m not at all happy with the output1- finger recognition is not very good, you have to tap hard.2- Face direction doesn\'t work on multiple accounts.3- phone takes forever for charging. How can they not provide fast charging in the phone of today\'s generation?4- phone is extremely slippery. Impossible to use without cover.5- speaker volume is pathetic.6- camera quality is okay okay.7- picture quality is pretty good.I will not at all recommend this phone. I\'m sure samsung was able to sell huge number of handsets but they are only trying to ride on anti-china notion going on currently. Since there are very less option if you do not want to buy Chinese phone, many would buy m31. However, this phone more look like "something built in hurry in an effort to deliver at comparatively lower price but without much R&D". Dear Samsung, I was not expecting this from you. We deserve better, you owe us better.\n\n', '\n\n  I will divide the review between pros and cons so as one can make informed choicePros:1. Camera creates stunning images.2. performance is good, though not checked any games.3. UI is really well designed, lot of customization available, need to skim through the settings.Cons:1. The battery lasts 1o hours with continuous hotspot ussage OR One and half day with normal internet and mobile usage.2.  Supplied 15W charger takes approx 2.30 to 3 hour to fully charge the phone.3. Camera Video artificial light performance is not good and get worse if slow motion mode is used.\n\n', "\n\n  Obverall performance is best. Samsung is Samsung.  Even better than socalled redmi series. Its display and dolby atmos sound is awesome. Main is speaking clarity over call which is supab. Battery life goes upto 2 days even after using it as hotspot device for my smart TV for more than 6 hrs. primary 32 mp camera takes gr8 pics. I won't say rear camera is not good. It is also gr8. But u can't use flash in 64 mp setting.  Fingerprint sensor and face unlock do its job well. Fast charge takes 2 and half hr to full charge from 10%. But I prefer more slow charger as that will increase battery life. And remember it has non removable battery. So why to worry if it takes 4 hrs to full charge. Overall go for it without thinking for alternate.But one problem, seller didn't supply ejection pin with the mobile. I don't want to return as mobile is superb. But seller must check such mistakes before delivery. For someone he may forget to send charger or even mobile. I would expect that delar to send the ejection pin seperately as I won't get it from market.\n\n", '\n\n  Yeah after 15 days of usage..heres my review about samsung galaxy m31PROS1.Amoled display of course the (best in midrange smartphones.)2.camera quality is awesome u must know fully about it and use.(I have attached a couple of shots.)3.Mega battery (lasts one day even if u do 5 hrs of gaming and 2 hrs of watching videos).4.Brand resale value of Samsung.5.Processor is fantastic for everyday usage and good for gaming.6.unexpectedly fingerprint  sensor works so good.CONS1.Stereo speakers are not so loud..they are just aaudible.2.Not a glass back just a polycarbonate body.3.Its an internet model and back covers are not available though im nt a backcover user but i tried finding some in the local market.4.Only two colour options.5.charging takes 2 and half hours to completely charge the device.6.some heating issue when using wifi.FINAL VERDICTThis is an awesome mobile from samsung that competetes with the likes of poco x2 and newly launched moto fusion plus.If u love an perfect brand to buy which gives  regular updates to keep the phone upto date then defintely go for it.üòÅ\n\n', "\n\n  I am using this phone from 7 days and in the seven days I have reviewed it and below are my observations:Unlock speed-Unlock speed using face recognition and fingerprint sensor is really super fast. you will not feel any lag while unlocking the phone it will open it up with just in fraction of a secondCamera -Having 64 MP camera in a budget of this phone is really unexpected you can click eye catching pictures using front and back camera the back camera has 4 sensors which allows you to click macros, depth , Wide Angle and normal pictures in high definition quality.the front camera which is 32 MP allows you to click steady pictures with wide angle for group selfies as wellBattery life and charging -Well, with the battery life I am not that much satisfied as I expected it to be. Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.Performance -Over all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.Overall summary -In this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on. It's made in India mobile so you can definitely use this mobile without any hassle so go to amazon Amazon Samsung website, buy your mobile, start using it and enjoy!\n\n", "\n\n  Update from my end after 2+ months of use: heat issues has been sorted out after few updates. You can confidently buy this phone at this price range (15-18K).Call Quality - 10/10, crystal clear voiceNetwork quality - 10/10Camera - 6/10 (64mp or 48mp is just numbers now a days, doesn't work like expected). But one thing, Photos in night is really awesome, better than even high end phones I can confidently say.Previous feedback was:______________Heating issue. I have requested return. Heating very much near ear speaker/camera area/top area of mobile (even without charge or apps open). I'll  keep you posted regarding status after 10 days too.\n\n", "\n\n  I have been using this phone for a while now ... And in lockdown situation this phone has given me good support.Fingerprint reader works fine and is located at back. But i am using the face recognition. I feel its better . I tried using my photos to unlock the phone .... No luck ... Works only with my face...Camera quality is good .... From a layman's perspective these are gr8 . From a photographer perspective they are just good. Depth camera gives good bokeh...Macro camera is goodBattery Life is just amazing ... I use this with all office communication apps and still get more than 2 days out of it ... Seriously i am just way toooo happy with it.Not happy with below:Phone is a little heavy because of monster batteryKnox is replaced with McAfeeI even tried some games like pubg and call of duty ... Seem to work fine for me ... So overall a monster (excellent) Phone\n\n", "\n\n  64MP Camera Is Just Gimmick Guys .. Buy This Phone Only For Battery And Display .. Overall 5star Feedback From My Side .. Because My Need Was Only Battery And Display .. I Don't Play Games So I Cant Tell U About The Gaming Performance But Camera Not Good .. But Overall For Daily Use This Phone Is Beast For Me...!!\n\n", '\n\n  It is about 3 months since I got samsung M31 and must say this is best phone in this price range..Good 64mp camera, and good selfie 32Mp camera..Best Amoled display in class,6000MAh battery will last long about to 1-2 days with normal usage,Impressive samsung UI 2.0,The phone is really worthy\n\n', '\n\n  \xa0I have been using galaxy M31 for about 2 months now.Pros:Battery life is really good.Display quality is excellent.Noise cancellation effect is good.Camera quality is suprb in daylight.Fingerprint reader is moderate.Face detection is good.Build quality is good. Once i dropped the phone and thought it would have damaged the screen, but nothing happened. Had it been my previous so claimed metallic Chinese phones it would have definitely caused a body dent and screen crack.Cons:Charging time is high.Night light pictures are not good.For ergonomic use phone would have been a little wider and shorter. This is my personal preference.Overall a g√≤od quality product from Samsung.\n\n', "\n\n  It is a very good product battery life is good it lasts two days camera is amazing it is very clear the ultra wide lens in awesome front camera is also good the fingerprint sensor is very good it is fast also and face unlock is also good game booster is anazing the games are very smooth the system does not have any bugs but inside the you usually get a transparent case but this doesn't have it and the screen guard also the system is really smooth and android 10 is also amazing this phone does not heat up like other phones and its display is amazing its sound quality is also good you can dolby with bt headset and with earphones i say it is  very good\n\n", "\n\n  Fingerprint reader is good unless you have sweat on your fingers..... face lock is very accurate.The battery life is awesome and long lasting. It comes with McAfee antivirus preinstalled as inbuilt part of phone settings. The camera quality is somewhat controversial....... the quality of pictures clicked is very good.... the AI of camera is also nice ... only problem faced by me is it doesn't look like its 64 MP..... my mother has one plus 6 and it has 20 MP which I compared and found has equal zoom..... otherwise the quality of capture is far greater than even my sisters one plus 7. I recommend this phone and in this segment ..... samsung has just got everything boosted. The ram us also good..... I have not played very heavy games on it except once I played a 3.5gb role playing game and it was still working fluid. Front camera is also very good and captures really clear pics. Macro camera is also nice. I charge this phone once and use for almost one and a half day without trouble. It's a bit heavy than recent smartphone but it's because its battery is jumbo but the weight is evenly distributed and once in use..... you will never find it a problem. The Dolby sound AI works really great and is only applicable when using earphones or headset. The inbuilt speaker is also loud and clear. The screen has very diverse, bright and clear display.Totally recommend it ...... I purchased is within a month of its arrival on Amazon\n\n", "\n\n  I share some Tech Details.In First Photo, You see Ram in GB.(5.43 + 2.50)(Ram + Swap Memory)Swap memory work same as Ram and its good to see in Samsung. Also it provide you 7.93 GB instead of 6GB.(Maybe Swap memory use for Game boost)In Second Photo, You see the home with 5x6 grid layout.In third Photo, You see Software Details.In fourth, You see black and white photo.(idk what you call)Samsung Camera is good. Samsung also told you which look is good for shot(AI).Samsung M31 is good for gaming + work + Learning(like I learn Reverse Engineering, So need Video tutorials.. instead using pendrive i use my internal storage and super awesome, when your device comes with sAMOLED display.Battery backup is too good(6000 mAh), It something like (kab battery ktam hogi..) i use 52 hrs without puting on charging.Samsung with 6 with 128GB it's really a #MegaMonster.ü§™üòà\n\n", "\n\n  Not the best phone on the market. can never come close to their flagship phones. So many features are not there. Its like it's made to feel midrange. The camera is horrible. Just take my word for it. When I bought this phone, I read these reviews, and I was like wow these people probably don't know what they're talking about, but yeah it was a late realisation. And of you're a serious photographer, then forgot about this phone. The camera has no pro mode features. It doesn't have manual focus, or shutter speed . Night mode is so gross you're never going to want to use it. The battery was supposed to be amazing, its not. Its just good. Like a 4500 mah battery. If you're looking for a great UI, then I'll have to get your hopes down again. This is not one UI, it on UI core. Which is basically one UI stripped of all it's cool features. Some great alternatives are : Samsung m31s (if you really want Samsung) realme 6, redmi not 9, Poco x2, and Motorola one fusion. You can trust me here I have a lot of smartphone experience...\n\n", '\n\n  Among the range of below 20K, this is the Smartphone, everyone should blindly go with buying without any second thought.It has the needed Elegant look, amazing screen display, camera, battery, Classy feel, etc. JUST GO FOR IT!! This phone has everything that I expected. Battery lasts for 2 days with normal use, listening to music for couple of hours a day including watching a whole movie on prime.Check the detailing of the camera took in the dark in the pic uploadedI have also recommended to my friends and families, and post me I have made them buy too :)\n\n', "\n\n  After 1 month usage, here is my review.I had been using Moto for years now but got fed up with not up to date build quality and poor performance. I am also not comfortable with UI that is far from stock android, so didnt give the chinese phones a look. So M31 was my best option.Samsung One UI with Android 10 is an absolute pleasure to navigate.6GB RAM is more than enough with 3.5 GB always available without any apps open.It multi tasks with ease.Screen is AMOLED Full HD and it completely blew your mind as a first time AMOLED user. The difference between AMOLED and normal screen is astounding. Once you get used to it, you won't be able to go back to normal screen. Best Display on a budget phone hands down.I was discouraged by other reviews saying Exynos processor is not good. However I have had no problems with it. Ofcourse if you compare its benchmarks with Snapdragon, it falls behind but that does not make it a bad processor. But trust me, looking at it alone, it is good with no problems. I haven't encountered any stutter or lag till now. Even gaming like Call of Duty and PUBG is perfect with medium settings. Ultra high drops some frames but that is expected of a budget phone. And anyway, gaming experience is perfectly fine on medium settings.Haven't yet tested camera with the lockdown going on but for normal user like me, I found it to be of good quality.Battery is a behemoth and easily lasts 1.5 days with normal usage. with 1-2 hours gaming, I need to charge it only once every morning.Because of battery its slightly on the heavy side but you wont notice because weight distribution is excellent. Feels extremely nice to hold. I strongly recommend getting a cover as the back is glossy and picks up a ton of smudges. That's the only con I experienced.Having used Moto G series and Moto X series in the past, I can safely say this is the best budget smartphone I have brought till date. Phones with specs like this used to cost 30-40k 2 years back. Absolute steal.\n\n", "\n\n  For the price this phone has really surprised me in the camera department! The shots come out really good n detailed..the only big disappointment is the processor..even with 6gb ram the phone still feels sluggish like a 3gb ram phone...lags time to time..typing slows down..if you are a really fast typer you might notice it..battery charging speed is decent it fits the price range..display is beautiful..another big plus point..vivid mode on the warmer side gives out nice vibrant colours..speaker is average..I'd suggest you put in a few extra bucks n go for the 8gb variant as more ram will help run the apps smoother and may cause less lag.4/5* for this!\n\n", '\n\n  Simple and straight:Pros:- Battery- Display clarity, bcz it\'s Amoled and also the size- Enough speed according to it\'s configuration. Mine is of 6gb RAM- UI, i used Mi before and thought it was the best UI till i started using this. This ONE UI is too good but will let you know about Flaws in "Cons"- This one for Amazon, i purchased it with exchange of my MI mobile bcz of the recent revolution, u know. The exchange value was very good, thanks to Amazon.Cons:- Fingerprint scanner sometimes is non-responsive, have to use power button to awake screen- There is no multi tasking windows available in this UI- Media volume is not loud enough, Bass lovers can\'t have enough loudness when playing music- No IR blaster, which is very useful, Samsung should provide atleast in future- No LED indicator for notificationThese are what i observed and mentioned as per my experience, may be useful especially for anyone going purchase or Samsung and for Amazon. Basing on these, you can consider your priority. Cons aren\'t that big and few can be changed or updated. Finally I recommend for buy. It is a Good Mobile.\n\n', "\n\n  I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.Thanks!\n\n", '\n\n  Wonderful product!!Glad I bought this.It is more than 3 months now since I bought this phone!Battery life is excellent! I use my phone with wifi and data on with multiple apps running together. Even after 8hrs of use it consumes only  50 to 60 percent of the charge.Camera quality is also good.captures fine details well. The live focus is also quite good. For regular use and daily photography it is beyond sufficient.  I had seen few poor reviews about the camera, but it turned out good.The finger print reader is quick and responsive.Overall good value for money! With a sturdy back cover and a tempered glass it Is good to go.\n\n', "\n\n  All are good but I don't think that 6000mah battery works like 6000mah ...battery life not up to the mark what I have desired ...samsung engineers must work on it .otherwise all things are perfect..compared to the price but those who say that 6000 mah battery goes for two days they are wrong  it works max 12 hrs on screen continuously but if u are not a hardcore user it works 1 day full. Those gyz who says in you tube that it works 1 and half day or two days ..that does not perfectly match with the reality.One more think charging time is very high u need 3 hrs to recharge it from zero to 100%. I don't have problem with the charging time but those who have problem with the charging time they may shift to a better option.\n\n", "\n\n  Best alternative for chinese phones by samsung . Not some major flaws but it would have been more great if there was a glass back than a plastic one but it's not that major flaw just put a good cover and  you are good to go. It has an good battery of 6000 mah and goes for 2 days straight . Camera is excellent . The combination of four cameras make the photo look awesome . The fingerprint reader is also good and fast . Samsung has given a seamless experience with stock android and no pre installed apps . I will recommend this phone to buy with closed eyes . Best phone under 20000 rs just go for it without further thoughts .\n\n", "\n\n  Pros:Amazing Screen QualityOne UISamsung branding and serviceMacro PhotographyCons:Despite 6000mAh, I did not find it to be great. It was just good.Coming from an iPhone, I felt android phones' are way behind in Image processing techniques. Realized that pixel MP values are just to lure people and the real power of a camera lies in the Image processing.Rest everything is normal like every other phone.If you want to buy a Samsung 4GB RAM phone and macro photography doesn't matter for you, go for the M21. But If you are going for a 6GB phone, I would recommend you to spend those extra Rupees and get this M31.\n\n", "\n\n  Amoled display very Sharp and vivid.Battery life excellent ...hardly 30 to 40 percent battery down if you are moderate user and not playing continuous game.OS is smooth.CAMERA need to improve , need to check software upgrades but it's not too bad ,only we need to search for better software.Finger print reader is fast.Go for 6 GB and 128 GB option so no need to worry about space issue.9611 samsung equinox processor works well no lagging observed ( i am also using 1st time this processor ...otherwise I prefer SD processor).Charging require 3 hours to full charge..it is just 15 watts charger but dont worry battery performance is great so hardly need to charge.Samsung really pack monster under 20k ( Best price offered.)Best phone offered by Samsung....go for itüëå\n\n", '\n\n  Pro:1) day battery for heavy use2) big decent screen and weight well distributed3) latest OSCons:1) very slow auto brightness2) no front proximity and light sensor, instead front camera is used for all purpose3) phone gets extra warm while charging4) cell signal not up to the mark5) wifi and mobile data switching is not seamless6) lot of bloatware,. Sometimes u will not know whether ur controlling or Samsung controlling the phone.\n\n', '\n\n  I have purchased this phone in June 2020. Its the best phone in the buget. Having good camera quality, battery life is awesome. Battery lasts upto 2 days. If anyone is thinking of buying a new phone. I suggest to go with this one. I was so impressed by the phone so I have gifted this to my wife and I have purchased another one M21. M21 and M31 both the phones are excellent in budget. I like the themes and wallpaper customization of this phone. Sound is great. From my point I can fully satisfied with the phone and I can rate it full.\n\n', "\n\n  After 29 days phone stopped working. Phone is not getting switched on, tried every possible way. Amazon is refusing to replace as the 7 days replacement period is over.I took it to a service center and after few days I received a call from service center that please come and collect your coupon and return all the original box contents to us. I thought they will replace my phone but I was given a SERVICE REFUND COUPON of ‚Çπ17499 which can be redeemed only at a Samsung Store (Not Online). But they catch is no samsung store has samsung m31 or m31s. I don't like the A series phones. Don't know what will I do with this useless coupon. I have no other choice other than buying overpriced A series phones and S series phones\n\n", "\n\n  First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to high storage capacity, security functions and the quality of the camera. For me, the specs are as good I would expect from much more expensive phones. Another reason is that it is small enough to carry in a pocket. I'm not keen the large screen phones.\n\n", '\n\n  Overall the phone quality is good ,but I got very much disappointed with the face recognition feature, the phone took plenty of time to unlock the phone. If the light condition in surrounding is good then it unlocks the phone other wise face could not be detected it says. Previously i had lenovo k8 whose camera quality was bad than samsun m31 still even though i tilt my mobile still it could unlock the phone an bad light also it could unlock quickly.

Great job from Amazon.Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel. The battery was a beast and gives pretty good enough time to use the phone for long time. Camera was nice and overall phone performance was awesome. Really good product  from SAMSUNG.\n\n", "\n\n  Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.\n\n", "\n\n  Firstly I want to describe the phone's external structure :->the phone is very slim .>Holding the 6000mah battery still it is very light.>but for the people with the short fingers it is hard to access the finger print scanner.The security of the phone:->It gives you the access of finger print scanner. It recognizes and the finger opens the lock very fast.>there is also face scaneer which opens the phone preety fast.>no one can access the phone with out the access of phone passwords.Specs of the camera are the followingüëá>64 mp rear cam is very good compared relatively to the phones at this price.the pics just awesome you can enjoy them.>the 8 mp ultra wide camera is very good.>the clarity of 5 mp macro camera is very good compared to top end phones.>32 mp front face is so clear that your friends would be jealous of you during the video calls.talking about the display:->the screen is 6.4-inch(16.21 centimeters) Super Amoled - Infinity U Cut Display.>it supports colours over 16 millon.Gaming specs:->while playing the games like pubg ,COD and fortnite it is not the best .>The battery is so good that u could play upto 20 long pubg games in the phone.>You can download fortnite in this this by the help of samsung galaxy store.so it stil good for fortnite users.In this budget this is the best phone over all the phones.\n\n", "\n\n  Pros:1. Massive battery,2. Brilliant display as well as quality of display. Watching youtube videos or movie is fun in this phone.3. Camera is ok ok.Cons:1. Phone is heating up while charging and playing games.2. High charging time (20%-100% take more than 2 hours 40 minutes).3. Processor is not good. It could've been best phone if comes with Snapdragon medium range processor.I will update the review if I explore something new.\n\n", "\n\n  Pros--1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT  CAMERA  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.3. 6000mah BATTERY  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.Cons--1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX  SECURITY  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.3. BUILD QUALITY  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.4. 15 WATT CHARGER  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.Note-1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.\n\n", "\n\n  Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.Pros:1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.Cons:1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.\n\n", '\n\n  M31 is one of the best mid tier, made in India, "budget smartphone" out there right now for people looking for an upgrade from their entry level smartphones. The super AMOLED display, 6000mAh battery, 128 GB storage and a Samsung Exynos processor, that\'s a little better from the top of the line 600 series Qualcomm Snapdragon line of processors are the strongest selling points. The UI occupies a lot of RAM, 1.8 GB on an average, and the battery performance isn\'t mind-blowing, it\'s great 1&1/2 days of usage easily (playing some games, watching YouTube for 3-5 hours), which you\'d expect from a 6000mAh battery (I expected a little more). The camera is great, macro shots are well lit and crisp, 64MP main sensor senses colour pretty well, and the wide angle isn\'t all that great, but it gets the job done, hyperlapse, slomo features are a great addition. Front facing camera is "okayish". The phone feels heafty and sturdy to the touch, and feels responsive overall, transitions to background apps are a bit jittery, but I believe it\'s a UI issue, and not a performance issue. PUBG runs well, if you plan to play casually. Overall, I\'ve been using this phone for over a month now, and I have no major complain. Totally recommend it.\n\n', "\n\n  Before zeroing in on the Samsung Galaxy M31, I researched the smartphone market in India and tabulated the data in terms of specs. For those looking to not give their money to the Chinese who are using the money to attack our country, among the Non-Chinese smartphones, the M31 presented the most bang-for-buck on paper.The M31 really good in every department, including in its massive 6k mAh battety, its AMOLED display, Android 10 OS, 6GB of RAM, 128GB ROM, Samsung's slick UI.At the sub 20K price range, the phone is an excellent buy.For photographers though not so much since it does not fully support CAM2API. Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k. The 6z supports shooting in RAW as well, unlike the Samsung M31.For the regular Joe though, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a pocket friendly Non-Chinese phone option that is compelling.Amazon's delivered 1 day ahead of schedule.\n\n", "\n\n  Camera clarity is same as 48mp in Redmi note 8. There is no difference. 5MP macro is very waste comparing with 2MP macro in Redmi note 8 (better) and I am Very much upset that in this price range samsung is not providing the clarity  and IR blaster which is not included.  One more thing I don't know why Samsung is not providing headphones now, there is no back case or screen guard.  Please try to include.Not satisfied with CAMERA @ 64MP rear and 34MP Front..  these figures are just for mentioning only but not providing actual clarity.And one more thing..This product is not a scratch proof glass/ Corning gorilla glass. Scratches has happening continuous while putting in the pocket.\n\n", "\n\n  amazing handset in price segment, great features, most and important is don't want to by MI as its origin from Virus country, I feel my contribution towards India and exchange MI with this device.I insist to all great Indians, never by from Virus country and replace or return if you own it.\n\n", '\n\n  Honestly I Like Samsung M31 so much that one by one I buyed total 3 Mobiles and two of my friends also buyed after getting a good feedback from my end, Camera quality is so awesome, shared few clicks above clicked by my samsung M31, main screen have a full coverage,  battery back is just just awesome I mean it has a very good battery backups, mobile processing, camera quality, multiprocessoring and internet make up feel like not to apart from your Samsang M31.\n\n', "\n\n  I purchased this phone for my dad. But i used it for 4-5 days. And on that basis i can say that:‚Ä¢ The performance of the phone is very smooth. I don't find any hanging problem.‚Ä¢ The battery life of this phone is amazing. If you are using your phone without internet then the battery life works for 3-5 days.‚Ä¢ The camera quality of the rear is nice but front cam is not up to that point. It's like you are using front cam with an beauty editor.‚Ä¢ As you all know about the screen, it's just awesome.‚Ä¢ And other functions of the phone starts properly.Before purchasing this phone. I compared it to many of the smartphones. And trust me this tops at first in this range. So, if your budget is around 15000 u can go for it without any doubt.\n\n", "\n\n  I really disappointed with this choice I made,I am writing this feedback after using 21 days ,Pros:1)Light weight2) Android 10.03)User interface is good4)Asthetic5) quick finger print readerCons:1) build quality is not good2) camera really sucks3)I don't know when samuang will stop using Exynos processor n start using Snapdragon,4) Ram manangament is not that good comapre to other mid range phones5) 15W is not enough6) Simple, just Auto Rotate option has not givenWhen you drop down the menu7) though it is 6000mAh, batery life comes  just 1 day though not heavy user\n\n", "\n\n  I purchased a Black 6/64 varient on 4th May and in 3 weeks I can confirm that I regret purchasing an iphone 7plus worth 62 thousand that too 3 years ago.I am not a user who will zoom a picture and compare the pixals, honestly, is that needed? You dont really zoom pictures more than your phone's size so why make the hype.About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use.Somewhere I also feel that this phone provides me more features than ios 13. I don't really miss charging my iphone twice a day lol\n\n", "\n\n  Really great phone at a great price. I have been using since two months..runs smoothly without any lag. The best thing is the display. Amazing amoled display with true black which dramatically enhances the user experience and the infinite display is a plus.The camera is quite good. amazing picture quality with a good resolution. Front camera is quite good and convenient for video calls. 64 mp camera, along with wide angled camera are some cool featuresBut it becomes little bad when you zoom.. like water coloring... image processing can be improved. But is acceptable at this price. Dont expect picture quality like that of an iphone or a 30000 plus phone.Battery is good enough for me. As i use it only for calls and browsing and normal regular use like watching movies, YouTube...it gives a decent battery support and lasts upto 1 and  a half day. Not suitable for gaming purpose. Doesn't feel like 6000 mAh. Might be because of the Amoled display as each pixel actively consumes power. Although, black screen uses no power as compared to LCD, still Amoled consumes more power than an average LCD or LED display. Again, battery performance acceptable at this price when compared to the other cool features at this price.Fingerprint sensor works smoothly.And at last, amazing looks and i really like the ocean blue color and the sides are gradually blackened! Stunning looks.\n\n", "\n\n  I am writing this with my experience of 10 days usage.Battery::I have used many models. Battery wise this is the best mobile I ever used. I use my mobile heavily (personal use, office use, video streaming, net browsing, gaming).

Infact I have a disappointment on this section. Taking too much time to sharpen the picture. Difficult to take children photos. But overall is OKAY... It's camera is good in daylight but in low light conditions picture quality not good.Performance::I give you 5/5 in this section.

At this price today's competition you'll get better ones. Let's be honest. Camera is pathetic. No difference between 16 and 64 MP . I am not a 'mobile gamer' since this device can't do much in there. Also lots of bloatware by samsung. Unnecessary waste updates and apps. Only good things is the battery backup and display. Sound not so great. I don't know why they put a Dolby feature. No change in sound in headphones. Its a Dummy . Speaker an average performer.. Fanboys can suck it. No need to spend this much money for the crappy perfomance. I bought it for 17499 for 6 GB 128 GB variety. Body is cheap plastic. One of the worst kind .Glass breaks easily\n\n", '\n\n  Hi guys,i brought  this phone on 6th march..I dnt know,hw to describe this device features.There is no  s passs,s secure folder and knox security, this is main reason for me.

Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore.

Main 64MP Samsung sensor with good image quality.4. wifi calling feature.5. dedicated SD Card slotBut some other facts to consider -1. in Pro mode camera 'shutter speed control' and 'focus control' is missing.2. Volume Rocker and power button are cheap plastic, although it gives good tactile feedback.3. have to very careful through the setup process, otherwise, you will get lots of unwanted notifications.4. you need a good protective cover to prevent scratches.5. Charger cable/Data cable, provided is short.6. u will feel Battery is taking so much juice to compare to snapdragon SoC, because of Exynos 9611 processor. but u 'll get 1.5-2 days of battery for normal usage.... I hope this will help u to decide before buying this phone.\n\n", "\n\n  Its been like more then 2 weeks since i am usig this phone with my primary sim.I have been testing all the features and usability this phone offers till this time and now i feel i can give my thoughts about this device.So lets make pointers:-Built: I feel the phone has amazing built Quality. Whereas Yes, the Plastic back won't feel much premium but it is actually much more practical then glass back phones. Yes it can scratch easily but who uses a phone without a cover as i would suggest to get a premium cover to get that premium feeling.Talking about Glass back phones it would be very costly to replace but the plastic shell of m31 would be much more cheaper.-Display: As you already knew its best under 20k segment. Better then other Amoled screen and No Crazy 120hz refresh rate but yeah it feels much better to use.-Software: I was using a stock android device previously and the experience of oneui is actually not bad its smooth and even fun to use. There are some hiccups here and there which is acceptable but one thing is that recent app menu lags alot while switching between apps ruining all the experience.It can be fixed via some software updates.Hardware: Phone is not heavy. The buttons are placed right, good quality buttons gives premium and positive feedback. Fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate too.-Camera: The camera quality is actually very good. All the cameras are quite usefull if you know how to use them. The Wide angle and macro camera is also good but implementation is not that great a software update can fix that too.For the night i can say that the shots are blur and grainy if you can use the camera properly then you can take some amazing shots like i do so for me the night camera is also good not great. Whereas some updates can do improvements to it.-Battery: Best battery life of any phone i have used till now. Yes the charging speed could have been better but the battery life is soo good that you will hardly rush for a charge.Note* first charge heats the device bad but after 2-3 days of usage it gets back to normal nothing to worry about. My device doesn't heatup now.My usage includes all day 2active sims, 50% brightness all day, wifi/data ON 24/7. 2hrs Gaming,1hr youtube,  Some calls, and all day social media.With a usage like this, my phone starting from 100% in the morning to 2nd day evening dropping to 25-30%. I never let my device go below that. Even the stand-by time of the phone is great.-Performance: Its fast and fluid. Whereas the ram management could be Better which can be fixed. No heating issue. Good for normal to heavy gaming. Overall the performance is Very Good of the device.This device is not specified for a single use. Its practically a straight forward device which allows the user to use it as a phone should be used. The phone doesn't offer any hanky panky Stuff for attention making anyone mad for games nor for tiktok.Verdict: If you are a rough user or you travel alot, if you are not a mad gamer then you can go for this device.It offers best practicality and usability thats how a phone should be.\n\n", "\n\n  After using 1week I am writing this.First, I would like to thanks Amazon for their service, I got the phone before estimated deliver date.Design of the phone is good.Battery is just awesome. With a moderate use it is giving fully two days service.Camera is also awesome in this price range in both day and night mode. But it can't say as 64MP.There is no heating and lagging problem till now.Charging is very fast. But one thing I found as cons, it's network capturing quality is little worse as compared to Vivo mobile phones.  Otherwise it is a quality product. I would like to suggest everybody to go with this phone.\n\n", '\n\n  This phone is the best phone which we can buy currently especially when this is coming from a brand like Samsung1. The first thing is the screen which is very crisp and clear. Love watching movies on it.2. The processor is fast and one of the best in this price range.3. The battery which is 6000 mah even with a heavy phone usage will easily last you through the day and even more.4. The finger print reader works well.5. The camera is really good with great output all around.All in all, it ticks all the right boxes and you are guaranteed to enjoy this phone. A very easy recommendation for all.\n\n', '\n\n  The Samsung galaxy M31 is the best phone to buy under Rs.20.000 I purchased the samsung brand after gap of 2 years. The phone is worth buying for following reasons.1.Camera quality.(both front and back camera are awesome)2.Fingerpoint reader and face reader works very fast.3.The 6000mah Monster battery works for two days easily even for heavy user4.The super amoled screen in this price range is great.I strongly recommend this phone to all the buyers.Thank you SAMSUNG\n\n', '\n\n  This is my first attempt with Samsung as my alternative phone number. I am a dedicated & loyal iPhone user since beginning but I can confidently say that it was definitely a very good buy. Excellent features, no way behind Apple, great look, back side finger sensor is of great help to easy opening of screen lock. I took some photos , same frames both with my iPhone 11 & Samsung M31. I can definitely say Samsung captured much better snaps in terms of depth, vividness, colour & clarity. Last but not the least , value for money. I must highly recommend.\n\n', '\n\n  It takes more time to charge and mobile gets heated up easily . One of the worst products the samsung has manufactured so far. Really upset with the processor and battery life.  More than 3 hours of time it takes to charge up.one day battery. please dont purchase this product guys . Go for A series in samsung. Camera quality  is not as good as A series in Samsung & oppo. Fingerprint reader nice.\n\n', "\n\n  Awesome phone..I am writing  this review after using  the phone after more than 1 month. Both rear  and front camera is awesome  and quality of picture is good..it suport 4K videos..I am bit disappointed  on battery quality and charging ponit..It is not up to the mark on 6000mAh battery..It takes 3-4 hr to charge the full battery  and discharge within a day.If you will play game,it will discharge withi  10 hr.I am not playing games much,so I am satified but I won't support to buy this phone if you paly games all most of the time in a day.Also I am not happpy  on face recognition..I feel as It doesn't  support sometime..But overall it is a good phone.\n\n", '\n\n  Im writing this review after using it 20 days. I have received my phone on 8th March ,ordered on 5th march when the sell has started.when I took this in my hand ,feel very light weight if comparision to 6000mah mega battery, I watched a movie of 2hour and 5 mins and it consumed only 20% battery ,battery life is very great ,it runs approx 1 to 1and half day after full charge. Charging time is approx 140 minutes.Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up. Worth for money...\n\n', "\n\n  Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smoothBattery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expectScreen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decentCamera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp camProcessor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.\n\n", '\n\n  This device is best...super fast performance with oxygen OS. Super Amoled screen is awesome.you will enjoy watching video or browsing.Battery is awesome ..it gives 24 hours of battery backup with full usage once full charged otherwise with moderate usage it gives almost 2 days of battery backup.Charging is quite slow and it takes 3 hours to get fully charged but it is worth for usage of 24 to 36 hours. Camera is also superb with super video UHD recording. By default it comes with 32 Mpixel but user can change to 64Mpixel and click awesome pictures. MUST Buy if looking for stunning device in this particular budget. I have used almost for a week and then reviewing it.\n\n', '\n\n  I have been using this phone for over a month now. I need to charge once every two days, which is a major time saver. COnnectivity is good. I used to have connectivity issues with my previous phone, which was a big botheration. There are only areas that I have a bit of a concern. 1. the width of the phone is a bit narrow which, because of my thick fingers creates some typing challenges. 2. I wish the charging cable was 0.5 meter longer.Overall a good phone.\n\n', '\n\n  This phone is truly fantastic in this price range.Am writing this review after using for a week.Pros:1. 6000 mah battery is really a monster.2. Camera is excellent.3. Touch sensitivity and fingerprint readers are very goodCons:1. Phone is hanging sometime while unlocking and sometimes while using apps. This might be due to software. I can this came be overcome through updates.2. Observed little heat, after using it for 45 minutes audio call\n\n', '\n\n  Best Mobile for this price. Camera is par at the best. Both the front and rear cameras are excellent and the result is very detailed and very minute, previously was using Vivo V9 that to bought at Amazon. Low light photography is ok. Touch is excellent. Battery back up is also very good. Processing is very good without any lagging and no heating issues even at very very long usage, almost day long. Stylish and the curved edge screen is excellent\n\n', '\n\n  I am using this for more than 6 months. Samsung has really upgraded the software glitches those used to create UI slowness.Pros:1. Camera is best2. Lightweight even after having 6000mAH battery3. Fingerprint sensor is very quick4. Display has wide color range and quite bright5. No software lag6. Best for multitasking7. Blue light filter is really helpful8. The motion stability is pretty useful. It is quite fascination to see that it never feels like the video has ever been shot with the phone holdin in the hands.9. The camera captures images with natural colors, not with punchy color like some other phones do.Cons:1. In Macro mode it is hard to focus on object, but it is rarely used2. Night mode could have been a bit better with grain reduction and with more brightness\n\n', "\n\n  This phone has more than everything I expected. My favorite is this Super AMOLED screen just üòò.Pros-superb battery. 1- 1.5 dayCamera (Rear camera is on other level) + AR Emoji6 GB Ram (more than my laptop)Very nice call quality (I uses Airtel)Finger print sensor is fast.Selfie is better in natural lightingDedicated Memory card slot.Charging speed is not that slow.Feels very nice in hand and can be easily hold in one hand.Cons-Face unlock is slowww and few times didn't worked.Can't uninstall Netflix, Facebook and few other Samsung's app but these can be disabled.Got around 50 GB out of 64 GB.No back cover provided in box.Finger prints are all over the back.VerdictBest phone to buy around this budget. Super value for money. I am very happy to have this phone.Don't think just buy it. You won't regret.\n\n", '\n\n  I\'ve had the phone for 22days now. The finger print reader is fast, no inconsistencies at all. It\'s better than some indispaly print readers.I like the screen, initially wanted the Galaxy A71 for its 6.7" screen, but once I had this delivered I realised a 6.4" screen was more than I needed.The battery lasts for about 18hrs, after which I am left with about 24-28% charge (after heavy usage).Which light usage  I have gotten well over 24hrs on a single charge.One thing I can tell you though, is to slap a sturdy case on the phone immediately after purchase.\n\n', "\n\n  I love its simple design,one ui 2 and the sAmoled display,battery life is also good.But the camera quality is not that good as it has a 64 MP shooter... Its images are blurred and there's too much noise in it when using night mode...there's a lot of difference between normal vdo taking and with Steady mode on( vdo quality is not that good and there's noise)I bought this phone and after day 4..it started hanging while opening Amazon app..the menu hangs sometimes..so i replaced it..When opening.. the replaced phone has some software issues like the data disconnect randomly on its own for some time and while this happens i cant connect calls to anyone..first it doesn't ring..then even if the call is picked up on the other side..i didn't get to hear the voice..and when the hand up the call it still shows call on progress...and i have no network problem in my area..and all my other phones are working perfectly. I am very much irritated by this..so I'm returning the M31..\n\n", '\n\n  No guest mode, the only major drawback.Galaxy store downloads application without permission from user.You can hide applicaton but it would be hidden without security. With big battery, one has to deal with weight also.Camera is superawesome. It even captures the sunlight without making dark pictures. But there is no focus available in slefie mode. If image is captured through whatsapp camera, it will automatically crop the image everytime.\n\n', '\n\n  Phone is okay type, only plus point is the battery life which is really good.The piece is slightly heavy piece.The antutu benchmark details are enclosed.Finger print reader is real quick. But face scanner is too shabby as it takes time to unlock.\n\n', "\n\n  Hi All,Please don't buy this scrap from Samsung.I ordered it on the very first day of the launch and turned out to be a great mistake.The most important feature of any mobile  is making and receiving calls and this phone has problem with that only..All calls irrespective of dailed or received gets disconnected automatically within a minute.When I searched for this problem, found out that there are thousands of people who have the same problem.You can Google it yourself to see the harsh reality.Please don't but this.\n\n", '\n\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 is the Perfect package out there. The Mega 6000mah battery easily gives me 2 days of battery backup. The 64mp camera gives amazing details in the photos. And the best part is, you can also take macro shots, not just with the macro lens, but with the help of 64MP camera too.I was looking for few of things from my new phone. I wanted a great camera, great battery backup, unique and elegant looking design on the back of the phone. Samsung Galaxy M31 provides all of it. Plus a Super-AMOLED display. Samsung is THE best display manufacturer out there. The exynos chipset is no less than any other chipset in the market.This phone has made me decide that my future phones will be of Samsung.\n\n', "\n\n  This phone is not as good as we expected. I bought it on 18 March 2020. So I am using it for more than 4 months. I was super excited while I saw the features like battery, camera, screen size all in my budget. But from past 1 month, I am facing an issue. Sometimes while I use the camera or watching a video and sometimes while I play the game into it, its screen gets completely black. If within 4 months I am facing this issue then I don't expect that it will work even for a year. Completely disappointed with Samsung. I won't go for Samsung in future.\n\n", "\n\n  Best device around 16k-17k. Overall 4.2/5.Build quality not good. I mean just nice. If i rate it then 3/5. Actually the back of the device is made with polycarbonate so If it were glass, it would be the best all-rounder device in this budget.Screen just superb. 4.7/5.Camera quality also nice. 4/5.Performance also good. I used Samsung J7 prime for 2 and half years. So i know what is the problem with exynos processor. So there exynos 9611 also good processor for approx 2 years. But then this is behave just a 7k-8k budget device. If there was a Snapdragon 712 or 720G processor, it would definitely be rocking device from SAMSUNG under 20k budget. Okay  but the current performance is really smooth and cool. So 4/5.Fingerprint scanner good but also have face unlock option so no problem for device lock security. Both work fine. 4/5.Battery gives approx a day with medium usage. 4/5But charging time really slow. 6000 mAh battery takes time to getting full charge around 2.5 hours. 3/5. Ok let's talk. I think i covered all the pros and cons. Then you decide that what should you do, buy or not buy. If you ask me then definitely go for it if you watch movie and video with decent gaming. I don't think of any other mobile for watching movies or videos. The screen just AWESOME. That's all.\n\n", "\n\n  Purchsed one on launch. Had almost made up my mind to buy M30s but saw notification of this M31 being launched so kept my purchase on hold. The features were good at the price. The wait was worthy. Now using almost since 3 months.Truely monster battery. With my use easily lasts bit more than 2 days. Fast charging supported. 50% charged within about 40 min with the provided 9V charger. This is sufficient for a day if one is in hurry to leave for work. By the time one gets ready the phone can be charged 50% almost.Full charge takes about 2.30 hrs. Samsung should have provided a 15 V charger in box as they provide to all the YouTube reviewers. All reviewers spoke of inbox 15W charger.I would have given 5 star rating in all categories then.The finger print scanner occasionally fails to unlock with finger print. Have to press the lock button and unlock again with the finger then. Don't know the reason why this happens.Though I am not a selfie lover or one who keeps on clicking photos often, I found the camera quality good enough, both front and back.Sound quality is ok. Though feel the speaker could have been bit louder.No doubts about Samsung amoled display, it's the best. Samsung being pioneer in this. Very bright even with low settings.Signal reception has no problem.Expandable memory is a good feature we usually do not see now in flagship phones also.Overall good product at this price. Go for it.\n\n", "\n\n  \xa0I am using this Megaphone from last 4 days. Here is review-1. As claimed the strongest part of this phone is Mega Battery and it's TRUE in every term. With moderate use throughout the day Battery was down to 80% only from full charged in morning. I watched movies for another 2 hours continuously reducing only 10% further to 70%. charging 1 hr was sufficient to get back to 100%. Totally Impressive!!2. Camera is phenomenal. Wide angle, super slomo video, hyperlapse, clicks with auto adjustment, night mode, zoom.. all are best in every term. I have attached few clicks & videos. Check out3. Very user friendly functions. Everything seems so simple. That's best part too.4. I used Samsung smart switch app to transfer my entire data from my old android phone to this one. Without any hiccups totally got that done in one go everything including messages, call records. Everything in matter of hour. Seamless experience.4. You can create your own emoji.

It keeps hanging frequently. While operating any application on phone, it stops responding along with this is issue the speaker quality has become very low (basically it does not functions) No Sound at all. Even while playing random videos on YouTube application as well in the phone's gallery it automatically gets fast forwarded without giving any command.Its altogether a very disappointing experience not only with the Samsung Phone Brand but also with Amazon Prime Membership Account and the online Retailer (STPL Exclusive Online) listed on Amazon.I would request to please get the Product replaced Asap, as Due to lock-down I am unable to even take it to Samsung Service Center or to any Mobile Repairing Shop.Note: Kindly Respond to the above complaint, or legal action will be taken further at your Cost.\n\n", "\n\n  After using an iphone this phone feels quite low in performance.

It's a gimmick. A good 13 mp is equivalent to the said 48 mega pixel.

Overall Handling is quite satisfying. With an Amoled Screen and a good resolution perfect for binge watching. You can switch between Vivid and Natural colours though (don't know why it comes in vivid default).2. Has a 64 MP rear camera with ultra wide and depth however as anyone would have a nick for wanting the best, there still is room for improvement.3. Comes with Face recognition and Finger print scanner, however there is a fraction of a second's lag while unlocking the phone. Recognition does get better with more use.4. Has an inbuilt Optimiser in the UI with anti-theft features to clear up memory,check battery usage and scan through an inbuilt antivirus. So that is an addition, however a third party antivirus should still be used as back up.5. The smartphone boasts of a 6000mAH mega battery and it lives up to the figure with 9-10 hrs of battery if used continuously and upto 2 days with normal to minimal use(Frankly speaking I gifted the phone to my mother and was surprised to see it working at 28%, the day after it was charged..also it was charged in the evening around 5 pm...so still not 2 days). The Charger supports fast charging but I wouldn't compare it to One Plus' dash charging as it would take upto 150 mins to reach full charge on M31.Eventually I did want to buy one more for myself,but there already is one M31 in the family.A great buy.\n\n", '\n\n  The above stars are only for battery, AI features and camera.CONS :1) SLIGHT HEATING ISSUE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND AS WELL IN THE BACK2) WIDE ANGLE CAMERA IS NOT CLEAN IF YOU TRY TO ZOOM IN AT ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT4) POSITION OF SPEAKER IS POOR AS IT GETS BLOCKED WITH FINGERS WHILE PLAYING GAMES OR TEXTING .

In fact, Samsung told us at the Galaxy M31 launch that the camera, battery life, and display are the most important factors for young people nowadays, and those are the parameters it focused on when designing the Galaxy M31.The Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that‚Äôs pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there‚Äôs a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn‚Äôt feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone‚Äôs liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.At the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ‚Äô64 megapixels‚Äô mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There‚Äôs also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phonesThe ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s‚Äô ultra-wide camera. It‚Äôs useful to capture a wider scene, but don‚Äôt expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it‚Äôs great if you love taking close-up shots, though it‚Äôs often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.Here are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots\n\n', '\n\n  Iam always been big fan of samsung display and camera and ever since I had used them I haven\'t thought ant going 4 other chinese brands with cheap LCD display on which u can neither appreciate a good pic nor game or enjoy movies on it!!6.4" Full hd Amoled screen + 64 mp/32 mp camera + 6000 mah battery wd fast charging was too much to ignore even when MI & realme were giving very competent specs at lower price but it\'s lcd display & camera was not 4 me hence I went for M31  and it outperformed my expectations!!From phone display to camera quality to battery life to processor it was just perfect for me in 15K..I wud hv appreciated a gradient glossy panel but ocean blue color is actually very beautiful and shiny and phone doesn\'t feel heavy at all!!Battery is huge and for full charging it does take time but it can easily last a day on 50‚ÑÖ charge for normal usage so iam not worried abt battery life and 15w charger  !!6 GB ram is the most impressive feature of this phone,thank u samsung.64 MP rear camera and 32 mp front were treat to click , u don\'t need any 3rd party app to adjust/beautify ur clicks such gr8 has been camera quality of M31!!Slow motion recording both front and back was the feature I was looking forward to and I loved it!!Iam not a heavy gamer but this phone can play pubg ,asphalt, mortal kombat and other heavy games wd ease!!Finger print reader works well this time in samsung M31 !Few tips and tricks:By def front camera is 21 MP in order to select 32 MP option select wide-angle option and then select 3:4 full option and u will see camera size 32 mp.For rear camera 64 mp option is available in options u hv to just look into itSlow motion is available in both front and back camera but super slow motion is available in rear camera only! Loved that feature!Only downside I found was knox security not present but u can always install a good antivirus to keep ur m31 safe!!McAfee is there anyway to keep u safe!!No complaints only praise for this beautiful and affordable monster, if ur planning to upgrade ur fone wd impressive quad camera , beautiful display and huge battery M31 will not disappoint u, it is d best phone in terms of camera, battery, display and with 6gb ram and xynos latest processor it can easily do multitasking and gaming wd ease.. I loved it,it works like a charm\n\n', '\n\n  Pros, light weight and cameras decentCons, battery has serious heating issues.. i was on a long drive..  had maps and music on in the background...after 4 hrs.. the phone was heated up to a point where the apps started closing.  After 2 more hours the ph had totally heated up.. and the phone conked off.. i needed maps and had to park to the side.. anotherfunny thing was i had the car charger on even then the ph battery died.. samsung still has serious battery, heating issues.. am not impressed .\n\n', "\n\n  Great display for the price range and I am happy that I shifted to Samsung for this reason.Battery life is good and lasts for almost 2 days with normal usage with WiFi, but it's not the best as it drains quickly with 4G.Camera is decent when it's outdoor. At low light and indoors it's just an average camera. Live focus selfies and night mode(front and rear)are useless. Live focus / portrait blurs out some portion of the face which is very bad.Call quality and speaker quality is fine.Samsung One UI is good but it misses out some of the important features as it's M series phone.\n\n", "\n\n  I bought this as my b'day gift & also b'coz of my bro. He insisted me to buy this & I think I have made a right choice. I am in love with the camera of this phone. N the other features such as battery, speed, storage, Ram etc. Are all good till now. I have been using now for a week & till now my experience is good. At this price the deal is very good.I think every phone works fine maximum 3 years. So I think the price is good & worthy.\n\n", "\n\n  First of all , I would say the phone has extremely good battery life while using continuously (Gaming Netflix) it delivers upto 13-14 hrs backupFingerprint reader is very fast, phone gets unlocked with just a touchCamera quality is also very good in daylight and in low light it is satisfactoryI didn't face any lag while playing PUB-G , the phone did a great job. I also loved the Super amoled display, it delivers a very good quality viewing experience.Overall the phone is doing a great Job, I didn't face any problems as of now loved it :)\n\n", '\n\n  Bad experience of a Samsung product even after years...Hate the processor (Exynos 9611) as it doesn‚Äôt support quick performance or fast charging.Just after a day of use got ghost screen touches problem and was hard to force restart...got solved automatically but lost my confidence.Better processor, fast charging, glass build quality would have been better for the price.\n\n', '\n\n  Great phone,My indoor coverage is too poor means no network, but wifi-Calling method is better response, working on Jio and Airtel. I have no sim on Vodafone/idea so I am not able to say that wifi calling working or not. Jio has receive and send message, calls also but airtel not able to receive message on wifi calling  only able to call. You have activate wifi calling some times your mobile have able to tower network than you have able to call them.Phone have good response on camera, memory and overall. Low light have little bit camera resolution issue, outdoor area working perfect.\n\n', '\n\n  Fingerprint scanner is little bit slow. Face detection also slow. Camera quality is optimum.But this phone has big problem for signal strength.This phone shows fake signal that means no incoming and outgoings call is possible many times but signal shows.I compare this phone for signal strength by red mi note8 pro and vivo brand phone,Samsung M31 catches low signal strength (that means I do not use internet as good as we do use good internet speed in other phone brand such as redmi note,vivo brand phone.)This is mazor problem in samsung M31phone.\n\n', '\n\n  1st I brought this phone from my brother account in may via amazon. That phone has problem with display. So they tried to replace phone but I cancelled. Again I place from my amazon account, I received phone on may 23rd, till June 16th it is working fine and now am facing problem of shaking screen. Now samsung chat support asking me to go to service centre. Really worst phone. I recommend not to buy this phone\n\n', "\n\n  Samsung M31 is wow for its battery. Fingureprint reader is very nice it recognized very quickly, someime I found it's  unresponsive (3times in a 2 month) so used face recognition  or have to use PIN. Camera I like to use 64mp main camera at 3:4. It is amazing in revealing details of close up picture (you can see clearly and  detail of these tiny roof moss/algae, 3.5mm headphone jack was used for size comparison. When I use for scenery photos are good too. Only problem I found is sharpness of photo at highest zoom ( zooming photo to its highest) I think sharpness is good but not best. Samsung should improve processing of photo for excellent shrpness otherwise what  is benefit of giving better lens. I usually use  Adobe lightroom. Last 2 pics were processed in lightroom.  All other camera are  good too. Video quality is very good. All I'm very satisfied for having Samsung M31 phone.\n\n", "\n\n  I am writing this review after using this phone for 4day.This is a best budget phone in the range of 15000 as whatever u want  all the things are inside this phone, if u compare this phone  With One plus 7T  Then in camera and battery backup  this phone get a Superb value. I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.I want to explain it's some feature as below1stly Battery 5star2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.3rd Front camera - 4star.4th Processor - 4star5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4starThese all ratings are out of 5.Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..\n\n", '\n\n  Fingerprints,  Battery  life and Also Cameras quality is best I give +5 Rating. Thanks Amazon  and also Specialy thanks to STPL Exclusive Online Sellers  company.\n\n', '\n\n  I bought this phone for my husband and he couldnt have been more happy.I will write about the things he liked best.1. He says his laptop has a Ram of 8GB and this phone has 6GB of Ram and because of this huge Ram, the phone runs like makkhan ( Indian Butter).2. The camera quality is like awesome. He never used to click these many pictures before. It has special food button which is specialized to click pictures of food items. The night camera can make night look like day, ITS THAT GOOD.3. AR EMOTICON : Now this is something I like more. It can turn you into emoticons which is like very cool.4. Battery life : After the first day when he charged the phone to 100%, he only plugged the phone into the charger after like 2 days. The c-port charger is also like an add on.I find it a worthy investment :D\n\n', '\n\n  The battery life is something which makes one remember the famous old advertisement which said "Kya Karu Petrol Khatam hi nahi Hota". It lasts long really long.Phone is super smooth with no lags. The display is very bright and the sound quality is awesome too.The camera is one of the best in the class and probably much better than anything available in this range. Please note that you have to change a few things in the settings to be able to use the camera in a better way. The default camera mode is controlled to conserve memory.The only annoying thing is that few apps are automatically installed with software updates.And, then you have to take the extra effort to locate it and remove it.\n\n', '\n\n  sAMOLED screen is the biggest plus point.Battery is huge but the charger is bit slow, 18 watt charger takes a lot of time to get it charged. 30 watt charger would have done the job.Speakers are loud but only primary speaker works not good for dolby atmos experience.Camera is good not the best.face recognition is just pathetic.finger print reader is not that fast.processor is average not as powerful as latest snapdragon processors.\n\n', "\n\n  The phone is really smooth in operating, it's amoled display does give you a feel of holding a premium phone in hand, it has 6000mAH battery, the phone is really handy, plastic body, but still very grippy, it is light and fits in your hands perfectly, and not like other phones like redmi 8 pro and so on which are much heavy and oversized, it is packed with exynos 9611 I was skeptic about this processor since I was into Snapdragon before, but yeah, the exynos does the work, and the main thing, for most of them buyers, playing games, tried PUBG on this phones, there are very little very very little frame drops, phone heats up sometimes, so I always play by taking off the cover, battery does a great job while playing PUBG, speaking about the camera, trust me, it is a camera of flagship level, I mean the clarity is so great for daytime conditions, haven't tried clicking anything at low light, since I didn't need one, main stuff, it also has 3.5 mm Jack and Dolby atmos support, so you can expect some great earphones experience, and I guess that covers it all.\n\n", "\n\n  Got the handset M31_128GB on Thursday (21/05/20). Yesterday  complete data transferred and apps are installed.  Today afternoon 1.30 pm onwards handset started heating abnormally. I don't know the exact reason For heating and I am really worried what needs to be done, replace the same or refund. As it's just one day old, am not able to decide for further steps. Pls suggest\n\n", '\n\n  Best 64MP Quad Camera I find the quality best when compared with good mobiles, more MAH battery 6000mah and fast charging,Good processor samsung 9611 socI was earlier using Oppo and upgraded to Samsung M31 and writing this review after more than 5 months of using this phone.I would give this Monster a 4.8 Rating when compared to the other phones in its class.Amazing quality, Good service and durability üòã\n\n', "\n\n  After using Samsung Note 3 for a good time, I shifted to M31. The huge battery has been a big relief for me and from the battery drain tension when going on a long trip. I don't use it for gaming so typically I have to charge twice in three days. You may need to keep for a long time for it to charge fully.  The screen display is sharp and clear.The build is good. It fell a couple of times from bed but the curved edges on the sides have prevented it from getting scratches. I don't like putting case or screen protector as it increases the weight and reduces the aesthetics. Also, don't put keys in the same pocket as it can give permanent marks on the glass. The black backside is a finger magnet and it will take some time for you to get used to it.I have given five stars also because of customer care which takes your error reports seriously.\n\n", "\n\n  Wonderfup option for water heater,Most pathetic phone I have ever seen. Heats up unbelievably highCamera is awesome but no use after 20 mins camera will stop due to excessive heat.Battery life is fake don't believe nowhere compares to claims made. Fast charging beyongd 75 % is not availableI don't know why samsung made such poor quality phone would not recommend anyone to buy thisThere are far better and cheaper options available for water heater.Being locodowm I could not even exchangeI only went because Samsung was the only option available in nonchinese option but I regret my decisionWe have no other option other than Chinese phones\n\n", "\n\n  This phone is fully packed with features and specs that I don't need to mention. What you need to know is it's UI is great but on the cost of processor and finger print. It's been almost 2 months and it has started to hang and sometimes to the extent where I have to restart the phone. And talking about finger print scanner it's worthless man because it most of the time doesn't detect it (if you have sweating finger even a bit of it) or delayed detection. Apart from that it's a great phone but these 2 cons are a major one so won't recommend it.\n\n", '\n\n  Never buy phones from Amazon. They have sent me defective phone. It is switches off several times,  this phone is not even receiving network properly. Internet speef is like 2g and people on the other end always complain about my voice getting cut and low voice during the call. I was assuming that due to lockdown Network is weak. But its been two months I have been facing same problem and have realized the phone is defective. Amazon is not ready to replace the phone. This is my first and last phone from Amazon.\n\n', '\n\n  Pros.1. Super display to watch movies, YouTube and web series.2. Excellent battery backup, min 2 days at moderate usage3.

Video quality also good and auto focus is also very fast6. Fast processor handles multitasking smoothly7. Gaming and graphics are manage very well, very smooth experience8. Touch sensitivity is nice Cons1. Build quality should have been better than this as no frame is used and cheap plastic is used at the back.2. Gorilla glass 5 should have been given instead of gorilla 3.3. Charging time is almost 2 to 3 hours from 0 to 100%4. Brightness lacks in sunlight5. Dual speakers should have been given instead of mono speakerOverall must buy product compared to other brands in market at this price point.All features are upto the mark as mentioned in the featues nothing lacks behind.\n\n', '\n\n  Review after one month of usage:8gb RAM is not really working like 8gb...its slightly better than previous Redmi Note 4-4gb RAM.Battery is good. Lasts more than a day with moderate usage with more than 100 apps installed.Camera is very good.Night photos need to be better.Function & additional feature wise, its too good.Feature of working in pop-up window is very good.Sometimes, bit slow in responding.Overall, its just a good phone in below 20k budget.After 45 days of usage, CHANGING TO 3 STARS !!\n\n', '\n\n  software update is bad it got freezed or hanged totally while updating software at time of lock down now getting replaced or returned is not possible and even service centers are closed even customer care support are unable to solve it so i had to buy new mobile.... i suggest pls do not go for this mobile this is waste product performance is very bad very slow gets hanged lot with moderate usage battery is also just one and half day, camera clarity is not up-to mark, had lot of belief in Samsung products till now i was using Samsung products now because of this bad product i strongly suggest not to go for this, it has got Samsung exynos processor the performance is not good....pls i suggest dont go for htis product.\n\n', "\n\n  I Bought this phone on June 14 th after opening the box I got disappointed. The first pic I took in the front camera is the worst camera pic I have ever seen .There is no pixel or clarity it looks like 1 MP camera. After that I took a pic from back camera the picture looks as if it is taken from some basic phone .I got this phone for 18 k within 5 hours I sold it to my frnd for 14 K who recommended this phone for me. Already I'm using asus mobile for 9 K the camera is much much better than M31.Secondly I went into the youtube and opened a 4K video and went into the setting to change the resolution to 1080 pixel video but it was an sock to me the maximum resolution value is 480 pixel only.You can play the video in 480 pxl only.Tats y they did not release the mobile in the showroom.

Brilliant  performance, brilliant battery life, amazing camera, brilliant overall.1. The screen.sAMOLED display  is on point, super clear & very well user friendly.2. The camera.Stunning. 64mp does the job the way it's supposed to. Front 32mp camrea is also very impressive. In the rear, quad camera setup is impressive. The sample images are a few example of the camera quality. Also the wide angle lens is a rather wonderful function.3. The battery.Probably the biggest highlight of this smartphone is the battery. A MASSIVE 6000mAh battery can easily go on throughout the day with enough battery life left for the next day. For an average user, the battery will easily live upto 2 days. Heavy usage? It will still go on for a day. Even when the battery is about 15 to 20% the performance doesnt show any decline. The only thing i found a bit not so good about the phone is the charger. M31 comes with a 15W charger which will take atleastaround 2.3 hrs to charge fully. But the new M31s fixes the problem, it comes with a 25W charger & the same 6000mAh battery promising shorter charging time.4. Built quality & design.Front and rear looks impressive. Has a very modern yet conservative designs. Doesn't feel that heavy while holding and is also a perfect fit in the pocket.The blue colour looks beautiful but the one i have is a black one. Yes, the black looks cooler but since the rear is made up of plastic with a glossy finish, it can very easily attaract scratches and fingerprints,  so I'd suggestanyone to use it with a mobile cover.5. Verdict.Overall the smartphone is an impressive package. It simply proves that spending over 50k on a smartphone is insane. Some complain about the processor that is Exynos 9611 which is in my point of view nothing to be worried about. Every function runs smooth and easy thanks to the processor and 6gb RAM, touchscreen is also very responsive,  also the power button can be used to open apps as a shortcut. With 128gb space, dual sim support, 6gb ram, a great battery life, sAmoled display, this phone has everything that it takes to be a flagship phone competitor as a considerable margin. Its almost been more than 2 months since im using this phone and so far i haven't faced any problems with the device any hopefully will not face any in the coming future. The surprising thing is that with all the power packed in the box, it still manages to fit under 20k category which makes it incredibly appealing. I'd surely suggest if anyone is looking to buy one!\n\n", '\n\n  Call record option not available on this model during call duration, which is the worst thing about this phone,Phone is average not best, like samsung devloped some things, but still need to devlope more with compare operating wise,graphic wise resolution wise,camera quality wise, fast chrging wise.All other brand with more specification models are available at lower price around  9-10 thousand.Where same thing we are paying 17.5 thousand for this samsung model.I buyed this phone only because of to support #boycuttchinaproduct movement.Otherwise nothing special like other brand phone.\n\n', "\n\n  Display is fabulous as it is Super Amoled display, no pointing discussing about it. Now fingerprintscanner is pretty hippy, so full Mark's. BEST part is the battery last almost two days plus for me, I am not a gamer but social media bug, watch Prime YouTube and More.With all this I am not going with exynos processors capability as I have not put it to test.CAMERA is good but what disappoints is 64MP setting is only in 4:3 not fullscreen and Pro version has no aperture and shutter control, my wife's one and half year old Huawei mobile has that, seriously Samsung if I r going to compete with Redmi note 9  and realme 6 I got to up the ante a bit more ...\n\n", '\n\n  Finger print sensor is really good.Phone just unlocks within milliseconds. Battery life is also good an average phone user can use the phone for 2 days once if it is charged with 100%.camera quality is good.I liked the UI and functionality of the OS very much.I already used samsung A30 which is quite slow compared to m31.I found that M series is quite faster in terms of response .I liked the new features like multi language typing etc...Overall this product is price worthy.\n\n', '\n\n  This phone has an excellent display, which is good to look at even outdoors when the sun is shining brightly. The display quality makes it an excellent multimedia phone too. The signal reception and call quality are pretty good. The speakerphone does the job. The best part about the device is its battery life. It lasts a day even with close to heavy use, involving much web browsing, a lot of movie viewing, and listening to many audio files. The device has a great camera for its price. I am not that interested in camera, but my shutterbug friends told me that the pictures taken through it are good. Another valuable feature is Dolby Atmos, which improves the sound output quality of the Bluetooth speaker connected to it.I do not have any flaws to say regarding the device. A slight quibble is that the back panel catches fingerprints quite easily, but using a back case solves it.\n\n', '\n\n  Overall the product is ok. What I did not like about the product:1) Fast charger: It is just 15W. Although when you plug-in it says "Fast charging" it still takes approx 3.5-4 hours to fully charge. Too slow in my opinion.2) Some of the preloaded apps from Samsung are very annoying. Specially the camera app has one very bad feature. After you record a video and want to see it, it starts playing automatically. If you want to scrool forward, backward, pause etc, there is no control. It has to open the video again using a different app and then you can control. Such an annoying thing.\n\n', '\n\n  Awesomme phone. The camera quality is fantastic. Especially the live focus. Battery life is amazing. Fantastic performance. For this price range, its a superb dealThose who have given negative reviews are definetly unable to access the phone or are not able to understand how to use it.I find it really handy and very smooth in functioning.\n\n', "\n\n  been using this product for 20 days it's value for money. infact I exchanged it for MI 5 used for 3.5 years and got M31 for 12700 inr. wanted made in india product hence opted for Samsung. I am not a gamer hence for me battery backnis very good I use my phone till next day for 100% charge and still have 50% left. I see split second lag in face recognition fingerprint scan response well. takes time to get familiar with the features but now it's fine. touch screen responds well. photo quality is good with wide angle and low light. will edit my review after six month.\n\n", "\n\n  The look is very attractive.The touch is very smooth and sensitive. Works really fine. Fingerprint is fast enough. Even with little moist finger, it works really fine.Face recognition is amazing. Fast. Even in a bit darker room, its able to recognize if you bring your phone a little closer.Battery is 6000 mah. With full 100 percent charge, It will easily work fine upto 2 days. Given that you're not using much wifi and data.Camera quantity is good but not that great.The main camera is 64mp. But when you zoom in the pic, sometimes the pixels get distorted.The wide angle camera is amazing. Although it's just 8mp, but the picture quality is really amazing. Captures 123 degrees wide.Macro and Depth Camera is 5mp. The picture quality and pixel is great. The focus on the main about is really good.Video quality is amazing. Even when you're walking or driving, the video is quite stable. So really love the video stabilization.Slow motion works really fine. Only thing is in the normal video the brightness is a bit more. But in the slow motion, the video is a little bit dull.But overall the camera is really great.For the price, it's a great phone. Worth your money.\n\n", '\n\n  The phone itself is greatBut when its comes to other products in the same price range it lack so muchLet me be preciseProsCameraDisplayPretty much thats itConsSlower finger print readerProcessorSluggish UICharging time and battery lifeFor 6k mah battery the endurance time should be much more\n\n', '\n\n  cant write a review for the product quality, the ph i got just a few hours ago, already with manufacturing defect!

Currently touch screen of the cellphone is not working, with in 1.5 months, I am very disappointment with the quality of the cellphone, in this lock-down situation, How customer care team will help for replacement.As I am Samsung customer since 18 years, I would like to hear from team immanently for solution.\n\n', '\n\n  Worst camera set up. Insanely thick and cheap built. Not returning cos it was gifted to someone and am kinda embarrassed.‚Ä¢ ANCIENT CAMERA QUALITY‚Ä¢ VERY THICK‚Ä¢ CHEAP PLASTIC BUILDSeveral other options with no such FANCY/TOO PROMISING SPECS.I myself use two Galaxy Notes but now I have a different impression on SAMSUNG.\n\n', "\n\n  I haven't come across such a great camera at this cost.

But while using internet the back to portion of mobile is getting heat.The courier package also so worst. Seller has simply mobile box into the courier cover and they dispatch There is no safety covers or rappers covers this box and the courier delivery person also handling this stuff's very rudely.He simply put the bag into the ground and searching my parcel.\n\n", "\n\n  Excellent phone with all the necessary specs for a fantastic deal. I bought this at 14999. At that price I needed 4 things:a) Good processing power and RAMb) Sufficient internal memory & expansionc) Good batteryd) Good cameraI'm very happy with the first 2. I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography. The sensor is what matters and it is good enough for this price point.Some of the built-in features are good.In short, I'm happy with my purchase.\n\n", '\n\n  I also have m 30 but 31 is betterJust love this handsetBattery life- lasts extremely longer than any mobile phone even when used with pubgSound- loud and clearDisplay - greatLove the colour vry sleak and sexyCamera quality is superb... Till now it has been almost 7 months the phone is working perfectly fineAffordableFinger print reader - had no issues with that too\n\n', '\n\n  I bought this phone about a month back and it has a super annoying thing. The phone auto restarts whenever it thinks to do so. Its not a hardware issue as such, its by design. Try googling this issue for M31 and many other users are frustrated. Best part is there is no solution to it. Next problem is its too slow, it doesnt matter if it has 8 GB ram and 4.5 GB shows as free, if you just try to scroll a whatsapp chat window, or simply type a text message, first word starts to appear on the screen after you have typed entire sentence. A usual "suggestion" given by ppl is free up RAM and storage or disable  "auto-restart" in device care (which is not even enabled). My phone is almost new and i dont play games or do heavy multi tasking. Ram is never 50% utilized and storage is hardly 30 GB used out of 128 GB and yet you cannot even type a text message nicely.On the positive side, camera and battery are as expected. However, trust me, you\'ll get frustrated by its lag and restart feature.Verdict :- Its a trash.\n\n', "\n\n  Why people are going to Chinese products, just because of unable to find good products from other countries within budgetJust because to ignore Chinese products I have purchased this Samsung Galaxy m31 but not a good mobilePros:1. Battery backup (con is 3hours charging time)2. Dual sim with memory card (my favorite option)Cons:1. No full screen videos in YouTube, games,etc2. No proper gestures3. Fingerprint sensor not accurate4. Difficult to find required options5. No removable battery (if it's hung we can remove and fix the issue)6. No headphones (marketing separately from all companies)7. Not provided temporary case also( most of the Chinese companies will provide)8. Updating OS will heat mobile with very high temperatureThese are the pros and cons found in 20 days\n\n", "\n\n  As soon as I switched on the smartphone, I fell in love with its AMOLED display. It was so vivid and appealing. And the screentouch was super responsive and sensitive. It is loaded with numerous awesome features in the camera section such as super slow motion in video mode, 64 MP mode in camera will catch your whole attention and much more. The device is quite user friendly and handy. The battery backup is around 1.5 - 2 days on average phone usage. I haven't encountered any lag or malfunctioning of the device yet. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.\n\n", "\n\n  Just wowwww........Samsung is my all time favorit brand. I never use any other brand. The phone is amezing in every terms. Very good mobile. This mobile superb amolded screen, Excellent features. Touch sensitive, comfortable for handle.  Battery life is good and long lasting. Weighty due to 6000 mAh ...... Perfect for who need extra battery. 48 hours of music playback and as much as 8-10 hours of video playback. Superb battery backup.  Camera quality is superb. Micro performance is owsm.  Face reader and fingerprint sensor is very good. No new changes in display. It's look like you still using old samsung mobile. Connectivity is poor......... WiFi calling is available. Great processor.......  Overall it is good. After using it I am satisfied and happy. At last I say that it is value for monay product.\n\n", "\n\n  Well I wasn't too sure when others mentioned seeing dust around the packaged product but to my surprise I had similar experience. The phone had dust particle all around it. On top of that the package did not have even sim card ejector. I am deeply disappointed for that fact that I had to give it 1 star just because of its poor packaging and not so good first experience. In fact its sim card tray is so fragile that I am really afraid to push it even with moderate force.Cannot say much about the product quality as I am yet to experience it.\n\n", "\n\n  This is after a couple of weeks of usage.Overall, I like the device. Few things that needs improvement.1. The screen: Due to lockdown, I haven't been able to get a tempered glass. But that is no excuse for seeing the scratches on the screen. The phone hasn't fallen even once since I got it, but I see several scrathes on the screen. How poor is the glass quality?2. The fingerprint sensor is a dud. Only after repeated attempts does the phone unlock. Maybe work on it before manufacturing the newer stock.It is a great phone in it's price range but just because you are decreasing the price, doesn't mean you can compromise on the quality. Because if it does, there is no point marketing cheaper models if they are substandard.\n\n", "\n\n  Display glass quality is very poor(not the AMOLED). It just cracked and stopped working after accidentally dropping from 1 ft.And Samsung service centre asks hell lot of money to repair(1/3 of mobile price) and taking lot of time (1-2weeks) to fix.If you buy this phone make sure you don't drop.\n\n", "\n\n  Now firstly for the pubg lovers I would like to tell you that it easily runs pubg at HDR ultra settings of graphics with no lag you just need to activate performance mode which obviously uses more battery give best performance.The phone has three battery modes by default it will be in performance mode ,( takes as much juice possible from your battery to handle your heavy tasks, multitasking, etc. And once you it last easily 2 days. Cameras are awesome it's a bit warmer and soft images but details are amazing and other colours.....Guys literally there are loads of features and don't want to write an essay over here it will be tedious for you all to read....Trust me I'm using it as my daily driver and had no issues ya it may not have 90Hzs but who needs it in day to day budget life. Don't think just go for it and you enjoy it phone ...... #bestbudgetphone...\n\n", '\n\n  disappointed.Battery is big but useless. My phone dint last even for whole daytime with full charge with normal uses.Camera is below par. You could get better camera in less adevertized phones.The biggest negative is its microphone and speakers. I had to return the phone because of it. Very low sound output and microphone is horrible.Though the phone has super amoled screen, the colours looks like you are watching a CRT monitor TV.So Disappointing that I dint even use the phone for 2 days and returned.Never reccomend it to anyone.\n\n', "\n\n  I upgraded from a 4 year old samsung. So as soon as I got hands on experience with this phone, I was amazed by how smooth the experience was.Samsung has moved onto the budget phone market and has established an elegant line of phones.Pros: - The finger print sensor is fast and very responsive - The battery lasts a good 2 days. - Faster compared to other budget phones in the 15k~ range - The build quality is nice - Despite the size, it's a very light phoneCons: - Battery takes 3 hours to charge completely - Even though it has a nice back, it is prone to fingerprints, and scratches - Thicker than normal\n\n", '\n\n  The phone has amazing camera and battery.

It works even better if in the night one puts it on battery saver mode.Build - The phone build looks rugged. Its back is very smooth so feels like it will slip off the hand. The thickness is slightly more but its a compromise for the large battery it holds.Camera - the output is really good and crisp. Photo quality and videos quality is nice.Sound - The phone has one speaker, but sound quality is really decent.Cards - it has dedicated slots for 2 SIMs and a memory card. But with 128GB one would not need much !I have eventually bought 4 of these for within the family and noticed some build issue. On the back camera, I observed that camera slot should be slightly out of the body. But when I checked one phone, I saw that the level was merged with the back cover. That is a concern for me. With this, I actually noticed the same on the other phones and realised that the back cover needs to be pressed a little to allow the camera slot to pop out.Now I am afraid that this could be manufacturing defect.I also had a passing comment from one of the amazon delivery guys that the phone is the most commonly returned phones these days. But thankfully it is not for us for the moment.\n\n', "\n\n  Pleset don't buyThis is wrost mobile phone ever1.Some YouTuber says it is high durability phone but I used this very weak durability phone2.Camera is very poor 64mp is just no.Game3.Battery take too much time to fullcharge4.After some time heating and hang problem occur5.After 4month I sold this phone very low price\n\n", '\n\n  This fingerprint reader is faster then my last mobile, and much more fast then in screen fingerpring.The camara quality is good, and took nice portrait shorts.(here I uploaded some pics for m31)And I really like the display and build, although I had 6000 may battery weight distribution is evenReally enjoying 6000mah battery, it gets more then 1 day of Battery life and 10Hrs of ScreenOn time,Even flagships like S20,note 10, OnePlus, iPhone doesn\'t get this battery life (they get around 5-7hrs approx)If it gets a fast charger in the box it could be much more easy to charge massive battryIf u are not a power user or a heavy gamer, this is a perfect buyMainly elders dont use heavy apps or games, if they use it in battery saver mode, it can easily get 2 days of battery life for them.Note**One of the Main reason to buy is Samsung security feature, if Ur cell is lost you track it with Samsung website immediately (if net is on), and "NOBODY CAN SWITCH OFF" your mobile unit they have Ur Password or patternI think this review helpfulThank you.......\n\n', "\n\n  In short Don't buy it.The battery life & charging time is pathetic. It takes more than 3 hours to get the battery charged full. The battery even doesn't go for 1 day, with the medium usage.

My previous used to run around 30 hours.I checked all the inbuild application to check my device health, It was all ok. So, I thought it my be battery issue.

Also on this phone the network bar for vodafone network shows only 2 lines whereas on my other mobile it shows full network of vodafone. Worst phone . I suggest people not to go for this phone.

Battery normally  last generally almost 2 days after moderate to high uses. Fingerprint reader work well. Display is very attractive, cool and good for eyes while using this phone in night. It is very good while seeing movies in prime, YouTube etc. Phone is very lightweight for carrying in pocket. Phone is not hanging during as Samsung  previous phone had this issue. Some people complained about heating issue during long call or heavy uses. As I am not a very heavy phone user still I have found no issue about heating . While some heating issue was observe during charging but it's very common. No heating issue observed while calling. Sound quality is good but not loud as generally  observed for other Chinese smartphone. Memory is 6 GB ram and 128 GB internal memory. But most bloatware apps are given in this smartphone. But memory is enough for those whom which like installing  gaming app or heavy application. Camera quality is very awesome.

Really amazing...Just some minor issues: it doesn't have Knox security, its plastic back can easily invite scratches, Samsung could have improved the charging quality and its processor too and it doesn't have a screen recording feature or link to windows feature. The 32mp front camera is not good as good as expected it gives you the quality of a 15 to 20mp camera.It really has a super battery life, very nice rear quad camera with plenty of new features, amazing display, the fingerprint sensor and the face unlock is superfast and it gives you a nice performance.Hope you find this helpful.\n\n", '\n\n  What I am impressed is the camera quality in night time.

Moreover Amazon allowed me to exchange my old phone that brought the price of the phone in my budget. Thanks.Many customizable features for dark mode, blue light, game recording etc are best.On the downside. You will feel lack of snapdragon processor during heavy gaming. Otherwise I would have given 5 star.\n\n', "\n\n  What I Like on M31(30days Review)Value for Money ProductSamsung One UI 2.0 (best UI among all UI's)6.4 inch, 403 PPI, Super AMOLED display (Best for Always on display, Best for Black, also helps saving battery as black pixels are not lit).Battery 6000 mAh(Amazing Battery Backup, Lasts almost 1.5 days for even an heavy user like me).Camera 64 MP Back/32 MP Front (I have attached sample photos).No heating issues at all in 30 days usage.What I don't Like isNot able to upgrade to 2.1 One UIExynos dosen't support GcamFast changing with15W is very slow takes approx 2 hours to get fully charged.\n\n", "\n\n  After 3days of usage my view points;I'm not a gamer my previous phone was Realme1 for me this is definitely a worthy upgrade .Phone UI looks more better and standard compared to Color os  And looks stunning .For me battery last approximately 2days , but not justified 6000mah expected much better performance , but got a very good battery life.Camera department neither good or bad,  it didn't justified its 64mp camera , over saturated images , and video poor performance in low light condition. In night camera seems horrible.In Audio department M31 inferior to Realme 1 , m31 lack its sound quality and also bluetooth codec Ldac .But decent audio output guaranteed.Pros;BatteryDisplayWidevine L1FingerprintDolbyCamera (in good lighting)One UI (No so much junks, Very clean compared to Realme UI&MI UI)Cons;Low light photography horribleVideo shootNo caseBattery optimizationLack of LdacSecurity patch### Rised Replacement request  , phone switchoff frequently  ,\n\n", "\n\n  Device is overall good, But I must say that camera quality is not upto the level I was expecting it being a 64MP camera phone.Front camera photography is a not good in dark and images appear very grainy. Talking about image processing Colors are oversaturated and during video calls you could see a yellow tint. This underperformance of the front camera is because of the notch design as there is less space in the front for another camera/ flash.The rear camera is somewhat good in photography and and the videography is pretty good.BloatwaresWith this phone Samsung has targeted the  budget phone section as they were falling behind the likes of other Chinese manufacturers. Though they have packed this phone with massive features but it comes with  a trade off i.e. Bloatwares and sponsored app downloads. If you are wise enough to bypass those app promotions you can happily use this phone.Overall, I am satisfied with the phone because I didn't want to go for Chinese companies. But still I miss Good front camera.\n\n", '\n\n  Yes,its the best of its kind its been 3days since its arrival and i loved it,. Has many good features and display clarity is amazing..but i dont get the feel of 8GB even  though..customercare is awesome they r there for u evrytime so if u hav any suggestions or queries  abt the product u can right away ask with the help of samsung member  app in it.finger print reader is good,cam is also good,battery depends on how u use it..on standby mode with data on ,it can last around 2days max,and it has a premium  look,evn though its made frm plastic case...\n\n', '\n\n  \xa0Worst product.Camera performance is below average.I received a defective product and when asked for replacement, they performed a smartcheck and said everything is fine.Whenever I make a video call the other person is not able to hear properly.I have checked by putting the same sim card on a different mobile and used the same app to video call(WhatsApp) which was fine. When I complained on the video quality, I was told to use super steady mode.I have attached a video  shooted in super steady in the same mobile which was like the old video cassette we use to watch during 90s.Do check that before you invest your money in this smartphone.\n\n', '\n\n  I buyed phone on sale day 2 and received next day that , what I liked about the phone is battery Backup and Camera features rest things are pretty common like other competitors phone. Software is much better and impressive display in this segment.Cons:Volume is very low on callFace recognition  could be improvedLags and gets little heat up while heavy gamimg.Fast charging is not fast may be because of bigger battery 6000mah\n\n', "\n\n  Pros and Cons compare to other mobiles in the same budgetPros.1. Awesome Display2. Battery Excellent3. Build quality is OK4. Camera (both front and back) is good ( not comparing with flagship mobile cams )5. Speaker sound quality is decent6. One UI is OK but it could have been better7. Processor is good and with 6GB RAM it's performance is smoothCons.1. No back cover out of the box.2. 15w charger is enough for 6000mah battery3. Camera (both front and back) in low light is not up to the mark4. There are few issue with software for example, sometimes unable to send SMS, Samsung customer took remote access but unable to find reason.hope these software issues will be fixed soon with future updatesOver all - it is a value for money.\n\n", "\n\n  Highly regret buying this phone. 2 very major problems:1) The range on 4g network is very poor. When any other phone has full range on 4g, M31 kept just besides it has only 1 line of range. And this is not just with this handset, but a very common problem. Google this issue and you will come across hundreds on people complaining about this on Samsung's page.Well, due to this, even internet and calls don't work properly. So the phone gets reduced to a camera basically.2) The fingerprint sensor needs atleast 3-4 attempts to open. Having used Redmi which needs just a fraction of second to open, this is a nightmare. Painful.Very much regret buying this.\n\n", "\n\n  My previous phone had a cracked LCD and was on the lookout for a new phone. Thanks to the lockdown, had lots of time on my hand to review most phones, get firsthand accounts from friends and then make a choice.To be honest, my first preference was the OP8 and was looking for video reviews when I stumbled upon this phone. Samsung seems to have packaged a decent bit of hardware and specifications on this phone which gets most of your job done.Disclaimer: If you are an avid gamer, then this is not for you unless you are ready to make trade offsWhat I Like the most:1. Comes with Android one UI v2. The phone has a near bloat free experience and very close to stock android. However, some of the features are masked by Samsung, I'm if those will be available in higher end or flagship models like S20 / S20 Note etc. However, loving the features like Dark mode, use Camera flash for notification, ability to capture more than one face etc.2. Amazing display, the AmOLED display is a pleasure to view and even can be used under direct sunlight.3. The phone comes with support for two sims and SD card, which is good for avid music lovers like me to stash and carry my ever-growing collection of music & videos.4. Samsung switch App, for once I have a product from Samsung which does the job without any fuzz. Was able to transfer my data from my broken phone using this.5. The Camera is of decent quality, so far, the pictures have turned out well, but still exploring so will reserve my comments for now.What I don‚Äôt like1. 6000 MAH battery adds to the weight but gives the same performance as my old phone 4000 MAH battery. Could have tweaked battery usage2. The build is dated, and the naked phone may not draw any oohs & aahs from onlookers. Plastic body is prone to scratches and fingerprints, so better invest in a case.3. No headphones provided by Samsung, not sure if this is the trend, but a simple 100 Rs earphone could have enhanced the VFM perspective.4. Lastly the Exynos processor, so far, I‚Äôve not notices any lag or slowness, but at times I feel that the phone is a tad unresponsive especially when I try to pull down the notification panel or try to dismiss a few apps.Overall Verdict:It‚Äôs a bargain buy with good specifications, recommend purchasing this.\n\n", '\n\n  Serves all our purpose . At the mid range is one of the better phones. Has an impressive baterry life. The camera at night shots (low lights) could have been better (this an area for improvement ). For regular use,  mild gaming (not graphic intensive) we did not face any lag. Amoled display is good, we felt it better than the M30. Overall satisfied with the phone.\n\n', '\n\n  Defective, first day problem of hanging and heating, even smaller apps not fully functional including social apps of daily use\n\n', '\n\n  The best ever decision qas to purchase this budget Smart phone with extraordinary battery capacity.I have never expected the amazing Performance of Samsung phones of this price range.The performance of this phone is ultimate matching near to its S series phones.Battery is awesome...its range for me is 18hrs in one charge.Camera performance is out standing.Fingerprint is instant.Overall best offer by Samsung.Thanks to Samsung for launching such a wonderful budget Smart phone.\n\n', "\n\n  Device performance is average... No lag, smooth performance...having little bit heating issue...But most disadvantage is camera quality...worse camera performance I ever experienced... Snaps looks like taken from 2 mp ..there is front flash.. you can't able to use 64 mp inbuilt camera every time..ever 64 mp camera snaps quality is worth...when video stabilisation , wide angle or other camere options then 64mp shot will not work..and snaps quality become pathetic.... Today's in this range around 16000rs we will easily get a good performance mobile phone with excellent camera...This phone looks dull also... I have wasted my money  please don't waste yours..üôèüôè\n\n", '\n\n  After a months use I will highly recommend this phone to all heavy users. The camera and battery are two of the best pros to buy this mega monster. Screen is awesome and clearly visible in bright sunlight. One very important benefit is that when you connect the phone to computer for taking photos or files from your phone, its very easy to find the files or photos from phone memory, whereas its a nightmare to find your data on most of the Chinese brands. Its the best option out there, so dont try any other Chinese phones but buy Samsung Galaxy M31.\n\n', "\n\n  I really like the camera. The battery life was very good .It took me around 2 days to completely discharge the battery.The amoled screen was like cherry on the top of cake .They only complain I have is there is a minor lag in viewing the picture after taking a snap .It takes a pause of 2-3 sec which was bit unusual for me because  the phone performance was very good and  It is very fast . The other thing is there is no stabilization in macro mode and the night mode is pretty good  (it's  not very good ).Ignoring these minor defects  ...the phone is all in all very good .I'm satisfied  with it.The delivery by Amazon was fast and the phone was neatly  packed .\n\n", "\n\n  I have purchased this mobile from Amazon on 3rd August 2020. After using this phone for 19 days now phone has got hanged and screen is not working. I have contacted Samsung Service Centre and they informed to visit nearest Authorized service centre. After introspection of the phone Service Centre representative told that screen needs to be changed and it will take around 10-15 days. This is pathetic from global brand like Samsung. At the service centre I noticed that there were other customers who were facing the same issue.Pathetic phone from Samsung.Don't buy this handset.\n\n", "\n\n  camera quality is excellent even better than other branded Mobiles and sound quality is awesome...moreover the battery capacity is great,the phone never gets overheated while charging...the big AMOLED display of the mobile neverallows me to leave it without watching videos...I am in love with this mobile...it is perfect those who want a good mobile under Rs.20000 .Very cool phone,Who says Exynos 9611 is a bad soc , i even have poco x2 but if you play COD and PUBG oh gosh on  730g cod just crashed???? Even on 120hz .and this m31,avery good boy he survived 2 hrs without a crash and then i stopped playing.64mp oh wow its better than poco x2's 64 sony IM686 sensor and even flagship mobiles prove 2mp macro but m31 provided 5mpüëç It even records 4k in selfie no phone can do that in this range even m31 ll win if u compare this with flagship phones.. Blindly go for m31, you won‚Äôt regret..\n\n", "\n\n  Being an iPhone user for 4 years, I was skeptical about switching to Android. Yet, the Samsung M31 got my attention right at the moment I saw it on Amazon.And it has surpassed all my expectations and more. I've never been this satisfied with a phone's performance at this price range.It is absolutely amazing in all aspects from camera to battery. Performance is smooth. I'm not a gamer but occasional PUBG was a lag free experience.Overall, this is the best you can get for 17K right now.\n\n", '\n\n  M31 is equipped with all the features what one wish to have in mobile. After reviewing all makes and comparison, I choose to have M31 and I must say, my decision was not wrong. Amazon delivered the product before their committed date. 6gb Ram, 128gb Storage, Octa core, 64MP quad Camera is more than enough. Functional Performance is very good. 6000mah Battery performance is too good. No need to charge even for next day. Camera also delivers good picture quality throughout day and night. Sensors like Biometric & Compass are very useful. I am truly enjoying M31. Samsung has indeed done a great job by launching M series compared to other make mobiles at very competitive price.\n\n', "\n\n  Camera domain is not a great piece here. My other device Asus 5Z performs well with 8mp than this 64mp shooter. Samsung should develop this camera's performance asap.Battery is fantastic. Gets thru 2 days easily.UI & moderate multitasking is smooth.Hardware is well built and feels sturdy.But still, added protection of screen guard and case is must.\n\n", "\n\n  Remember:* Galaxy M series phones don't have Knox security, so you won't get features like Secure folder, Samsung Pass, Samsung Pay, and other Knox-dependent services.* Galaxy M series phones run One UI 'Core', so features like Good Lock, Bixby are not compatible.* Samsung phones generally struggle in network reception in areas where coverage is poor. If there's strong network coverage, then you won't notice any difference.Otherwise, it's a decent phone for at around 15k.\n\n", '\n\n  Pros:1. Great battery life. Reminiscent of the old nokia phones which never used to die.2. High quality display.3. Smooth and fluid performance.Cons:1. Fingerprint reader non-responsive sometimes2. Camera quality is only decent. Pro mode does not give much options like ability to adjust aperture and shutter speed. Maybe you can get access to those from some other app in the play store.3. Touch unlock available but not touch lock which could lengthen the life of the power button. Again have to depend on some play store app for this.Overall a great buy for anyone looking for fair performance and good battery life.\n\n', '\n\n  This phone is really a Mega monsterPros:- Android 10 (very fast and feels light while operating)- Stunning Display with Blue light filter (i always use the filter )- 4K video recording  UHD video 3840x2160.- 6 GB Ram enough to play most of the games- 6000 Mah battery is enough to get you through the day- Storage 128 GB (If you record 4k videos you need to get a memory card )- Fast charging with 15W brick (could have been faster but OK)- Mobile speakers sound is OK ( but not loud enough)- Camera is really good with 64 mp back and 32mp front- fingerprint sensor response is ok ( with sweaty hands you have to struggle)Cons:- Recording video with flash on the phone over heated and restarted with a message "your phone is over heating" (if thats a feature form Android 10 its okey to save the hardware)- you cannot zoom in or out in most camera modes (hope those can be fixed with an update)- no gestures to bring torch without unlocking phone (my previous phone has a dedicated music key which i assigned to torch)FeedbackA well built phone with good featuresI am happy I bought this phone :)\n\n', '\n\n  - Has 6000 mh battery but stand by time is very poor- Does not support volte or you can not access internet when you are on call.- Manual selection of operator does not stick, will move to automatic when you put it to airplan mode.- No compete 4G option in SIM card settings- charging speed is not as expected- touch is good- quality of the camera is satisfactoryCan go for it, if amazon releases it between 10 - 13 k\n\n', '\n\n  For the price this phone exceeds and performance is really great. Battery life is worth mentioning could go without charging for two days. Finger print reader is just great no hassles. Camera quality I found very good,  though professional reviewers mentioned low on low light, I found it otherwise, as it takes good pictures without any issues focus is not lost, flash is powerful enough to take those pics in absolute dark.I recommend anyone to buy the phone just closing their eyes. For price tag of 17K it is simply awesome no need to invest 25k, 35k for smartphone as it gives more features for the price of 17K\n\n', "\n\n  Review after 4 days usage:The phone is very good in terms of what it offers for 16 thousand mid range segment. Pros,cons and final verdict below.Pros:1. Camera is solid. Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah3. Display is crisp and very sensitive4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.Cons:1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung\n\n", "\n\n  I am a Samsung loyalist and upgraded from Galaxy A4 2017, my reliable workhorse. The new phone tries to be intuitive, many options for customization. BUT sound was v bad. Could not listen to music till I googled and added Samsung music app. Had to tweak sound for 60+ which I'm not, to hear phone calls. So many bells and whistles but Samsung forgot SOUND,  the basic.\n\n", '\n\n  Brought M31 128 gb variant . Phone looks great and display really nice. But battery  life is not seems to be like 6000mah . For simple usage YouTube videos,online songs- battery drains fast  .  I was using lg w30 as temporary mobile (3000mah)I feel that mobile backup was good.After some day will update my comments if any changes\n\n', '\n\n  A SMALL REQUEST TO YOU DONT BUY THIS PHONE I AM THE REGULAR CUSTOMER OF SAMSUNG BUT NOW I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT SAMSUNG I  AM NOT HAPPY TO THIS PHONE\n\n', "\n\n  Giving review after Using it for two days.  Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.Pros-1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.Average features-1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.Cons-1. No cover provided within the box.2. No headphones provided.3. No Samsung secure folder.4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. üëç\n\n", '\n\n  I bought the Samsung M31 6GB 128GB version for 16k. I use mostly online shopping apps, Streaming apps, chat, video calls.Pros1. SAMOLED screen, Pleasing to look....2. Battery life, for me with moderate use it lasts for 2 days.3. Camera Front and Back. Especially I love the Front camera...For selfie lovers it is a boon. Back camera is good but I can spot some color deviations in pictures taken using back camera as the real color is not seen in picture. But for me it is not an issue as I not using it frequently.4. Stylish looks.5. No major heating issues as I could see persons having competitors mobiles are complaining a lot about this.6. Even after 20 to 30 drops I dont see any visible even minor damage to the screen or body. Very well built device.Cons,1. Finger peint sensor and face recognition takes bit longer time then competitors devices to detect.2. Plastic body behind is fingerprint magnet and also can be easily scratched with out case. I dont like using a case so it is a issue for me.Even if you use a case you have to choose a good quality one as the bad ones themselves leave some scratches in long use3. Charging time...I know it is directly proportional to battery capacity but bit more faster charging would have been handy. Tome charging times are 3 hours 15 mins with normal charging and 2 hours 35 mins with fast charging.4. Whenever there is a software update mobile also shows a list of recommended apps that should be installed to complete the update. This came skipped but still it is annoying.Gamers.. please forgive me as I am not going to mention anything regarding the gaming performance as I have never tried even a single game with this mobile.Mobile is worth the money and my Rating is easily above 4 but if metal case and bit more faster charging options are provided I will be happily rate it 5.Thanks for the patience to read the complete review.\n\n', "\n\n  Alert: This will be very common man review not a technical one so if you are looking for technical review kindly skip it.Samsung M 31 has been great buy owing to its monster battery  life. I am a new mom and purchased this mobile  when my infant was 2 months  old. The battery lasts pretty long even after playing multiple YouTube videos and being on long video calls (due to lockdown). I don't get time charge my phone properly though.Sound quality: The sound is loud and clear over calls and also during entertainment sessions of movies and video.Camera Quality: The reason I opted  this phone was I wanted  good camera to capture precious moments of my little one. So far it has been serving  the purpose. I can't comment for outdoor photography as we are all home bound owing to pandemic.Screen: The display colours and picture resolution is great owing to full HD Amoled Display. But Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is my savior as my mobile has been kicked and slipped multiple times (I am using it without a screen guard and back cover). Further  the Accidental Touch feature is awesome as I mostly  have an infant in hand while using the mobile.Body: The body is non slippery offering good grip but there will lot of finger impression left on back.Fingerprint Sensor: Only thing that doesn't  pleases me its fingerprint sensor quality which could have been better. It takes times sometimes  or I have place finger multiple times.Face recognition features works well for me and it unlocks the phone from various angles even when I am using spectacles( this becomes a problem in various other mobiles.)Overall I am happy  with the purchase so far after two months of use.\n\n", '\n\n  After using it I find out that there is a network issue.

I was using the Oneplus 7T before. I am not a heavy gamer and use my device to binge-watch, click photos and use the social media apps so won't comment much on the performance. The camera to my surprise almost competed with 7T's even though it's half of it's price point.Pros:1. Camera - I find the camera to be pretty good at this price point. Both the front and back cameras have good depth. The macro camera could be a bit better but does the job for a budget smart phone. I have attached photos I clicked (clearly not a good photographer), the first is of a odd little spider using the macro camera, the 2nd and 3rd of the 64 MP camera and the 4th of the front camera2. Amoled display3. The battery life lasts for the full day easily even though I use my phone at long stretches.4. 2 sim card and an separate sd card holder - I am one of those people who watches a lot of classic movies and hence need the extra storage so this bodes well for me and I also have 2 phone numbers (work cell and personal cell)5. Not a Chinese brand.Cons-1. It's on the heavier side understandably with the 6000 mah battery2. The charger should have been at least of 25 amperes.

I had read a similar review on Amazon about getting dust under plastic cover.Initially I suspected the cameras of the phone and the camera panel seems to be slightly displaced. Camera quality is the worst. My friend has the same phone but he's camera is good. I suspect that the original parts of this phone that I've received are siphoned. please please don't buy this phone from Amazon. They've got the worst retailers. Regretting buying this phone. The fingerprint sensor has stopped working. In just 2 months. The original parts of this phone have been removed. Like cameras and fingerprint sensor and speakers. Can't believe this. Couldn't return the phone as I didn't use it until a month after ordering.Also the face unlock feature doesn't work properly.\n\n", "\n\n  It's been a week that I bought my new Samsung galaxy M31 and gonna give a review on my experience.ProsCamera is just too awesome but I think these days many competitor phones have good camera quality.Battery goes more than 24hrs, I use comparatively less than an insta/fb/Twitter person, but more often I keep checking messages and few videos. With full charging, it says low battery after some 30 hours, so battery life is real great.ConsBut charging takes long time. Adapter has the Fast Charging sign, but to make us fool. It take around 2 hours for full charging which I feel is really long.Processor being Exynos and 6GB Ram, I feel the performance is quite poor. Phone is slow in operation. Not satisfying.Fingerprint sensor ain't that great. Sometimes fails to detect my finger and sometimes takes time.\n\n", "\n\n  \xa0The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support.I'm giving this review after using 1 week.Pros:Camera : The Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup at the back and a single 32-megapixel selfie shooter. The primary camera on the Galaxy M31 has a 64-megapixel resolution and f/1.8 aperture. This camera takes 16-megapixel binned shots by default but you can switch to the full resolution. There's also an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree field of view and an f/2.2 aperture.Battery : I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again. 2.5 hours to full chrage.Games:If you are a professional gamer, I suggest you to go for MI brand. MI provides slightly better graphics. Overall gaming experience is nice on M31Cons:Nothing as of now.  Note : When I plugged into charging phone will slightly heatup.I bought it 2  Phones as 6GB and 8GB with 128GB storage.\n\n", "\n\n  Battery: I play games such scrabble go, Jurassic park, and few others. And often use my phone to read.Before this I had Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 (5000 mah).  Comparing the two with same amount of activity, I found Samsung Galaxy M31's 6000 mah lacking.I have seen a lot of complains about the the camera clarity and the battery.Camera: The camera is pretty decent. Includes, slow motion, super slow motion, hyper lapse, macro, etc.But don't put on blinders, purchase this phone with the knowledge that the battery isn't up to the mark.\n\n", "\n\n  This is the best phone that I was able to find with comes with a brand guarantee.. I mean I get it mi and other brands are putting alot of effort but their is a reason samsung is doing the best. The quality of the phone doesn't feel cheap it's fells like the money you paid for. The phone fit just quite right in my hands and was easy and smooth to handle... The fucntions were great and finger print was quick. Also, the camera is fantastic which gives you the absolute focus and it's endless camera features just adds up to its charm\n\n", '\n\n  I have been using samsung galaxy m31 since last 6 months and i can say that this is one of the best option to have a perfect smartphone at this price range....Pros1. Display is great with AMOLED2. Camera is top class3. Usability and screen touch is quite smooth4. fingerprint works best5. Battery is really a monster and can easily survive for at least 35 to 40 hrs..6. RAM and memory management is done pretty well on thisCons1. Exynos 9611 processor which not quite suitable for gamers but i dont complain personally2. Should have given fast charger considering its battery capacity as it takes around 2 hours 35 min approx to charge fully3. Initially i did faced some issues with device restart but then with some seetings of optimization, its working pretty well..I would definitely recommend this device to users who use smartphones for day to day use except heavy gamers...pleasedo check attached images for camera quality...ThanksGovardhan.\n\n', '\n\n  A very awesome mobile, a complete  value for money.Main highlights are its awesome display, battery and performance.One can argue with the performance when u take gaming into account.

Camera pic output...some are good some are not natural, its seems artificial.2. No fast charging support..it takes nearly 2hr 45 mins to charge it completely.These are not major negatives about this phone if compare at the price its been offered.GO AHEAD FOR IT.....üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç\n\n', '\n\n  Good mobile at 15-16k.Good battery,Good soundRear Camera good but not like 64 mpFront camera good but not seems like 32 mp.Heavy in weight as battery is hugeDisplay is goodPortrait mode of camera is goodBattery backup is greatOverall  good.....\n\n', "\n\n  1.Style outdated2.

Selfie camera is thumbs up.Baterry life was the primary thing i went for and in this range this battery pickup is great.The touchscreen, smooth touch, sleek and classy look is more than the price.No heating problem, no hanging problem, bit of network connectivity problem probably due to the operator.I would have given 4 straightaway. But .5 is to be added for the low price range and .5 is to be cut for the not so 64 camera quality.

Quite happy with the performance over the last two weeks or so.Overall, a value for money phone. Is Made in India, too. You should consider for phones under rs.20,000.I decided to buy this phone after quiite a lot of research. And Im quite happy with the decision.  Hope this helps.\n\n', '\n\n  I would say this is a better phone as compare to Redmi note 9 pro max. The reason is very subjective but I will try to answer few of them.The first and foremost is the premium look and feel of this phone which is unlike the Redmi note 9 pro max. The next is the camera quality it‚Äôs really outperform as compare to anything which rate me as to offer. Next the overall hamlet screen over here is much better as compare to redmi note 9 pro max.Lastly it all depends on how much you have to spend on a given phone but having a Samsung phone can always give you assurance that it will last long at least an year or two more as compare to any other brand.\n\n', "\n\n  This phone is bizzare.PROSProcessor is fine.Design feels solid and the phone is good to hold in hand.The UI is also quite good.The camera is 64mp and won't fail you.The selfie camera is 32mp and is pretty good.Pubg does not lag and runs smoothly.The sAMOLED display is the highlight of the phone.CONSThe phone has bloatware.The finger sensor is on the back. I would have preferred an onscreen one or on the power button in this price range.The phone is thicker than the A series.I am not a fan of notch and would have preferred a punch hole instead.\n\n", '\n\n  When you run apps, the screen display gets crammed, one line sits over another and not legible.Otp screens are a problem, it does not clearly come out and you cannot do a proper bank transaction through third party apps which call the merchant banking system.E.g. Uber/Zomato orders/payments call merchant banking and needs otp validation. You never can do it on M31. Otp screen goes in the background.Finally end up paying everything in cash.Worst mobile and not worth the money you spent.\n\n', '\n\n  This phone is good but the problem is that it heats during charging..... and everything is ok\n\n', '\n\n  Battery Life Its good but not as expected , I am not a heavy user, not a gamer, but it need to be charge once in a day, and it took 1:30 hrs to get it charge completelyFingerprint Sensor is Good 4/5Camera Quality is good no complaintsBig disappointment is Dolby Sound which is of no use, you on it or off it there is not much difference\n\n', '\n\n  Phone is good and for this much money it is value for money.Hangs quite a lot while playing graphics game like COD. Front camera is not good but Rear one is really good and captures images with good quality.Battery backup is ok type not so good although this is 6k mah phone.UI is awesome and quite yser friendly. RAM is not so good and I found no difference in performance with 4 gb RAM.\n\n', '\n\n  It\'s been just 3 weeks since i bought this phone.When it comes to midrange models samsung has always been a good choice.Its performance and other features are always been decent.Galaxy M31 has some of the good features too.The First and the best thing about this phone is its display.Its 6.4" super amoled display is awesome! Touch experience is butter smooth.If you watch lot of movies & videos then this phone is a right choice for you.Bcoz I watch lot of movies so its display quality is really great!It has a massive 6000mah battery which gives you a good battery life. I used to watch offline movies without break for more than 2 hours but the charge only decreases 10%.I think it\'s really great! But if you are using social media and play games a lot or surfing internet for a long time then it gives you a decent battery life of 1 day or less.This is not for heavy gamers.Pls keep in my mind the charging time is too long.It charges only 34% in 1 hour.So it surely takes 2 and half hours to charge from 0 to100%.Even though they have given an Adaptive Fast Charger it charges slowly.Due to its heavy battery and 8.9mm thickness I thought it would be bulky but surprisingly it doesn\'t feel heavy or bulky in hand.Thanks to its curvy finish.Cellular call quality is good.It has a single Speaker which is loud and audible.Sound through ear phone also really good.Camera takes decent photos.It has got wide angle and macro too.I have posted some sample shots here .Color Saturation is good.Camera has some more features which I haven\'t used it yet.Selfie camera is good. When it comes to performance I would say it\'s not bad at all.I haven\'t seen any stutter or lag so far.Gaming performance is also good.I am not a fan of PUBG so I haven\'t installed it.I have Real Racing 2 which played really good without any lag. Some of them has said in their review that the phone has some heating issues but in my experience the phone doesn\'t heat much while playing games or watching movies or doing any other task.It gets heat while charging but it\'s normal I think.In this price range you can get lot of other brands with very good spec.But at the end of the day its SAMSUNG.Due to its brand value the pricing is high for this specs.So finally its user\'s choice to go for what they wish.Overall the phone is good in all aspect.\n\n', "\n\n  Beautiful screen with vibrant colours and a wonderful battery life is all I needed and Samsung galaxy delivers it to the dot. No compromises there on the humongous 6000 all day long or should I say all 2 days long battery. And the screen is brilliant with popping colours and eligible under sun.The blacks are deep as it should be on an amoled. Decent gaming is welcome. And the camera is no slouch the quad cam setup comes up with the best of modes. So when you go online with your pictures you don't feel bad at all. Camera has been done rightly. When you can watch Netflix in Full HD there are not a lot of phones providing this option in this segment.\n\n", '\n\n  I have ordered this mobile on 20/07/2020 and got delivery on time i.e. 24/07/2020. I have chosen M31, 8 Gb RAM version. Earlier I have used Motorola mobiles (which are good and rugged one) and this is my first Samsung mobile and I think I have made a good decision. Rest time will tell in long term use but first impression is great.So list of Positive points:1. Battery is very of good rating 6000 mAh. i do cycle rides using strava which uses GPS continually and to my surprise after using strava app for nearly 5 and half hour which include clicking photos dropped battery level from 100 % to 75% only. Which I think is very genuine.2. Processor is fast and efficient with almost no lag.3. Camera is definitely a plus point of this mobile. It will not disappoint you.4. RAM size is good as per today‚Äôs usage and I have opted for 8 Gb RAM so that in future after updates no issue arises. Other wise 6 Gb is also fine if you are going out of budget. (Here I want to mention that I am not a mobile gamer)5. Super amoled screen by Samsung is just awesome.6. User interface is very good with many good options and it will enhance core android experience. You can uninstall or hide default apps that you do not like on your mobile.7. Internal Memory is enough i.e. 128 Gb over that you get a dedicated micro SD card slot so that is impressive.8. Finger print sensor works very fast and efficiently.Now coming to negative points from my point of view1. Volume of loud speaker is bit less. If finger or something else comes over speaker it reduces volume drastically.One neutral point is that it comes with a battery charger of 15 watts only which is bit low for 6000 mAh battery but at same time very fast charging is not good for life of battery. May be Samsung engineers did what is best for their product.Final words "It‚Äôs a good mid range mobile by Samsung with impressive performance‚Äù\n\n', "\n\n  DISLIKES:I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product  Defects:No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:-headphone audioJack not working-caller audio receiver not working-speaker not workingVideos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2√ó speed.Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.LIKES:Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.WHO can Buy:-Camera is priority-Wants some bigger battery-day to day regular usage-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wiselyPHONE WONT' SATISFY:-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.-onscreen finger print sensor-A51Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.For this price,this is a real mega monster.REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer'süòÅ\n\n", "\n\n  This is my 3rd phone in Galaxy series. Galaxy series from Samsung is widely known for great phones with great features, but this one M31, is great even from Budget point of view. I did purchase on First Day First Show, when this was launched. Reason is number of reviews I had read on YouTube. Almost 20+ reviews I checked. I also read number of issues on Samsung forum / various blogs/forum etc. Every piece of information convinced, this is the best phone in this budget. Extreme value for Money.My smartphone journey has been quiet diverse in terms of various companies, so I am able to compare / differentiate various features, with hands on experience.From Year 2012 : Samsung Galaxy S2 > HTC Incredible 2 > HTC Rhyme > Samsung Galaxy Note 2 > LG G Vista > LG G6 > Redmi Note 3 > LG Q6 > Redmi Pro 6 > Samsung M31 : To year 2020.Following is my experience with M31, after a month of usage.Good: (for M31)- Android 10! Great looking version & beautifully customized by Samsung. Even in 10th edition, Samsung was fast to roll out update.- Mammoth display, my kids can actually use it properly for school online classes, as screen is sufficient when viewed from near distance.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 mAh battery is NEED of the times, with so much dependence on online activities. I use it full day + almost half of the time on HOT spot. Still, battery works for a 1.5 to 2 days. Charging is very fast, but not ultra fast. 30 min can increase around 50% battery.- Both the SIM support 4G (that‚Äôs plus), as we can practically use 2 JIO SIM for almost double the data, without any switchover.- Separate SD Card (up to 512 GB), actually is a great feature. Existing memory of 128 GB is sufficient as of now & SD cards (high capacity) are not cheap as such. So, Samsung did a right thing to provide enough memory from beginning.- Mobile speakers is good for normal music (less bass) & conference call. You actually feel part of the room, when conference call over speaker.- Camera is really good. So many features re there & I am yet to fully know them, as my basic usage is not for photography, but my children makes great video from this phone.- Figure-print sensor response is good, but when finger is moist due to sweat / water, it doesn‚Äôt response. That‚Äôs problem with all the phone, but the moment you wipe your finger, you are good to go. Response time is ultra fast.- Thanks Amazon for delivering within 3 days, even in partial lock down conditions.Not So Good: (for M31)- Not thin & light. Additionally, I have put up a sturdy cover + glass, so weight increased heavily. After few days you get used to it.- Doesn‚Äôt come with Samsung Security feature (like other galaxy series premium phone). However, Samsung does offer S-Secure app to lock certain apps with finger scan.- To many Samsung related apps (like global goal etc) & many of them are still to be known what it does. But Samsung can reduce such apps to save memory. You can disable few of them.- SMS can‚Äôt be deleted with a swipe (like in case of redmi),that‚Äôs important as many of the OTP/temporary messages should be deleted to reduce clutter.- Mobile torch can‚Äôt be switched of with a phone power button. This is a required feature, instead of going to notification & switch off torch.-- No light sensor in front, as it helps to avoid call going in hold during conversation. I read on Samsung forum, that front camera is used, so we have to hold phone in particular normal angle, that will ensure that call doesn‚Äôt get disturbed. Now, little used to it.- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. Apps run like butter & it never gives a message of storage space running out, in spite of heavy storage.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.If you are looking for a sub 20k feature rich phone, go for M31/Samsung. As it is far batter than any other Chinese options available, which are good in flashy advertisement, but in long run performance, they can‚Äôt match Samsung.

Exynos 9611 is a very good processor and you can put limit(70%) on it by turning on power saving mode. You don't need to charge for two days because it has massive 6000mah battery. Samsung mobiles always come with it's premium Super AMOLED screen which has very nice color rendering capability.

I will also give feedback for the same on samsung community page.(ohh my nationalist feeling during border tensions and determination to not buy chinese untill they are same)SAMSUNG M30 (5000 MAH) which I bought for my father WAS GUD FOR ALL OF these problems(but is doesnt have gud camera as m31 offers)The Product m31 is gud but I will suggest you to go for m21 insteadm21 has everything that this phone has (in 14000). I am telling U macro cam doesnt makes sense even for photography addictsthere is no use of extra ram with this processor (4gb is enough)Now talking about m31PROS:ImpressiveImpressive LUK and designgud rear camera, crystal clear photosas told by companygud front camera with features like Bixby and AR doodle and all told by comp. and all works really wellgud displaygud UI A bit heavyThank You VeryyYY MuchH....!!\n\n', "\n\n  The first android phone that I bought was from Samsung way back in 2013 and after a horrible experience with it, I stopped buying Samsung phones. Between 2013 and 2020, I must have bought atleast 10 phones. This time I had to buy a Samsung only because I had to buy a non-Chinese brand and other non-Chinese brands' mobiles  were out of stock.  Bingo!, Samsung didn't fail to disappoint me this time too. 6000 mAh battery lasts me a day with almost 15% by 8PM after a full charge in the morning. I must mention that I don't play any games and I am a basic user. Just checking messages, making calls for around an hour and around 2 hours of You Tube or other video platforms.  The last phone I used was priced at 7999 and it had around 50% battery at 8 PM. The inbuilt keyboard is one of the worst I have used.  Read a lot of praises of One UI but its not good compared to others. Many apps like First Cry, Amazon take too much time to open from the Recents tab. So many extras installed. Screen I can't say as I mostly get to watch videos at max 720p, camera is a major upgrade over my last used phone so I liked it. Fingerprint reader and face recognition are good. Call quality is Good. Speaker volume is Ok for ringing for incoming calls but not OK for watching movie unless you have vulcsn hearing or there is pin drop silence around you. I have to put my hand over the speaker grills sometimes while watching movie.  PS: No, I can't use ear phones. There's a baby at home. Have to put an ear to him too.\n\n", '\n\n  I purchased this samsung galaxy M31 phone from STPL through Amazon on 26.07.2020. After using it for 15days I realised:1. its so called fast charging adaptor takes 3 hours to charge the phone.2. I recently purchased a Samsung EVO SD Card 64GB from amazon itself when i installed the SD Card in the phone it is not reading SD Card while the same SD Card working fine in my other phones.I have been cheated by STPL on the platform of Amazon by providing me a dummy phone. Either provide me original phone or return my money, please.\n\n', '\n\n  Disappointed with charging time. it takes around 5 hours to full charge, not a fast charging.\n\n', '\n\n  \xa0Amazing mobile. Hats off to 6000 mah battery. Light weigt. 6 GB RAM is doing a great job. Loved the 64 MP camera. Macro shots came out good. Tried the auto focus on the mosaic tiles of my terrace and autofocus was quick and good. Main camera also captured the true colour of the sky. Highly recommended for a low budget mobile with great features.\n\n', "\n\n  Dont get fooled by 8GB ram, it's the processor that matters. a 4GB phone with the right processor will do just fine.

Camera is okay, battery is great although it takes lot of your time for charging, so full charge can happen only in the morning after you put it to charge the night before you sleep.  Do get a cover when you buy one as it is quite slippery to handle. Blue looks great, Plastic body though feels cheap. I got a 8GB ram M31 using it for about a month now, I feel 4/6 GB ram would have served the purpose just fine. Get 8GB only if you are into serious mobile gaming otherwise it doesn't make sense.\n\n", '\n\n  This is honest review after 10 days of use. The phone looks promising with the features detailed in website. I am using 6 gb + 128 gb space black varientPros:1)super display- super amoled brings viewing experience to next level.2)mega battery- enough for full day heavy usage. People who are interested more in social media browsing, its a major advantage. You need not to worry for battery backup as this phone has a power bank inside.3) amazing camera- camera quality is just awsome. 64 mp camera adds life to images.4) samsung assurance - this product has samsung brand value and id supploes with high quality finish and long lasting durability5) no heating issue- even if you use phone for hours you would not feel any heating at the back.Cons:1) slow charging - even though samsung claims to have equipped the device with fast charging then also actually phone take close to 1.5 hours for full charge from 30 % to 100%. This might be due to large battery size proportionaly making charging time to increase.2) missing led notification- though its not a major thing to note but could add value if provided.3) As claimed , processor is not blazing fast, though this phone is great for day to day useage but gamers may feel little disappointment while playing high resolution games.Overall its a great budget phone for modrate users and media lovers.\n\n', '\n\n  I am reviewing SAMSUNG GALAXY M31, after using for 45 days. This is a great non Chinese smartphone. Specially the sAmoled display is mindblowing. Not only the 64 megapixel rear camera but also the 32 megapixel front camera is great.

Performance is also good.Display 5/5Rear camera 5/5Front camera 5/5Battery 5/5Performance 4.5/5Design & weight distribution 5/5It is a real mega monster. I love it.

What I felt attractive is its 6K mah battery. And honestly, its doing its job well.!! My wife font of playing Gaana, streaming Netflix, Amazon prime, hotstar etc almost whole day... still battery stand upto 1.5days.!!!For those who are looking for a better battery backup phone this is it.About the camera, I won't say best, I expected much from the quad camera setup, but its average/decent like any other phone in the range(except some camera feature).\n\n", '\n\n  1)Totally disappointed with this product.Two weeks before I bought samsung m31, Facing issue from the day 1. Frequently its shows a popup with "No sim card inserted" but when I restart the phone it works good for sometime.2)Mobile is filled with Ads, Worst user experience3)Front camera- poor qualityPlease dont buy this product.Need refund\n\n', "\n\n  I am happy with my purchase of Samsung Galaxy M31. After 2 weeks of using this phone here's my review:I found this phone is excellent for all round usage. I am purchased Galaxy M31 6 Gb/64 GB space black.Camera 9/10: Cam quality is very good I would say. When I try to capture low lighting images comes out good but could be have been better. I liked cam features like slo mo and super slo mo using this for first time. 64Mp and 32 Mp back and front camera gives the phone a complete touch the quality of pics is excellent!Looks 10/10: I loved the looks of the phone. Though the back of phone is not pleasing enough but I am okay with it since I am using a coverBattery 10/10: it's mega battery indeed. 6000 mah capacity is enough for normal browsing and YouTube vids view for 1 and half day. For gaming 1 day may be.Display 10/10: i am using amoled screen after long time. View is brilliant compared to others.Speed and performance 10/10: I am not a gaming freak so for my usage this phone perfectly fits in. I didn't find any lag until now.Software 10/10: one UI core is very good indeed. Android 10 comes out of the box.Overall I am fully satisfied with this purchase.Thanks Amazon for this deal I got this phone for 13450 with exchange offer!\n\n", "\n\n  This phone keep hangingIt's been two months I've started using it and it has given a lot of trouble.Everytime I open multiple apps, it restarts.Not done SamsungNot expected\n\n", '\n\n  Best phone in cool price.

Fingerprint reader is accurate and fast to open phone and secure as well.Far better then Chinese phone.\n\n', '\n\n  I had previously used Note 5, S8, and Note 9 before switching to M31.

The phone was heated up like anything (charging 46%) . Later once i kept full charging(100%) and starting using it is normal.

Internet would just go out suddenly for few seconds, camera quality good but video auto focus has some issue. Speed wise also so so...don't know what 6gb ram does as not as fast as expected and hangs if too many apps opened..overall except camera I couldn't find it much better than my old moto x4\n\n", '\n\n  As visible from the other reviews, it is a good phone, I just wanted to concentrate on some "not so good" points for users for whom these might be of particular relevance:- if you turn on the router-wifi (hotspot) forget about using the bluetooth connection, the sound comes and goes- if the wifi signal is weak i get the info "Ready to connect when network quality improves" in the same location where i could still use the wifi, even if very weakly, with my previous phone.- I was expecting more from the battery, it does not last for two full days.Otherwise I am very happy.\n\n', "\n\n  Lovely phone. The amazing battery life and the vivid, bright screen more than make up for some apparent shortcomings. Another interesting feature is a macro camera.. the wide angle camera is very good too. The basic camera has excellent low light capability and gives a bright image (is it the screen or the camera?).. in short the camera(s) perform much better than expected.And the phone feels solid.The battery again is just great. What's the point having lots of features and not being able to use them? The battery makes them available and reliable. I think this is the first smartphone around with acceptable battery life. For a 15K phone (introductory price), this is real good! Great job Samsung. And nice delivery Amazon, I received it the day before the lock down!\n\n", "\n\n  Look and feel : Heavy but HandyCamera: Perfect for its price, both front and back, stability in video is commendableBattery: Just a big battery, that's why it lasts for 1 and half day with standard usage, it's not optimized for maximum performance and backup.Processor: even with octacore processor, Chrome and YouTube have hanged even with Normal usage, so won't say it's a great one, it's fine for standard usageCharging and Charging Cable: Charging speed is decent, Samsung has provided such a short cable, it's not appropriate, Samsung Customer care claims Samsung is providing 150cm cable, while in reality they are providing 75cm long cable only\n\n", "\n\n  On the 11th day of delivery  of phone, sound of main speaker  get down. I don't know why but it's not very low. Even I can't hear the ringtone. Over all phones built quality is awesome as well outstanding camera performance.\n\n", '\n\n  This one is the best when I bought this in the sub-20k price range.Maybe the newly launched M31s is the only that can best it.Spec wise even better than A series which is the next grade of Samsung.Good screen, good camera, good battery life. Multiple unlock options with face and fingerprint. Latest Android version. What more can you ask.\n\n', "\n\n  I had a horrible experience after buying Samsung M31 immediately after it's launch. The screen display got non-functional just in three months of usage. My display got blacked out just in two minutes while I was watching video. Screen went completely black as if it's switched off. The mobile didn't have any physical damage and mishandling. There was not a single game installed and I used the mobile during lockdown just for calling and and watching videos. When I contacted the Samsung service center they called it's liquid damage called bleeding and it comes under physical damage and therefore I will have to bear the repairing charges of display change which is 5000 rs. I am really disappointed with the service and company policy where the consumer is exploited for non-functioning of mobile even though it happened on its own. Buying such an expensive mobile which doesn't work for few months is really not acceptable and company should take a note of that and act accordingly in favour of the consumer. Substandard products are being made and delivered to the customer and charged in the name of policy terms and conditions.\n\n", '\n\n  This phone has worse camera in slow motion. After that 6000 mah battery is fake thing it seems to be 4000 only. And in the last but not the least u cant hear other person voice while u r doing calls.

It is truly crazy!I have been using this phone for a little over a week now, and I am just in love with everything it has to offer.The camera quality is just amazing, people just need to make sure that they set the default output of the pics at 64 Mp as the phone naturally clicks pics at 16 Mp mode to save space.I love that my phone is add free (which is such a relief!) And all the other features are just so fun to use!This phone is seriously a SNATCH at the price Samsung has introduced it. The best of features at such a great deal.Just go for it without a blink if you are looking for a phone under 20000.This is truly a treat to use. You wont regret it.\n\n", '\n\n  Fingerunlock work just fine but little wet then less response battery is descend cam ..hmm i thought it is 64 MP haha ..but pic is just fineIts well over 02 of usage, no hangup smooth touch .multifunfions doing well but when hoping frm good network area to less net area n coming out frm there ...to again full net area ..the phone behave very slow# needs to restart again for good reception of network ..i dont knw why but it happens almost all time ..small game just fine but not for heavy gamers ..Even with soft back cover ..phone back colour is fading out ..very disappointed about its poly ..whatsoever materialOtherwise the phone is doing good in this budget.üôÇ\n\n', '\n\n  Just purchased samsung Galaxy M31 - 8 GB RAM-128 GB Storage 2 days back. different screens on the phone are opening without touching the touch screen once we open one function.

Samsung is most powerful devices this feature should have in this devices too..4. Sounds quality is very poor in wired earphone. I jave compared with many devices with same earphone Samsung is very bad in all others. Dolby atmos is not good in Samsung.  Lenovo K4 note gives more output then Samsung.  Poor bass in Samsung.5. When I start snapchat app it will take more time to load and run camera. Other brands phone works well in this price and specifications.6. Screen quality and brightness is good.7.

Functioning is quite satisfying. Most importantly, a very good smartphone in this range and it is made in India as well.\n\n', '\n\n  64mp camera is not that good. Its image orocessing for 64mp is bad. It is like drawed picture more or less when you zoom more. Its colours are not that real and it doesnt feel that good to take 64mp photo. Its battery is good but at the first charge it took ages for me to get 100 percent. But after that it got quicker i.e it got to its original speed of charge. Software and its ui looks premium and good. There is a little lag while you fast open recent apps ( You can see it rarely, but for some apps u see it for sure). But overall its good. You will see some features which are that useful to you but when you see it will feel good. I think samsung does it because it wants yo make us feel luxury( but luxury in the sense not that useful but it is there) and honestly it feels good to have it. You will feel it good, simple, elegant to have it in your hand.\n\n', '\n\n  I had ordered this phone on the day of launch. I got it very next day .Appreciate the quick delivery by amazon.

And most of all Ads Free.Phone consCannot log into google account on the very first time, you will spend your entire  first day with debugging like wifi internet won't work and list goes on regardless of the latest software update.Samsung factory apps cannot be deleted and have to change the settings to stop automatically install apps without consent and unnecessary notifications.Processor is slow, so things take a while to function sometimes, even if u have the 6GB ram like YouTube videos  double touch sometimes doesn't work to 10sec rewind or fast forward the video, fingerprint unlock is not competitivelly fast but can live with it and other apps where rarely touch will work on lag. Doesn't come with back case and screen protector .... and screen protector  is a must for gorilla glass 3 and back case is also required , finger marks come very easily  without it.Final verdict , when your first few min of use is spent with so much issues that u cannot do a simple google log in , your excitement is shattered into frustration, even though the rest of the time there is no issues.....Samsung please wake up!!!\n\n", "\n\n  Earlier, i bought M30s for my family members and i used the same few months. I haven't satisfied on mobile phone  performance and camera.  During that  time,  came to know, the launch of M31 in the market. Gone through the specification and booked on the release day itself .The over all performance fare better than M30s due to 6 GB RAM.The camera quality is very much better.The battery life is very good.Worth to buy this money\n\n", '\n\n  Good phone I had ever seenReviewed on samsung.comWell, the Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in blue, the first thing I did was put the case that I had already prepared. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to falling asleep playing on my mobile and using it, and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 64GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 64GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.\n\n', "\n\n  Battary Life:I have bought this phone for long battery and good Camera, however this phone disappointed me in both the cases.1.Battary Life: I am using this phone since 11th August 2020 and now it's 15 days.Phones battary got drained in just 04-05 hours of average active screen usage.This performance is worst than 3000 battery.2.Charging : even after 4:30 hrs of charging phone is not fully charged with given adaptor.This is one of the worst phone battery ever seen.I am getting frustrated because of this.II. CAMERA:So called 64mp camera, quality of camera is seems to be like 32mp camera and is not that much good.III.The worst part is, I have recommended this phone & he bought this phone and facing the same problemKindly replace the phone on immediate basis.We don't want to continue  with this kind of phone.\n\n", "\n\n  Hello  everyone  I have purchased samsung M 31 8gb ram 128 gb storage  in Amazon and I have used for 1 week and  I am giving  review m31 excellent  screen touch keypad ,face unlock good working and finger print unlock excellent and as specially battery  6000mah  kept  full charging and I have tested continuasly  on data I got 1 day  and with wifi  and calls 2 days I got battery backup and mainly , one kept in review about heat I want to tell you onething m31 while using data on and listening  songs online  and chatting , video songs  to gether  and then you will get little  bit heat not heavy after seeing review I have checked  and this result I got it ,so frds  m31 RS 18,999 I have exchange my mobile to this I got  PRICE 15,267/- AFTER EXCHANGE MY OLD MOBILE  AND BACK COVER 399/_ STANDARDso frds if u ask me I will suggest this one 8gb ram and 128gb storage with in budget around 15k change, don't  think too much buy and enjoy for 4 to 5 years\n\n", '\n\n  I\'m writing this review after using the phone for a month, and here\'s the detailed review of my experience using the phone.‚Ä¢ BEST PARTS1) SCREEN: Straight up the most attractive part of the phone. The sAMOLED display is crisp, color accurate and legible even in the hardest of lights. And the Always-On Display is a bliss, with customisable clock faces and even options to place own photos. Since the display is AMOLED, this doesn\'t cause much battery drain (about 1-2% more drain when keeping it "Always On" as compared to off). And the bezels are not noticeable much, and the screen is super smooth. The refresh rate is still 60Hz, but then it\'s not geared towards gaming. 9/102) BATTERY LIFE: Absolutely unbelievable! The 6000 mAh battery is no joke and it delivers. I use my phone heavily (~10hr screen on time, with video calls, gaming and instagram scrolling) and still the battery lasts me a day and a half. Charging is also good, it takes almost 2.5 hours to get it from ~20% to 100%. 10/103) PERFORMANCE: The 6/64 variant caters to my needs perfectly. There is always more than 2 GB of RAM free, even when there\'s 4-5 background apps open. Sometimes I minimise my game to respond to a notification, and then forget about it; and when I open it after 6 hours it\'s still there in the memory. Phenomenal!The processor, now. Before buying the phone, I read a lot of reviews as I was skeptical about the processor. Snapdragon 730G is better, they said. But to be honest, I really don\'t see the difference. This phone has never once lagged in my one month of using it. It is snappy and DOESN\'T HEAT UP.  10/104) SOFTWARE: As soon as I started up the phone, I opened up the app drawer and removed all the apps that could be removed, and then disabled some I didn\'t need and couldn\'t be uninstalled (Samsung\'s mostly), so that\'s GREAT. Also, I ensured I disabled notifications whenever any spammy notifications arrived, and within two days my phone was ABSOLUTELY bloat-free.Samsung\'s OneUI is beautiful. I have no other words for it. The dark mode goes well with the sAMOLED display, and is absolutely great to work with. I\'d always been a fan of stock Android and Pixel, but OneUI changed me. 10/105) CAMERA QUALITY: I\'m not an enthusiastic photographer, but as far as day-to-day photography is concerned, it is magnificent and highly detailed. You need to tweak settings in the Camera app to suit your taste and also set the resolution (64MP photos are 3:4 aspect ratio, but I prefer Full screen, for example). I also got GCam installed and that\'s added benefit, if you care. The wide angle lens is nice! There\'s barrell distortion at the edges but you get an option to automatically correct it in the settings. Macro camera is able to pick up details easily and really close to the subject.Front camera is equally good, able to capture details nicely. There\'s also a wide angle mode for the front camera, though it\'s just software and there isn\'t an actual wide angle camera at the front. 9/10 for both!‚Ä¢ NOT-SO-GOOD PARTS1) The speaker quality is not breathtaking. It does the job and is reasonably loud, but I prefer headphones or else my Echo Dot for audio, so it doesn\'t matter.2) The back surface is "glasstic" and smudges easily. Get yourself a cover and you\'re good to go.3) Fingerprint sensor is FAST but use it once with sweaty fingers and it can\'t detect anymore unless you clean it.So, there you have it. If you want a no-nonsense phone with great battery, screen and camera, with NO ads (read: Xiaomi, Realme) and NO bloatware and a BEAUTIFUL UI, look no further. The Galaxy M31 is THE phone to go for.P.S. call quality and network is also flawless. I use airtel.\n\n', "\n\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)Pros1. Great phone with 128 GB storage and 6 GB RAM at this price.  Definitely great  value for money.2. Total 5 cameras make it a great photography experience. (wide angle + depth + macro for close ups.3. 6000 mAh Battery lasts for more than 24 hr with moderate use. Charging is fast. Takes 2 hr to charge from  20 % to 100%.4. Switch over to USB type C cable which is going to be the future universal cable across all devices of all companies.Cons1. 128 GB memory is great but within a month it has started getting reduced with software updates. It is the same game that the mobile companies have been playing with the customers. One has to discard the phone while it is still working well because of depleting memory. Let me see how long I am able to use this phone despite my settings  to store most of the things in the SD card.2. Highest sound volume is also very unsatisfactory. In fact, the worst sound volume among all phones that I have used earlier including three different models of Samsung Galaxy.3. The positioning of cameras on margin is problematic because we are used to camera lenses positioned around the mid-line of devices. It is difficult to aim the camera with a side-aligned Macro lens.4. Default Font type and size is very small. Option of Samsung Font is provided and it has better readability.  But even after switching to Samsung font and increasing the font size through display settings it works on some websites but not on many others where the font remains small.5. The phone heats up while charging . I never experienced this heating while charging with any of my earlier Samsung phones..6. The charger has a USB Type C cable. Therefore, you have to make sure that you carry your new cable with you all the time on the go till it becomes the normal charging cable like the present Type B cables found in each home and office.7. Very difficult to take screenshots with M31 because the volume control and the on-off switch are on the same side adjacent to each other.8. Samsung has saved some money by not including  ear phones in the phone package.  Earphone  doesn't cost much but a new earphone with a new phone gives good feeling to customers. This was not expected from the cell phone giant like Samsung.\n\n", "\n\n  Seller must be banned... I ordered this handset twice.... First time it was ON inside the package.... I returned the parcel that time..... Then ordered again.... Today after opening the handset everything was looking good, but when open Sim slot it was very tight from inside.... When it ejected finally, the Sim slot was tampered... I think it's returned and repackaged handset sold by the seller.... So the seller must be kicked out from Amazon Prime...\n\n", '\n\n  Its battery life is really amazing. I charged this phone from 0 to 100 in 160 mins. If you are heavy social media user you can use continously 10hrs with one full charge.Pros:Good wide angle cameraBest selfieGreat features like app timer and you can see how much you spended time in each day.It can be suitable fir even 13 years child too with parental control.Good display qualityFast responding with no hangsAll rounder.It owned its samsung exynos 9116 soc processer. Which prevent from loss of performance when heatingCons:Dust on phone will easily visibleDesign is lightly oldSamsung still remains the launcher no improvement in launcher.Charging time is little slow when compared to redmi latest phones\n\n', "\n\n  Overall Good. 6GB RAM provides smooth operating of Phone along with Android 10 and One UI 2.0. Though fast charging feature is provided in this model, feels like its charging at normal speed and samsung needs to check with this. As I also own a Samsung galaxy M40 whose charging is really fast as compared to M31.Only drawback is that can't get proper sized tempered glass for this mobile. Hope Samsung will try to provide Proper accessories for any new Model they launch.\n\n", "\n\n  Great phone in all aspects at a pocket friendly price point. i was using several expensive brands earlier and i needed another phone for some generic use at home. i was looking for a good balance of quality, brand, performance and a decent price point. this samsung galaxy M31 fits that bill perfectly. i have been using this for several months now and i am extremely happy with it's performance. speed and responsiveness are great. camera quality is comparable to several expensive phones that i have at home. finger print sensor is a great relief and makes it highly usable. display quality, like all samsung devices is really superior. light weight on the pocket both in terms of it's real weight and also from the price perspective :-) Strongly recommend to budget conscious folks..\n\n", "\n\n  Phone built quality is good. It's a very rigid phone. I have already dropped it thrice but thank God phone is working normal till now.Camera quality is AWESOME. It is best in this price range. But camera is not so quick. Phone gives lag while using camera.Battery life is normal if we see a 6000 MAh battery. My usage is mostly internet and I use Bluetooth connection also. I get around 8 to 10 hours of battery life when Bluetooth and location is on.Finger print sensor is working fine. But I think it could be a faster one.Phone is not so quick while using multiple windows. It gives lag.Overall I am fully satisfied with the phone performance. Highly recommended if you are searching a new phone in this price range. GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHT.\n\n", '\n\n  Best Mobile from Samsung I Purchased 2 handset from Amazon, In Just Rs:17499/ You get A Samsung Mobile with 128 GB of Internal Storage, 6GB RAM & 6.4 Inch Super Amoled Screen.Best part of it Mega Moster 6000 Mah Battery first from any Mobile Co.You can buy this Mobile without second thaught. I m enjoying 3 day of Battery life on moderate use.Thank Brand Samsung n Amazon quickly delivered to me within 12 hours.\n\n', "\n\n  I've got the 6GB+128GB variant and thanks to early access and Prime Delivery experience....Pro:1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.7. Price.Cons:1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protectionüôÇ.\n\n", "\n\n  with plenty of very good and expert reviews available for Samsung M31 for its deserving features and quality, I would like to share my experience as a user with vision impairment using screen-reader and Text-to-speech:1. Samsung mM31 features Samsung's own built-in screen reader 'voice assistant', hence Android Accessibility Suite doesn't come built-in. One needs to download it from playstore if the need be.2. Samsung's 'Voice Assistant' is an efficient screen-reader in itself, but those used to Talkback will find it less suitable in terms of gestures and other features.3. The camera is surprisingly accessible with the screen-reader telling you if face(s) get focused. I could click not-so-bad pictures as a totally blind person!4. Samsung's UI and in-built applications offer smooth and faster navigation while using screen-reader. Most of the buttons in Samsung's apps are labeled and hence accessible.5. Attending calls is most convenient with the volume-up button doing the job. Live caption is also another fantastic feature that will be useful for the hearing impaired people.6. There could have been an option to wake the Google Assistant using power button since 'Okay Google' comment is not all that convenient in travel and noisy places.Overall, Samsung M31 is a very good choice in this budget for the visually impaired / blind users too.\n\n", '\n\n  Pretty heavy phone to handle.great response time from one window to another, excellent refresh rate on the screen.Didn‚Äôt like was too much heating on the phone. May becoz of the 6000 mah battery at the back but it‚Äôs ok as most of phone do heat up.Battery life is something on how the person uses it, it‚Äôs recommended that use the phone till it indicates it needs to be charged say 15% or even 5%. And then charge the phone back again. To have healthy battery life.\n\n', '\n\n  On the next day of release i.e 6.3.2020 ,  I purchased Samsung M31 , as I was very impressed with M20.Samsung the " master in creating mobiles " in the intrest of public and to their taste.  My order was honoured and sent the phone within 3days.Now Iam enjoying the great phone suitable to my purse.No heating in playing and recording videos.Thrillig sound output ..What more I need..I recommend to my friends to own a beautiful phone..\n\n', '\n\n  Review after 4 months of regular usage. The product is really awesome.Pros:Awesome display. Best in its class. Color quality really awesome with good brightness.Awesome battery. Easily lasts for 2 days.Awesome camera. The images captured are having enhanced colors that are very attractive. Better result in low light compared to my other 22k phone. Memory management, even high resolution images are of ambient size. Front camera result is really awesome.Processor. Its good and I did not find any lag since I bought the phone.Weight management and balanced body.Conc.Notch display and back mounted fingerprint scanner. Other phones come with punch hole display and in-screen or side mounted scanner. But the price is higher and also in many display is ips lcd and not super amoled. So its the preference by which you should decide.\n\n', "\n\n  First of all I received the phone I was incredibly happyIt says it has 6000amper but I found it was not up to the expectationsIt takes around 3:30 hr to charge completely while it should only take approx 2:30 hr,even battery drains out quickly within 8-9hours on WiFi the battery turns from 100% to 17%-this is how 6000mah works????? ofcourse not!!!!It heats up a lot while charging like about to burstFor me it was a terrible experience ,I will not recommend anyone to purchase Samsung m31 , Samsung is a brilliant industry which makes brilliant and durable products but its only applicable to their high rated phones(above 60000rs)In the case of m31 they have too many compromises which reduces the battery efficiency,camera quality and all and you not need to waste even 17499rs for that you can get these lower performance even in the budgetüòâ of 6000rs,for me it's a high rated product with low I mean very low performanceBetter to by any other brand products in place of using this phone by Samsung!!!!!!!Anyways Samsung is the brilliant company but here they are making compromises in low priced productsSo same your time and money both,üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅWhat's inside the box-adaptor with able,phone,warranty papers,pin and that's itüòµüòÇAnd now I don't want the product coz for me even 17499rs matters alot\n\n", "\n\n  1. I'm writing this review after 120 days of usage, using the 6GB Ram /128GB version.2. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon - within 72hr delivery.(b) The phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(c) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(d) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo, realms and Mi. Works like a flash.(e) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(f) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. Front camera is average.(g) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(h) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking approx 3hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.(c) Finger touch has less sensitivity.5. Otherwise I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. üëç\n\n", "\n\n  It's a nice phone with good battery life, Camera is amazing-especially when coming from MI note 7 Pro or even GALAXY M30 S. Since I have switched from MI to Samsung, UI is not as convenient or familiar than my previous phone.I do not see a lot of properties when trying to restrict no of users for my hot-spot, either I can completly hide it or change password every time I do not want anyone to connect to my hot-spot (previously connected to my phone hotspot).Rest the phone is nice, it's is not 6.5 I personally like bigger phones but that is repayed by the amazing camera quality.No heating issues as of now. It takes quite some time to charge but battery backup is nice and usually goes through the day with heavy usage (WiFi, Gaming, Netflix and all).Go for it if you want to switch to Samsung its is even better than SAMSUNG A51. So please compare.\n\n", "\n\n  The camera of this phone is a total joke, it doesn't feel like 64 mp at all, front camera is even worse, and the wide angle camera is the funniest of all, it looks like image has been stretched unnaturally, the rear camera will capture good picture only when there is complete light, little bit of darkness and the camera quality becomes 2 mp. i was using oppo f5 which was launched in 2017 and the camera is way way better than the m31. This phone has a good battery life, display quality is good, fingerprint is not that fast but decent, this phone is not for gamers. You should buy this only if you like watching videos, listen to songs and use normal apps. Strictly Not for photography and gaming.\n\n", "\n\n  Phone is good. Little heavier for Samsung S series user.  Overall worth the money. But dissapointed with the charger they send with the phone. It started peeling second day itself. The black plastic coating is coming out exposing the wire inside. Didn't expect this.Update:After using it for almost 1 month , I found that internet world slow in this model. It's lags a lot.\n\n", '\n\n  One of the best smart phones in the market right now, when it comes to the camera I have observed it takes awesome shots with front and back camera, and in low lighting it awesome.With day to day usage If you play heavy games like asphalt 9, pub g mobile exsynos 9611 gives awesome performances  with game booster I perfectly  maintain ram and processor for optimal performance and heating issue too minimal.Coming to battery life powered by 6000 mAH it gives best performance as of normal usage like social media, surfing taking shot, watching movie and listening to songs battery can last up to 1 and half day easily. When you do heavy gaming like pub g and all in full charge u can play 5,6 hours continuously.Coming to online streaming and entertainment  app like netflix and prime video it supports widevine L1 support as know as HD streaming or you can watch movies, series in high definition.Now the coming to design it samsung glastic  design which feel premium in hands and u water drop notch display with quad camera setup is just awesome.Now the trade mark and the best part of samsung smart phone display 6.4 inches, 1080x2340 Full HD super AMOLED display with 83.92% screen to body ratio. It really best part of smart with color full display  and out door brightness  is all awesome.\n\n', "\n\n  I got it on Saturday morning. You will get a mobile and charge. Which is OK. No phone cover, no earphone, no screen glass.Everything is fine now coming on the battery part.6000mh honestly??? I charged it 100 percent in the night and today in the evening It was 56 and I didn't used it a lot. But I think it is okay in this price range ... I don't play games but if you are a games lovers. You need to think it twice. battery part is a questionable thing.Face lock doesn't work properly. Sometimes it recognizes your face and sometimes it doesn't\n\n", "\n\n  The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good phone with lots of features for the pro. You can actually set your phone the way you want it to be. I have heard a lot  of negative comments about the camera but I found it a delight. A little concerned about the battery though it boats of 6000mAH but really doesn't last beyond a day and a half considering the least number of apps that I installed over the existing (not much) bloatware. The phone is really good in terms  of speed. I purchased the 8GB RAM + 128B internal memory version which is the best (at the time of my purchase). The screen resolution is good and display is much clear. Great features like dual volte and wifi calling. Altogether a good phone and also non-chinese. My mobile charger stopped working in the 2nd month.\n\n", '\n\n  Fantastic phone in this price range. Overall its a very good smartphone. The sAMOLED screen is very sharp and clear. Fingerprint sensor is very fast. Even face unlock works great even in low light. 6000 mah batery stands true to its word. I play pubg without any lag in hd quality and high frame rate. I am a medium user of phone and watches many videos . Still the battery lasts more than 1.5 days. The phone gives a very premium feel. The camera quality is just awesome. One cannot expect any better quality in this price range. I am delighted to be the user of this phone and recommend it to everyone. This phone is just mind blowing.\n\n', '\n\n  Good phone for the price. Screen quality and performance are good.Cons: Speaker not so great. Low lighting camera not so great.1 star less for delivery.Fingerprint and face unlock is good. Camera in outdoors gives great pics.\n\n', "\n\n  1. Camera Quality is good but come up with a problem it will give error in Bust shot about low light even though room light is sufficient.2. Phone heat up too easily in 15 mins video call.3. Battery life is not good...Drain out so early I don't use phone much but still. I would say Samsung didn't keep the promise of best performance in 6000mah battery.If all these issues can be addressed through Software upgrades then it will be a better phone.\n\n", '\n\n  The look of the phone is amazing! Its sleek and looks prettier than a lot of more expensive phones.. however the face unlock is not sensitive, it doesn‚Äôt unlock if youre wearing glasses at all! The battery seems good enough but i haven‚Äôt used it for very long so can‚Äôt really say. What I‚Äôm most disappointed with is that it doesnt come with headphones!!\n\n', '\n\n  Camera is awesome, you just need to know how to use it in the best way.Fingerprint, face unlock are pretty fast.Battery lasts for 1.5 days for person like me who listens to music, plays games but less often, talks over skype and click photos every now and then.I love this phone and I appreciate myself for choosing it over realme 6 and other such Chinese phones.Good job Samsung üíØü§ü\n\n', '\n\n  Very best product at this range. Battery and camera is awesome. Network connectivity is not as strong as M30 but it could be better with some updates. Design and build is awesome and also glass is strong I dropped 3 4 times but its totally fine. I would recommend to provide some updates for network stability rest everything is awesome.\n\n', "\n\n  Previously, I was using Samsung A6+ which accidentally got broken so needed one phone too as I can't get it to repair as it was during the lockdown. So, I was looking to buy this phone looking at its features, and after hearing that it will even be available in 8gb RAM and also its price. But, when I checked this phone on Amazon and Samsung website firstly it was not on stock. So, then I waited for a few days to get it. Later on, as soon as it was on stock I purchased it, and also it was my first experience to purchase a smartphone online. I received it on time and it's just a perfect phone as per my usage. I would also prefer it to everyone who wants a smartphone with good storage capacity, battery, camera, and performance then it is definitely the one.Thank you Amazon for timely and undamaged delivery and also for making it available during lockdown too.\n\n", '\n\n  What I like about the phone is that the touch is smooth, the back camera is good but i honestly expected better considering that is its usp. The 2nd day of using the phone my instagram stopped working and was force closing every single time and the whole phone would freeze and not work for 30secs. The battery life is surprisingly not good. It takes a long time to charge since its 6000 mah battery but drains completely in a day. The face unlock is not that fast. The camera is noisy at night and the wide angle sides gets distorted. Even the front camera is not that good at low light. Also absolutely hate that Samsung has so many pre installed app which cluster the phone and is of absolute no use.Overall an okay phone, for me i expected better at 17k.\n\n', "\n\n  First of all after 1 month of using m31, i am now going to post a review about it.. so let's start with the followingScreen-first of all if you are a movie lover or watch movies mostly on mobile then its samoled has no comparison and is best in all cotegories.Battery- optimization of battery is not so good, but yeah you can play pubg continuous for almost 7-8 hrs which is quite impressive.. now you can think of urself how good is its batteryProcessor-its processor is quite good, but but but optimization of it is worst, 9611 is quite gud, if it may be optimized well..with the software and games..You can get fps around 35-55 in pubg smooth +extremeBody-body is made of plastic, and no frame but yaa with a cover it look amazingüñ§Weight- with a massive 6000mah battery weight of the phone is well managed not so heavy, not so light, normal normal but yaa more than normal devicesLast but not the leastAdvice-download Package disabler pro and disable all bloatware.. it will make your device more smooth...I guess in the next update they will optimize the processor and fix there services bugs..Stay safe‚ù§\n\n", '\n\n  Nice phone with almost all advanced features.Pros:-1. Display is FHD and full marks to it.2. Sound quality is ok.3. Android 10 is handy.4. Full marks ro 64MP quad camera.Cons:-1. Battery is never felt like 6000mah. Rather it performs like 4500mah.2.while receiving the call the panel sensitivity is poor.Overall value for money. Must buy.\n\n', "\n\n  Pointwise Review after 15 day usage:Buid quality: Basic build quality with plastic uni-body, not that impressive but not that bad. Looks just fine. Back panel attracts lots of finger impressions.Screen: must be the best displays that samsung is providing in M series within this price range or comparable to even flagships.Rear camera: it has 4 rear camera sensors, here is what i felt about these:-Main 64MP sensor: probably the best in this price range, performs phenomenonal in day light conditions. However, in low light conditions you start to feel that it's a lower mid rnge phone, though all phone in this price segment struggle in low light conditions.Macro sensor: it fine, not bad. However, i had more expections with it.Wide angle sensor: pathetic qualityDepth sensor: must be the worst, very poor edge detection.Front camera: inclined towards good camera category, it can be improved.Processor: no problem in normal usage, but not recommended for those who want to play heavy games on it.Ram management: initially more than 3gb memory was always in use without software or even sim. But after tweeking the optimization settings and removing bloatware, it performing better. No complaintMemory: it's fast, no complaintBattery: it's really a monster. With normal usage of calling, camera, messaging you can easily get 2 days of battery life. It can be easily extended to even 4 days if you use very less.Charging: Though samsung claims fast charging, it's not. 15W charger doesnt seems to be really providing 15W power. Theoretically, it should charge 6000mAh battery in 2 hours, but it takes 3-3.5 hours for full charging. Not that impressive.Speaker output: it's fine, not that laud but not that low.Sound quality in earphones: Good quality output, no complaintFingerprint and face unlock: no complaintCons:1. Slow charging speed2. Very poor wide angle camera3. Poor edge detection in depth camera sensor4. One serious problem that others also faced: randomly 2 times it got rebooted itself and stuck on boot screen for 20 minutes. I have to see if it persists.Edit: after july OTA update battery performance reduced significantly.Edit: after 1.5month of usage; working fine. Rebooting problem didnt happen again after OTA update. Battery performance was better before the update. However, still it's not bad. One need to tweek app settings to optimise the juice suckling of the apps.\n\n", '\n\n  Awesome device.

It feels like it's  a picture and your eyes never tired of it like it used to be in LCD screen. The fast charger provided is fast enough and charges at 1% per min. The huge 6000Mah battery is really Monster and last for 2 days for a normal user.

SAmoled gives you feel of touch.4.Battery life is as expected. With continuous music listing and net surfing it will last a day.normal uses 2 days around. It's really monster.5. Camera is really awesome and in night mode it's clarity you can see. Super se upper. Wide angel feature is cool and you can cover larger areaYou may get upset when:-1. During phone update you may fill mobile is getting heated.2. S/R ratio is low which is good for your health but if network strength is low you may get call drop.3.

Speaker sound is almost negligible. It is so hard to hear audio clips, meetings etc.It may be a problem with my piece or the model - I don't know.2. Selfie camera is not that great.\n\n", '\n\n  It is very disappointing that phone has heating issue. On simple use you will feel the heat and once you have played any game then it is like old iron. It is heat the upper part of phone i.e. camera side.On the other hand screen stuck while using whatapps. Screen touch start working abnormal. I have brought  2 handsets i feel similar  issues in both of the handsets.I am not a tech bug but second phone user has raised concern  to amazon they have ask to install diagnostic  software  after that i have no idea what they have done to his handset.\n\n', "\n\n  This phone has mainly 3 main objective:Monster battery, camera and display.I will give review in details about this phone.Battery: with approximately 2hrs of gaming time and 7hrs of screen time battery life took almost 30-33hrs to come from 100% to 5-15%. As well as it took almost 4-4.5 hrs to fully charge from 5% to 100%.Camera Quality: I have attached few picture samples from ultra wide angle to macro to 64MP shot to 32MP selfie shot. The camera Quality is excellent but if Samsung could add the single take feature by some software update, this phone could be unbeatable at this price segment.Fingerprint reader: it's very responsive and took micro second to respond. It's face unlock feature is also great responsive.Processor: exynos processor is good but can't handle heavy game, expecting Snapdragon chipset later in this range as well as I really want ardeno GPU than this Mali, but due to having 6gb ram and 128gb storage phone didn't lag at all but I personally need the change in GPU at least.Speaker volume is average. Best advantage is having 3.5mm headphone jack port.Having 3 in 1 slot i.e. 2 nano SIM and 1 dedicated micro SD card slot.Back panel is very fingerprint catcher, but using a case can solve this issue.And that's all from my review, feel free to rate my review high and can ask me any queries related to this smartphone.\n\n", "\n\n  The fone is awesome overall. I just hv one problem. The screen I view before clicking a picture and the one that is captured are missin 4 inches.. is this a fault?

Only thing is is bad and disturbing in it is its charging speed ie so slow afterall having with 15 watt of its original charger it use to take like 3.5-4 hours to get fully charge seriously disgusting but hopefully its other features backlash that ........

With 6gb ram, this mobile dose all job smoothly.6000mah battery is really good offer. Earlier 'Battery backup' was a big issue for me due to continuous travel for my sales job.  Now, I can happily use GPS maps with worring about battery drain issue during work hrs.This is worth a buy. I charge daily night, but my observation (not tested) says, battery definitely last 1&half day with normal use.\n\n", '\n\n  Last 4 years, i was using  Samsung galaxy on next, when I seen Samsung galaxy m31 launched on Amazon, I seen all feature m31, I really socked  64 miga pixel camera, 6000 MH battery, 6GB Ram, 64 memory, it unbelievable price only ( 14,999/-), I really liked this phone camera quality & battery backup, also phone running very fast, phone color and design very cool, thanks Amazon. üôÇüòÉ\n\n', "\n\n  This phone is OK but not as good that you guys are thinking about its specifications, camera is not even average but OK for those who don't know what is a photo look like now a days, according to build quality and size phone is good in handling but you need a good quality cover and a screen protector otherwise quality is worst, I can't even compare this phone to any mid range phone that is the only quality this phone have üòí, and secondly people thinking about its android version that's really funny most of the phones in the market coming with same kind of android version so better wait and let another phone to come out, I am not saying don't buy it but for me wait if you don't need a phone right now.\n\n", "\n\n  Ok ok product...I don't know how people are giving so much rating for this product...My review post 2 weeks of usage:Pros:Budget friendlyNice camera with nice features.especially wide angle and slow motion.Nice amoled display.Battery is also ok.Cons:front camera adding so many filters which I dont like...missing the natural picture die to these filters.camera specs dient match the quality of pictures.Battery is taking around 3 hours from 0 to 100 which is too much time.at the same time draining in 1 and half days of modern usage.Face lock is not smooth sometimes responding bit slow.Very low sound comparative my any previous models whether its samsung series or redmi series.Mobile also doesn't works seamlessly.taking 1 or 2 secs to open the app some times.Finally so so product.and could be I expected too much from the config they mentioned abt.\n\n", '\n\n  In this phone everything specifications are described in the detail section.  But the actual thing is we should  buy or not. Then I am telling you my experience with this phone.In daily usases this phone is absolutely fine in this price segment. Only one thing is that you can play PUBG on recommended settings  not on the high settings for long time. Otherwise there is no any issue in this phone. Only one thing I want to say that this phone is the best.Love it. Display is absolutely fine.Go for it.\n\n', '\n\n  I am using Samsung phone first time in my life. I was generally using Mi phones in past. But this time. But this time I want to experience Samsung phone & I found Amazing Phone Samsung Galaxy M31 phone as compared to all Mi brand phones. I am excited with following reasons to use this phone:- 6000 mah battery, for 2 days not need to charge even using for games and zoom meeting- 4 rear camara. I got amazing results even in Night also. Front camera results was also amazing.- 6GB RAM. So phone is not hang even so many applications are running on background.- 128 GB ROM. Not need to use memory card.- Space black colour. Amazing sexy looking- Function of taking selfy using our hand palm.- Font is also good.- Brightness is great even in sun light.- Bluelight filter can help to reduce stress of eyes to use phone in nightI strongly recommend to buy this phone.\n\n', '\n\n  After using one month ..These are good things I noticed..1. touch is good 2. Battery is good.. 3.screen is perfect .  Now comes to bad points..1.some time screen got blackout automatically not expected this.. 2. in simple application it get hang some time(i am not pubg player dont know what they are racing).  3. Camera is okk okk i hv vivo with same specifications ..As it is camera phone still it lags with vivo...\n\n', '\n\n  Speed of mobile is Good, no hanging, smooth gaming. For me Camera not up to the mark...as I earlier used Samsung note5 and 8mp of note5 is much better then this 64mp. Samoled is great. Finishing of the product is so not good....alignment of fitting lacks perfection. Camera holes alignment or side edge you can see poor craftsmanship.\n\n', "\n\n  I felt myself very bad for switching  back to Samsung. It is having all good quality as they mention in specifications. But I can't imagine  why it is generating that much of heat at upper half part of mobile. Very scary even to touch. Hope it will be solved in future with some system upgradation. Waiting for the same- Charan\n\n", "\n\n  OCEAN BLUE, 6+128The product was delivered to me on 8th March 2020,so i am reviewing it after 3 months.1. Camera QualityThe quad camera is awesome, even some shots can be compared from cinematic shots you can zoom the pic upto extreme extend.Front camera is 32MP and selfies are as good as the pics taken from rear camera Sometimes even better.Overall camera is excellent .2. DISPLAYWith the phone equipped with superamoled along with infinity display you can watch some videos on YouTube even on 240p and it gives the feel of 360p quality.Needless to say about HD video their views are crystal clear.Although the display is protected by Coring Gorilla 3 but i would suggest the buyers to apply screengaurd the quality of videos or the touchscreen functions would not be affected i can assure you for that.3. BATTERY LIFEThe most demanding feature in any cellphone.For normal usage like movies, calls, videos calls, music the battery would lasts upto almost 2days.On the otherhand if you are a heavy gamer like PUBG or CALL OF DUTY, then also you can play these games 8-10hours continuously.I have played PUBG on M31 8 hours continuously with 15% battery remaining afterwards.4. GAMEPLAYPUBG never lagsWhenever i am playing with my squad they say the game is lagging as some squad or any enemy is approaching but i never ever experienced any type of lagging during gameplay except the network error problem or sometimes when internet is not  working properly.Otherwise, if you are a pro player of PUBG you can reach CONQUERER rank with this phone.5. RAM & ROMThe buyer will get almost 110gb of user space as their some pre-installed and system apps.With 6gb RAM you are all set for smooth and fast gameplay and multifunction.6. FINGERPRINT READERYou can add more than one fingerprint.Beside that the sensor is at the back side so at times you can feel that the sensor should have been on screen otherwise the sensor responds quickly to the fingerprint.Overall it's best phone in the market below 20000.The only missing quality was 8gb ram according to my opinion but on 29th May 2020 8gb RAM variant was also been launched.The one and only drawback with this cellphone is its charging time as the battery capacity is 6000mAh but the charger is of 15W only so it takes 3hours to charge the battery 100%.\n\n", '\n\n  Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it\'s M series of smartphones.Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.Rating: 5 of 5.Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.Rating: 5 of 5Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it\'s awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that\'s normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it\'s ok at this price point.Rating: 5 of 5Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.Sound: 4 of 5Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can\'t be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.Rating: 4 of 5.Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word "Excellent". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.Rating: 5 of 5Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.Rating: 5/5Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.\n\n', '\n\n  *Looks_Premium*Samsung has gone with glasstic for the back of the phone ‚Äî plastic that looks and feels like glass ‚Äî which is smart, because it gives the phone a premium finish while keeping the weight low. And weight could have been a problem given that Samsung shoved a monster 6,000 mAh battery into this thing.And don\'t let the "glass" in ‚Äúglasstic‚Äù fool you, it‚Äôs still plastic and still prone to scratches, and it‚Äôs glossy, making the phone slippery to hold, especially for someone as butterfingered as I am. On the bright side, the phone doesn‚Äôt look cheap, unlike its predecessor.Battery Life- An Absolute BeastPacking a whopping 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M31 has managed to reach roughly the end of two days on a single charge, despite being connected to Wi-Fi for the majority of that time, with Bluetooth on and multiple wearables and a pair of wireless earbuds connected for good measure. That‚Äôs on top of the heavy use activities I mentioned previously. Simply put, you‚Äôd have to be a serious procrastinator to even think about draining the battery completely in a single day.Samsung Galaxy M31 ‚Äì 4The Galaxy M31 proves that having a multi-day battery life doesn‚Äôt cost the Earth, and if you were planning on using the M31 as your main media device of choice, this unbelievable battery life paired with the phone‚Äôs AMOLED screen makes for a match-made in heaven. You could binge content for hours on this thing.The only letdown is the supposed inclusion of 15w fast charging, which I beg to differ. When hooked up to a power outlet, it took just over two hours to reach full charge from 8%. If charging your phone overnight is part of your routine then you‚Äôll never have an issue here, but needing a quick top up before you leave your home is just out of the question.Camera Quality- Good but not BestGood quad rear camera setup - 64MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensorShots taken with the primary camera during daylight are quite satisfactory, images are detailed, especially the 64MP shots, and they showcase good dynamic rangeThe ultra-wide sensor, like on any budget phone, is a good addition - it takes social media-worthy images in great lighting conditions (in low-light, the quality dips and pictures look grainy and noisy, wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges)Photos taken in low-light looks good - switching to Night mode helps reduce grain in the output and further improves image qualityLive Focus shots are quite impeccable and the camera app does give you the option to set the level of blur before taking a shot - edge detection is very good and the Galaxy M31 does a good job of separating the subject from the backgroundThe macro camera takes decent shots outdoors (though, the quality dips when indoors and the output is restricted to 5MP in resolution)The 32MP selfie camera is quite good and takes detailed selfies (though, in low light, the quality goes down a notch and results are grainy)Overall, the cameras on the M31 are good for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title crowned to the POCO X2)Overall Verdict:Samsung\'s Galaxy M31 delivers the promise of long-lasting battery life and one of the best in its class in the market. In the camera department too has improved a lot over the predecessor.\n\n', "\n\n  Got this after my long stint with the Lenovo Zuk Z2 plus. Jumping from a Snapdragon (820) to an Exynos was difficult, but had no other choice. After a lot of searches and collating data and feedbacks, went for the Galaxy M31 (6+128). Was planning for an 8gb model but was not sure how good Exynos 9611 would handle tasks, so went with one level down. To be honest this phone does the job very good and more than what is expected. Back is a finer print magnet and the open camera is prone to damage unless a good back cover is put on. App loading time is a bit high. Fingerprint and face unlock is fast though the face unlock takes a longer time sometimes. I tested face unlock in dark environment and worked good as the brightness fills up your face from the device to capture the face. Similarly works for night time low light selfies. Games run smooth with minor frame drops at high settings otherwise you wouldn't find any (I am not a gamer though tried quite a few for sometime off in the lockdown). Has a specific game booster mode. There's no lag on the phone unless you install multiple apps as in my case. I have a usage of lot of apps at all times on my phone (32 as of now including the preinstalled ones). You'd only find lags while opening the app drawer beacause the phone is unable to handle so many apps installed. If you are not into keeping many apps on your device this is the perfect phone for you. Camera quality is good. Has a night mode which captures good pictures in low light. But selfies in low light are not good. This phone did not disappoint me (only if I have lesser apps). Preinstalled apps are removable. Battery backup is very good and with a fast charger is power packed. Faster fast charger would have been more helpful for this battery though. Liked it but would be happier only Samsung could have shortened or removed the notch with a punch hole as in the M31s. Samsung does not provide SD processor and Amoled screen together and they have been running the same old 9611 processor of theirs on all recent (previous ) and new phones as well from the A & M series. It's time Samsung thinks about it. Just not to increase the price of a phone with few new features and same old processor won't do good. Overall a good phone to go for. A tough competitor with other Chinese counterparts. You can also checkout the M21 which only has a difference of camera (48mp) if you want to save some bucks. Other features mostly remain the same.\n\n", "\n\n  Its finger print reader is really quick.. i dont need any faster finger print reader than this one.. battery life is really awesome.. and camera is one of the finest among smartphones..I am submiting the review after a month's usage... I bought this mobile just for 12.5k.. exchanging the old one.. The only thing i felt was.. we have to use a good back cover for this device.. and so the phone becomes heavier when compared to most of the other mobiles.. but the features it provides are awesome..  The always on screen and camera features are the two things.. which I liked the most in this device..\n\n", "\n\n  I this product 4 days ago and camera stopped working.

Go for it without any doubt.This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag.  I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 8GB ram and software gives smooth experience.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is goodNot So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- poor low light camera performance.- processor could be better.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n\n", "\n\n  I am writing review on comparing it with Redmi note 5 pro as I have used previously this one  and to be honest I don't find this M31comparable to it.Still some reality check is necessary,  so that I am writing this review after using M31 for 45 days of use.I bought it as an alternative to Chinese brands but feels lag on several departments.1.In fingerprint reader, you will not be able to notice it when ur mobile get opened by touching  fingerprint sensor,  in note 5 pro vibration with fingerprint sensor touch was there to make it easier.2. Even with 4000mAh battery note 5 pro was working whole day well and no battery drain problem was at all.Now with 6000mAh battery I get also whole day battery backup and little more than note 5 pro. In M31 I fell battery drain problem of almost 10%,when I woke up in the morning.3. Camara quality is more better in M31 than note 5 pro, but you have to also mind that note 5 pro was launched 2year before . And even at that time it was providing excellent camera quality.4. Touch screen with S-amoled in M31 is excellent.5. Non availability of front flash while in note 5 pro it was.6. In spite of fast charging option, the 15W charger provided with pack of it is not enough to charge it fast, you have to buy another high capacity charger.7. Loudspeaker has less volume compare to note 5 pro.8. Blue light emit more comparable to note 5 pro. I always use it in filter mode.9. Price wise it is good, got  M31 with 6+128 in 17 k compare to 4+64 in 15k of Redmi note 5 pro.\n\n", '\n\n  Samsung Galaxy M31, A brilliant product by Samsung! This phone just grabs attention...The Camera quality is superb as I have seen till now, the 64 Megapixel camera just excels. The quad camera does it job in a very useful manner, 64 MP main camera  has a f1.8 aperture, 5 mp depth camera has a f 2.2 aperture,  5 mp macro camera has f 2.4 aperture and the last one 8 mp 123¬∞ Ultrawide camera has f 2.2 aperture.  Each camera excells in it\'s own way, the 5mp camera  focuses on the depth ina very keen manner , 5mp macro camera focuses on every object that is too close in a matter of 3-5 cm distance,  8mp 123¬∞ Ultrawide camera brilliantly captures all those scenarios which you wish to have it in your phone.Video quality is so Good that it feels like you are a photo-video maker.  The super steady video feature helps in video making, and it will be usefull if you are a vlogger.Talking about the screen, the 6.4" inch sAMOLED FHD(Full HD) + infinity U display will give you a attention grabbing feel.Battery performance is so good that you can use it a whole day! I get a total 21 hours of backup time Including Internet, Music, Video all combined together.Talking about the processor it just excels in this performance, the 6GB ram 2.3 GHz quadcore processor will help improve gaming experience along with AI game booster.Charging capacity has been Increased with 15W Fast charging  within no time you can charge your phone!Overall I liked this phone very much and I recommend you to go ahead without giving a second chance.\n\n', "\n\n  The Samsung Galaxy M series has gained a lot of popularity thanks to affordable prices and up-to-date hardware. Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment. Samsung has now launched a successor to the Galaxy M30s, called the Galaxy M31. You now get a quad-camera setup, an upgrade from the triple camera setup on the M30s. However, the processor and the battery capacity remain unchanged. Will this be enough to keep the Galaxy M series competitive in the market? We review the Galaxy M31 to find out.At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin, but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.Pick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.When you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.The Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.\n\n", "\n\n  This is truly an amazing phone. Have been using it for over a month now. The price is quite affordable and the performance has been really good. The fingerprint scanner was comfortable to use while holding the phone.The 6000mAh battery definitely gives a long lasting performance and it's really impressive. With the 15W charger provides a quick charging time, with the battery life lasting for nearly a day.The camera quality is quite good although not the very best but at this price range, it's definitely worth it. I particularly found the quick detection and focussing of the 64MP rear camera quite helpful while capturing the pictures in daylight.The wide angle lens do give you good pictures though they could be slightly distorted at the edges. The 5MP macro camera is also quite decent and captures really good images in the daylight.Potrait shots were good and the camera app gives you the option to blur the picture to your desired level. I found the 32MP selfie camera to be very good. Overall pretty much satisfied with the camera performance.Software performance and UI are top notch. Although the design of the phone is good, the heavy battery adds to weight. This can be a slightly good thing as the phone might not slip easily out of hand.I bought the Ocean Blue version of the phone and it looks very nice to see as well as use. Would definitely recommend this phone if your budget is below 20k.\n\n", '\n\n  1. Display-Awesome.2. Fingerprint-Awesome.3. Face reader-Poor.4. Battery - As the Samsung gives a 6000 mah battery but it going low in only one day from morning to evening.5. Net network - very good.\n\n', '\n\n  Battery life and RAM performance is very good, but the USP - 64MP main camera and other 3 cameras do not perform to the specifications. No portrait mode so no 3D photos on FB. Even the 64MP main camera fails to capture details and objects blur on zooming in - not at all expected. Macro camera does some good work, but not able to capture details required for a macro photo. Wide angle camera and live focus are just good enough. Night mode is not so impressive. Overall, average camera gives average rating for the otherwise good phone.\n\n', "\n\n  : It takes an extraordinary effort to grab some eyeballs for a Samsung smartphone, if it does not belong to the 'S' or 'Note' family - a feat achieved by Galaxy M30 and M30s last year. The M series was launched as an online-exclusive to compete against Chinese makers like Vivo, Realme and Xiaomi. The most recent smartphone launched under it is the Galaxy M31 which succeeds last year's Galaxy M30s. The latter was one of the best mid-range smartphones of 2019, offering a massive 6000 mAh battery, a feature you also get on the M31.While the new smartphone borrows most of the features from its sibling, it does get some upgrades too, including an extra camera at the back. Samsung hasn't increased the price much with the base model of the Galaxy M31 priced at Rs 14,999 and this itself should attract a few buyers.: It takes an extraordinary effort to grab some eyeballs for a Samsung smartphone, if it does not belong to the 'S' or 'Note' family - a feat achieved by Galaxy M30 and M30s last year.

Super Amoled Display: its having suoer amoled display which is way better than anyone in this budget.. as samsung super amoled consider as best due to high ppi.. which makes every dot if colors very good..Suitable for netflix, prime, video watchers .2. Battery: it has 6000 mah battery which is highest in this budget segment with 15W fast charging, took almost 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%But belive me if its charge 100% use continuously till evening, and still u have 20-30% left..PS: normal use, not games..3. Quad camera: it has quad camera 64-8-5-5 which is also not available in this budget segment in any others..Same configuration..Plys sasmung has better image processing softwares and good sensors..Hence the camera quality is also good... I had attach pics too..64 mp main camera, 8mp wide angle, 5 mp macro camera, 5mp depth camera.. 32 mp front camera..With 64MP Ultra-High Resolution ISOCELL also Bright GW1 image sensor.Slow mo with super slowmo which is way better, live focus, night mode is excellent... 4K recording from front as well as primary cameraAll these are good...4. Exyons 9611: it has Exyons 9611 which is better than many processor, it runs PUBG as well as many heavy games at HDR quality without any frame rate down, not even lags..So good one.. yes its not better than snapdragon but yes it works better till now i found nothing negative from processor..5. Audio: it has one good quality of speakers and very loud..It comes with Dolby atmos hence using external source of speakers from this phone is way better....Best phone in under 20K segment, i brought this in 17K 6-128Gb configuration..If u want this for just only Gaming than dont prefer this, if u want daily use mobile with less gaming, and high usage of videos, social sites surfing etc than its best one...What i was thinking to get more1. Gorila glass 5 for screen instead of 32. Face lock little bit faster (although no use of face lock bcoz maximum prefer finger lock)3. Liquid cooling technology if possible (bcoz if u play pubg for more than hours in full settings it will heat little bit but not as Xiomi phones did)4. Want some more colors.. only royal blue & black with plastic body.. still it looks betteeI m using black one..5. Atleast add Case in mobile box, only charger provided...I hope i added the valid points....PS:- it is made in India, and has no links with China bcoz samsung has world largest factory in Noida where these phones were made, not assembled.. most of the parts were manufactured in India, only super amoled screen shipped from South Korea and few other parts from various countries..As all company\'s did.. but has no link with china.. for more google it\n\n', '\n\n  I was previously using moto g5s plus and this was selected after comparing many models in this price range. Using this for the past 4 days. Everything is fine, the clarity, sound, network, net speed, gaming. Heard many negative reviews for the processor used. But comparatively no drawbacks. You can definitely go for this model. And to mention, the SAR value is also very very less in the price range.Camera clarity is good and very good voice clarity of calls.Battery life is only one day for full Internet usage and 3 hours of calls.\n\n', "\n\n  Fingerprint reader works quite well but not so amazing as my old redmi note4 because it only works if your finger is completely moisture and dust free. Camera quality is amazing, works well even in low light. Even though I expected a little bit more battery life (I am using always on screen and maximum cpu usage) it is pretty good. Screen quality is good and I have to say that even for an above average hand sized person like me, it is difficult to use this handset in a single hand (you cannot access the notification bar while using a single hand). The lenght of the phone is a bit over sized i guess. Talking about other physical attributes, it is a bit over weighted because of the 6000mAh monster of a battery it is packing. There are a lot more advanced features encorporated in this handset and most of them are very much user friendly.  I have been using this phone for 2 months now and honestly speaking I have encountered hanging 2 times. But both of the times it was the application that wasn't resposding. First time I had tried to close the application and it took some time to respond to it. I know its a bit harsh to criticize such a phone that provides so much for a budget price but I thought it would be better to give an honest experience here because for buyers like me every penny is hard earned!Thanks.\n\n", '\n\n  This mobile phone is amazing in photography and its battery also good and fingerprint sensor works better than you expect but some time your hand wet and dirty it not perfectly works...I am using from the launch of this mobile I want to suggest you plzz make splash proof phone in mid range.I remember 10th June my phone was wet in slowly rain in only 1 or 2 minutes and this accident reactions on 24th July in morning 5 or 6 AM my display is covering black liquid like cloud. I am going to pay 7-8 thousand for display repairing.... I am unsatisfied to display plzz make splash proof phone in midrange smartphones.Thank You\n\n', "\n\n  I have been loyal Samsung user for years now. This one works smooth but trying to get used to its screen length. Camera works fine. I haven't noticed any difference between normal cam mode and 64mp mode, but both are fine. Macro lens version is to be simply admired. Slow motion works well too. Overall it's a good phone. I am satisfied.\n\n", "\n\n  As Again Samsung Totally Proven Me Wrong. I had used Samsung J Series Smartphone for approx 3-4 months because of it lacking problem I switched to other brand now back I am using this smartphone m31 its almost a month old and atleast once a day it's got hang. The camera is so poor full on artificial colours can be seen from front and rear as well.  The Smartphone is totally a waste of money in this range.\n\n", '\n\n  Writing this review after using it for 3 months now. Overall a great buy in this price range, i purchased 64GB model for rs 15999. Amazingly fast touch, display is really good with true colors, slim & light phone, good shape easy to have a good grip, battery pife is amazing lasts almost for 2 days even if i decently use it, really fast charging, camera is not very good if you conpare it to other phones like redmi or oppo of this range,night vision camera is almost of no use, still camera is ok ok, fingureprint sensor not very fast and good but works fine, good speaker sound, fast operating .\n\n', "\n\n  Quality and a class product with many new and advance features. As I got this product on 15th Aug, I experienced the accuracy of Battery life  with 6000 mah. But I can adjudge the quality of battery and it's durability after use of some more days. Till now I am fully satisfied with the product. I can advise whosoever is reading my review may decide this phone m31 without any confusion as this is latest with quality display, voice with advance features.\n\n", '\n\n  Nothing much to say about disliking,Because I love this phone,Camera quality is best,Battery life was my preferred thing to look for and so now I dont have to worry about it after buying this phone.Finger print reader is working best, as previously I used some other phones whose finger print reader did suck after using for a month, but Samsung so far has done a wonderful quality built.I am happy and I know it.\n\n', "\n\n  6 MONTH REVIEW:I came to this phone after using the S7 for 3 years and finally decided to move on to a bigger screen and also the battery on the S7 had seriously degraded to a point where I had to recharge it twice a day.So one of my major draw for this phone was the 6000 mAh battery sadly that was the most disappointing part of the phone. The phone was advertised as having a 2 day battery but with my primary usage of watching videos it hardly lasts an entire day.It does last 2 days on light usage though which comes handy when traveling. I have disabled fast charging to allow my battery to last longer but even in cable charging mode the phone charges quite fast which is good.It also used to hang and restart abruptly quite often initially but after multiple updates it seems to have stabilized.The fingerprint reader requires multiple tries to work as it seems to attract smudges which inhibit it's performance.The Camera was one of the prime reasons to buy the phone and it's perhaps the best feature of this device. I usually use the 64mp feature for highest quality which it delivers.Overall for the price the phone is alright but hopefully Samsung can improve the battery life through some future updates.\n\n", '\n\n  Only within 3 to 4 days I came know that mobile is over heating during normal video conferencing. I urges Amazon to take it back and give refund but they refused. They scheduled an appointment for mobile check. no one came to check the mobile as scheduled before.  The rescheduling was done 3 times but all times no one came. I am so frustrated not only by poor quality of samsung phone but also the poor service by AMAZON. I urge everyone to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PARTICULAR SAMSUNG MOBILE MODEL and STAY AWAY FROM AMAZON AS WELL DUE TO THEIR EXTREME POOR SERVICE.\n\n', "\n\n  The phone doesn't work nothing like it has a 6GB RAM. It lags sometimes at the simplest of places.It works. Most of the time.Finger print reader doesn't respond sometimes.Not recommended for heavy users.Tech specs aren't everything.The curved screen is a headache if you want to use it with a single hand because the palm touches something else on the screen.Can buy for retired parents but not working people.\n\n", '\n\n  Amazing phone with great experience and value for money. These are my experience based review of the phone.1. Camera: 4.5/5 - With awesome camera it stands above all its competitors and samsungs advance software makes capturing moments super easy.2. Battery life- 4.5/ 5: Completely satisfying battery life with 6k mAh capacity. Moderate use can easily support 24 hrs with still 10-20% bateery remaining.3. Fingerprint sensor- 2.1/5: This is the only area this phone is lagging behind. With relatively slow responses time and sometimes even not detecting fingerprint.4. Display- 3.8/5: with amazing display this phone gives an amazing viewing experience. However, brightness control settings can be improved.5. Processing/ Performance- 3.9/5: Moderate use is completely satifying with no lags but when it comes to high performance like gaming & multi tasking, it can support you even to the edge. Battery life drops significantly to half but it never lags. Apps may open slow but performance is not impacted much.6. Charging - 3.5/5: Although fast charging is there but it takes almost 2-2.5 hrs to get 100% charge. This could be improved in subsequent versions.\n\n', "\n\n  The phone is good so far and I have played games like PUBG and Asphalt 9 for around 1 hr approximately. The phone heats up a bit. Not sure about the heavy gamers as I haven't tried playing for longer duration. Apart from it, no issues with the phone. Happy with the purchase. The front camera and the rear camera are just good and there is no lag in the processing of the photo. There are really good apps preinstalled and customization options in UI. I felt the volume of the speaker is a bit low, however it is just okay. I recommend if you want a nice music playing device, go for a nice speaker to use. It's a good durable phone. Not sure about the heavy gamers as I haven't triend pl\n\n", '\n\n  Quality product, excellent speed, battery life of 48 hrs with long usage for gaming videos etc. Best packed product at this price with 8GB Ram/128 GB memory. Samsung Brand Indian manufacturing make it unbeatable.Most honest priced product at this specification by Samsung in M series. Done lot of comparison with A70s/ A71 but find this better in all aspect.\n\n', '\n\n  Very good handset in the budget of 17k that to from a brand like Samsung. i was using Galaxy A7 before to this mobile and other than thickness and few features like on-screen notifications and PIP features are missing.

OS : Latest Android...Looks good...3. Battery backup is best.4. Charging adapter is really fast.5. Display is nice...6. Space is a lot... memory card is not necessary... of course a backup space is fine to keep.7. No hybrid slot...so...two sim and memory card is easy to install.8. Battery saving mode is available that can give a longer battery life...good while travelling...Cons:1. Speraker : Sound quality is not good. Even call sound seems littled distorted.2. Default Message App - I needed to change this.3. Sensor that control screen light during call needed some upgradation...it does not work always...4. Missing default app that displays CPU and resource usage5. Missing metal back...Overall experience is good for this phone...\n\n', "\n\n  This Samsung M31 phone I am using from last two weeks.

It has all the suffosticated requirements for a normal user.5) Software updates - The company has promised  2 to 3 years of software update. That's a good.Unworthy points of its cost:1) Plastic built - Really? For 16K? Come on samsung.2) GG3 - Atleast we can say it has protection. But in reality I don't think so.3) 15w charging - The company claims this is fast charging.  Really? Then what do you say about 30w, 55w,65w and 120w charging... is it slow charging?4) 9611 - Well well... look who is here... the same old guy from past century...

And its outstanding camera quality will impress you to the brim.Last but not least, Brand Value, Samsung always has a reasonable resale value.Cons:Speaker output is low. If you are a type of person who doesn't like earphones, and loves to hear songs on speaker, this product might not impress you.Exynos 9611, though is a decent processor equivalent to Snapdragon 712, but is unsuitable for hardcore gamers.

Smarphone came with all the accessories written on the box.There was no charge in the unit‚Äîodd I remembered samsung delivering fifty percent charge in there products, either way I did boot it up after leaving it for charge for around three hours ‚Äî fast, responsive display, beautiful camera. And you can set settings of the display to natural colour.Software: As far as the Samsung's own UI is concern, I think it's intuitive, lacks some crazy fastness of AOSP or android one projects ‚Äî but with the phone one is paying for the software as well. And might as well, use these OEMs rather than running something plain. It's stable so far and running great. Fingerprint is pretty fast, as fast as my other device poco F1Battery line is absolutely wonderful, it takes almost 3 hours I think to be fully charged, with standard usage it gives me screentime of around 36 hours sometimes 24, while playing PUBG or Call of duty.Camera quality: Well, I only have one word, impressive. Camera on this phone is social butterfly's or some serious smartphone photography, videography ‚Äî although no video stabilisation in 4k mode.Some things to look out for: Phone body catches smudges easily, so get a cover if you are serious about it.\n\n", "\n\n  Camera is average( its good but not good as 64mp)Earpiece is small so you have to aim it to ear otherwise you will not hear other person's voice properlyOnly these two thing i didn't like otherwise phone is very goodBattery is fantastic (with normal usage it runs 3-4 days without charging but usage varies from person to person)Performance is great( i have 6gb ram 128gb internal varient)Bulid quality is also good as per price rangeSmooth and fastDisplay is bestComes with latest softwareFast fingerprintSound quality also goodAnd overall i liked this phone just only the two things i mentioned above that i dont like, thats why one star less\n\n", '\n\n  Pro :ui Is goodBattery life is goodSamsung has good display.Calling  bluetooth , sound, wifi , everything good.Camera is okay not that bad. Not that great cant find that 64 mp feelCons :Phone is sometimes slow even for basic games u can find that crispyness literallySwitching between tabs is slowFingerprint at back is at wrong placement .. not that friendlyFace reader litwrally sucks. Cant identify faces all the time. Doesnt work in the dark. Obviously this is not apple.Check for my pics taken from this phone.\n\n', "\n\n  Best buy for an average consumer for media consumption, watching youtube, and streaming services online...The screen alone makes it worth of buying as it's way way better than the panels on its competition.The camera quality is great and even better than the competition.Battery life deserves a mention wherein for a heavy user, you won't be left searching for charges... it easily lasts one full work day without needing to be charged.Fingerprint scanner could be better positioned but its fast which is great.Gaming would be slightly compromised when compared to its competitors, but I dont think an average user would notice it, because the screen has wonderful color accuracy and contrastOverall the best purchase in this price range.\n\n", '\n\n  Camer day shoot hansum but night only 64 MP flash not giveing that much flash not working only 64MP.also bad video qulity on night shooting onlyBatery useing wifi 1.30hr 10% then 12 hr will finesh good batery back up.Charging also slow 3.30 hr for full charging.Gaming perfomance good.Voice qulaty good.Sound qulity good.Display supper.Hansum styleValu for moneyOnly one think, change prosesor fram E9116 to G730 or higher for gameing .

(I am not a gamer)2. Camera- good at day light shots(front & back). Definitely need improvement at low light conditions. Same camera performes better than this at Realme& Redmi.3.Display- Super Amoled- best4. It does not feel too heavy even though with 6000 mAh battery.5. Android 10- Samsung's One UI2. Latest with great GUI.6. Finger print sensor- fast with great response.Cons:1.Exynos 9611 processor - average. Not meant for gamers.2. Plastic back.3. Charging- ~2.5 hrs to fuel the battery full4.Focus hunting- While recording video camera struggles to focus. You feel it only when viewed on big screens.\n\n", "\n\n  The camera a above decent, it gets nice picture when given proper light. Took videos as well bt for slow motion videos u need natural light, the camera app won't trigger slow motion under low light. Having said that, the pictures are too good given the price range.Coming to battery! U can easily stretch 2 days wid average use, even with battery below 20 percent u can easily game for 1-2 hrs (personal exp). Its a beast when it comes to battery, the only con is the amount of time it takes to charge.The fingerprint reader acts fast bt due to flat nature with the back of tge phone it gets difficult to locate, if ur using a case then no problems. But wid no case u have to locate fingerprint reader, a slight curve wud have been great!Rest I have been using the phone for more than 1 month and d phone fell for more that 7 times bt till now the front screen is intact. There are scratches on the back bt build quality in terms of front glass is awesome.I would suggest any1 to buy!\n\n", "\n\n  One of the best options in the segment.I preferred this phone for its sAMOLED display  and I am very happy  with it's look and performance.

Packaging and charger design could have been better. Anyhow satisfied with choice.\n\n", "\n\n  I bought 6+128gb version on offer. I always wanted a phone which had a very good battery and this phone didn't disappoint me. It's 64mp camera is best in its class. I am satisfied with the phone. It doesn't have constant ads like xiomi or any other brands and it's User interface is very smooth. Fingerprint sensor is fast and exynos didn't disappoint me either. It's pretty fast. If you want to buy a made in India smartphone which in it's production have given some jobs to our countrymen then go for it else choose some Chinese brand who is just assembled in India and doesn't add to our GDP. One big factor why i bought it is because of availabilty of its geniune spare parts.\n\n", "\n\n  This is my first Samsung phone. My family and friends everybody is using Samsung from longtime, so i thought i should try Samsung now.

I read the comments and reviews before purchasing and got mixed reviews about the phone. But when i started using it and noticed about the comments and reviews as given by the others, it was nothing like that. Camera is Superb and Macro feature is awesome. Battery performance is good, display is magical, slightly heating when playing games like COD Mobile, Pubg and Fortnite but it's common.Overall, the phone is really a MegaMoster. The price is good, features are awesome, body is good, sleek design.As per my opinion, buy this and get amazed with best quality and services by Samsung.

Touch screen is very sensitive and I loved it while typing.4. Automatic light mode, which is very  good option and it as acting as per need based on our adjustments on timely basis.5. Optins wise also it has many features that we can enable  for the smart usage.6. Quality of sound is awesome.... feel like we are in theater. Have DolbyAtmos option to change the sound effect. It depends on how you feel it.Cons:1. Vedio of the quality not that much  expected. Not sure there might  be some configurations. Not checked as of now.2.

I was shocked to see that, it could not even sustain little height falling. Screen got cracks and its display went dead. Samsung design is questionable in durability. If government is compromising on quality of Make in India products, then God save this country. I know nothing will happen. I have to shed from my pocket. My MI phone fell from even more heights, but nothing happened. Still working and writing this review from MI A2 phone, which I kept as a spare one.\n\n', "\n\n  Everything is perfect but price is too much & doesn't have TPU case... For 18k atleast they should provide TPU case. Too much high rate & taking advantage og brand value which will cost them in near future.\n\n", "\n\n  When I was looking to upgrade from my old phone I was essentially looking for something that went along the lines of long term usage, good battery life, big storage, a decent ram speed and most of all a decent camera quality; I was looking for all of that in a mid range phone, I am a loyal Samsung customer but in the last couple of years the product was a bit disappointing so I kept myself away from it as much as I could..But when I read through the reviews and test videos for this phone I had no doubt about what my next purchase would be and I bought it after weeks and comparing and checking out other stuff and I am so happy that I decided on this to be my phone.. Let's start with the following.Battery : with 6000mh battery my days off worrying about low battery life is now all in the past, with minimal usage I easily get about 2 days of work done on my phone but if I am gaming then it's easily a day and a half to dot and that makes me a happy woman, the only thing that comes with a battery that big is it makes the phone a bit heavy but that's okay.Camera: the picture quality is quite good for a phone at this range and even with moderate lighting the phone does a wonderful job helping you with those aspects, since I do a lot of video calling with it helps good with those aspects.Graphics, storage and speed: it's fast, it's big with 128gb internal storage and 6gb ram space this phone gives me enough storage and functionality speed I need to do my day to day work on the phone without worrying about any lags on things, which for a mid range phone is very impressive.Yes it has a headphone jack but the package doesn't come with a pair of ear phones that most previous phones came with but if you already have a existing ear phones that work then you don't need to worry.Fast charge that charges you phone to full capacity within 2 and a half hours is lifesaver, I still don't know if wireless charging is a possibility but I am happy with what I have right nowOver all, I am really happy with the product I've purchased\n\n", "\n\n  I bought SAMSUNG M31 (6GB/128GB) Space Black varient.I must say It's a best budget smartphone and moreover its and Indian smartphone which is made in india as well as manufactured in india so this phone can become the priority for those who wants to buy only an Indian smartphone.Talking about the camera,The 64MP rear camera capture the perfect picture as you want to capture and the detail are so accurate , macro lens is also great to access and one can enjoy it if they love to capture nature scenery with  closeup. The video stabilization is very well and performance is excellent moreover there is a inbuilt AR ( Augmented reality) creation system which give you and creative mindset to draw any feature along with recording live. The Screen response is very fast and you can travel from app to app with ease. Screen display is very well protected with 3 layer of gorilla glass and the picture quality is outstanding. Its processor is one of the best processor to play high graphic game like PUBG, Fortnite , Free Fire , Call Of Duty etc. Gamers will love this smartphone. Speaker are very loud and accurate and one of the feature named as 'DOLBY ATMOS' give you out of the space music experience because it make the music in 4D type  I mean the music seem to be roaming behind us from left  to right which give an extraordinary experience for music Lover. Coming toward the feature , I have never seen this type of AI ( Artificial intelligence) features in other smartphones, the pop-up view, AR Drawing pad, Bixby vision, Smart Switch, Dark mode etc. Battery life is very long and it comes with 6000mAh battery along with 15W charger and charging cable is of good quality. The fingerprint reader is accurate and very useful feature because it also help you to fall down the notification pannel which is and effortless feature.I am Loving this Smartphone. And I Guarantee you that you will also Love this phone.I totally recommend this smartphone because it is one of the best budget smartphone with all in pack and one should have this smartphone.\n\n", "\n\n  Theis phone completely suits to all my needs. I have been using realme 3 pro for the last 1 year. The phone was quite good, but the samsung m31 beats it in almost every category. This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.The phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.It has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.The only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.In the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades. But for now I'm 99 percent satisfied with this phone( aside from that palm swipe screenshot). This is a must buy phone.\n\n", "\n\n  I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.Pros:Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.\n\n", "\n\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 is a power packed Complete Smartphone. I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and I did not find myself waiting for an app to load all over again.The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. I enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which let you stream full-HD content.I played PUBG Mobile on the Galaxy M31, and the game defaulted to high settings by default with the graphics set to HD and the frame rate to High. The game was playable at these settings and I did not notice any issues. After playing for 20 minutes noticed a four percent battery drop, and the device did get warm to the touch. The big battery will allow you to play for quite long without needing to plug the smartphone into the charger.With my usage, the battery lasted us for close to two days without any issues. If battery life is important to you, the Galaxy M31 will not disappoint.Samsung Galaxy M31 camerasI found the Galaxy M31 to be quick to detect what it's pointed towards and lock focus in daylight. Photos turned out well and had decent details. Text at a distance was legible on zooming in. The smartphone enables HDR automatically if required. Switching to the wide-angle-camera is easy and you can get a wider field of view. However, while these shots look great as is, zooming in reveals that this sensor misses out on details. Wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges.The Galaxy M31 is capable of separating subjects and backgrounds when shooting close-ups, giving a natural depth effect. The macro camera takes decent shots.In low-light the Galaxy M31 takes longer to lock focus, so you will need to be patient while taking shots\n\n", "\n\n  I am writing this review after using the phone for a week.I had very clear expectations and idea about what I want and till now I am extremely happy that this phone has ticked all the boxes. I am a heavy user with about three hours talk time, another two hours using the phone as my tab, checking mails and working on other apps. Besides this I listen to music and an episode of a web series and checking  faebook. All these put together, the battery lasted for more than one and half day. Moreover, even with a 6000 mAh battery, this phone looks surprisingly small and light.Next comes the display which is Samsung's forte and it is stunning aa ever. The black is black and the colours are brilliant.Camera is quite good. I recorded a dance performance of about 5 minutes which has come out very well with all details. However, low light performance is not the best. Overall, camera performance will get a very good from me.Navigation is easy though I like stock android more.However, this is not the fastest phone. Exinose 9611 is an old processor and even with 8GB ram ( I have two M 31) the speed of multitasking is moderate. But, that is sufficient for me since I am not a heavy gamer. And at this price range, I think it gives more than enough.However, one thing of this phone which is really annoying is the length of the charger chord. I have not come across such a short chord in any phone. It is barely 2 ft and you have to keep the phone very close to the charging point which at many times is not possible and hence becomes a real challengeOverall, I am very satisfied till now. My last phone was Nokia 7 plus and this NEW is definitely scores over that by a good length. In fact, this better than Redmi Note 9 which is driven by SD720.. A great value for money.\n\n", "\n\n  Samsung has made a significant improvements in its low budges smartphones thanks to the healthy competition by all other counterpart smartphone  makers. I have been using the phone for almost 2 months now, it is going absolutely fine. The most eye catching element in that phone is its 6.4 inches SAMOLED infinity U display which enables you to watch high resolution videos and movies a genuine  pleasure. The details, colour generation and the vibrancy of the colours are truely soothing to eyes. Apart from that it comes with Samsung EXYNOS octacore processor accompanied with a 6 GB DDR4 ram which does a decent job, for normal user it works absolutely  fine and if you are into high end games then it might not be the best option. In addition , it has a moster battery capability with 6000mah battery it covers the entire day pretty smoothly eventhough  it has been used quite rigorously,  that inclues browsing internet heavily, watching 1080p videos on youtube, talking throuh video calls so on and so forth. It also supports dual 4g sim simultaneously that means you can use 2 4g sims with LTE option on at the sam time. Cameras  are also does a decent job, which comes with 64 Mega Pixels primary camera along with 3 other cameras for depth and other functionality, its  front camera is of 32 Mega Pixels which performs pretty nicely. There are few drawbacks in that phone and they are its back is made of plastic which could have been replaced by metallic materials and looks of the phone could have been beautified 10 times of it has been given. Another cons I would say its camera inspite of having 64 megapixels in low light its performance drops a little. That's is all about the phone . Overall, it is a good purchase considering the price bracket which is under 18k and it also comes with exchange option.\n\n", '\n\n  nice phone. very user friendly. so heating problems, no hang issues.i bought a 128GB RAM size and performance is pretty good so far. Battery back up is also fair. look and animations are excellent. overall a nice phone to have at this price range. another most important this to note is that the phone is manufactured  in INDIA. YES!!! you heard it right -- "INCREDIBLE INDIA" jai hind!\n\n', "\n\n  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n\n", '\n\n  The phone is good but am facing intermittent issues with internet connectivity especially when using phone hotspot. Amazon although says 10 day return policy but it directs me to some app to check my phone or call Amazon expert whose calls have a wait time of 20 minutes. Later I had to call Samsung customer care to get it resolved but problem persists. DO NOT PURCHASE MOBILE PHONES ONLINE.\n\n', "\n\n  On the day, the mobile was released I couldn't hold my excitement and ordered this Monster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything else from this except battery life. I needed a smartphone with bigger battery that lasts longer than usual so that I can do everything that I want to.Talking about the battery life, it works as promised. On Wifi, I used continuously on Day 1, and it took 21hrs to drain from 100% to 0%. And I tested on mobile data the next day, it took around 15hrs to drain completely. Im super impressed with the battery life that I will blindly get a smartphone from Samsung if it has a big battery.Fingerprint reader and Face recognition are pretty fast. I was never expecting this speed at all. Camera quality is really good. I always had doubts in mind about cameras in Samsung, but this one cleared off everything. I feel proud to have this when I see the pictures on other handsets.Many people have misconceptions and complain about the processor in Samsung mobiles. Actually, it all depends on your usage. Processors in Samsung handsets aren't outdated, they deliver pretty good performance. I never had any such problem.The mobile is not lightweight like other mobiles. But, a 6000mah smartphone of today will definitely have this much weight. I hope the design will change in future to have a lightweight smartphone with bigger battery.Finally, I want to conclude that if you want a phone that targets Productivity, M series is best. And M31 is the King of this segment.\n\n", '\n\n  My review comes after a 15 day use with the M31.The features offered by this phone at this range is really astonishing.Let it be the monstrous 6000mAh battery or the clean One UI or the Processor.I was a bit confused at first with the Processor as I felt Snapdragon offered by other manufacturers had an upper hand over the Exynos, but I am clearly mistaken as the performance of Exynos is on par with a 7 series Snapdragon (Exynos might even be better than Snapdragon).I have not faced any kinds of issues with high end gaming or continous usage.The next big thing about this phone is the Battery, the 6000mAh battery is actually the real deal.Under heavy usage I have got a battery backup of nearly 18hours.Even with the monstrous battery the phone is lightweight and easy to carry.Samsung has offered decent 64mp quad back camera which also houses an 8mp wide camera and a 32 mp front camera.In my personal opinion the M31 camera stands ahead when compared with its competitor Motorola Fusion.The fingerprint sensors are backmounted instead of inscreen unlike the new normal.The backmounted fingerprint sensor seems to be faster than the inscreen fingerprint sensors provided on the Samsung A70 smartphone.But at times I have faced issues with slow detection on my M31.Disregarding this small problem the M31 is the perfect budget phone currently in the market.I as a customer of Samsung highly recommend you to purchase this mobile phone.Worth every penny.\n\n', "\n\n  Giving a review after 5 months of heavy usage so worth reading.Pros-1. Unlike every other Samsung phone which is not apt for gaming , this is the one friend. Many said me that don't go for it if you want to play but it never lagged or heated up while playing high end games.Super smooth usage and interface.2. Camera is drop dead awesome. It literally justifies the 64 mp quad camera.3. I guess no one can give a negative comment on the sleek and classy look of the phone. It feels great to hold and 10 on 10 for looks.4. Screen resolution and quality is also super fine.Cons-1. The quick charge is almost equal to normal and there is nothing to get excited about.2. The battery is unable to justify 6000 mah as it claims. Other brands offering 4000mah lasts equal to this and after good all day usage u need to plug it again in the night. I expected that 6000mah will go 2 days easily but not in this case.Conclusion- After such detailed analysis after 5 months, I can easily say that the pros can easily oustand the cons and this is one of the best budget phone Samsung has offered. And with such a reliable tag of Samsung, go for it without a second thought.You will see that the other brands will offer somewhat same features in little less price but I would suggest you to go for this as this deserves the every extra penny spend, and ofcourse not a Chinese product.\n\n", "\n\n  I am writing this review after 2 days of usage. I was very excited at first about this phone when it came but now I am very disappointed with it. After using for some time, I put it on charge at 10% battery and after 3 hours it was just 54%, even after 9 hours of continuous charging, it could only charge upto 74%. Also, the mobile data doesn't work after some time. We need to switch off the SIM and then ON it for further usage. I am really disappointed with Samsung. Now there is no option of returning the phone and all my money is now wasted. This policy of Amazon just proves to be a big problem for genuine buyers.Okay so after 4 days, now the charging issue is automatically solved, while sometimes the network issue still persists. Overall I am now satisfied with the product.\n\n", '\n\n  Here is The Review of my New M31 Samsung Galaxy Phone with 6 GB Ram and 128 GB Storage. As i m owner of CSC and having BC Point. I need phone with more data storage and fast Processor. So i bought Samsung M31 phone. It has most big advantage of having 6000 MaH Battrey which gives longer time to talk and to manage all things. Secondary thing is about storage, it also had more space for downloading big movies, songs and other documents. I love this phone also bcoz it has a feature of Dual VOLTE, which provides unlimited connectivity which means we can use Both Networks on 4G. For me i m satisfied with overall performance of this phone. So i m refering All to buy a best Samsung Galaxy S31.\n\n', '\n\n  Writing this review after 1 Month of Usage Best Budget Samsung.-The battery life is truly monstrous 10/10. (Checked from morning 100%, gaming, YT, Netflix, music, surfing throughout the day..it was still at 57% after 16hrs of use)-The screen is the best, super amoled no match. 10/10.- Sound and BT quality 10/10.- UI is great, from touch to usability is 10/10.- So many gesture and features.- Fingerprint reader is not as fast as other same range Chinese phones 9/10.- Camera is super cool and with lots of modes (quality resolution definitely can be better than phone under same budget and specifications) 64Mega pixel quality not upto the mark- Memory and performance 9/10.- Looks could be more stylish yet feels premium and good inhand 8.5/10-  overall I rate it solid 9/10Specs and other factors same as mentioned in product details.\n\n', '\n\n  Internet connectivity is very poor in this device. The same sim card in the same location in this device is rarely catching 4g whereas in other device (ipad/ vivo u20) it is always catching 4g. Hence In the sense of internet connectivity the performance of this device is very poor. If you like to have good internet irrespective of network provider you should definitely avoid this device. Now I am in a situation where I do not know what to do with this highly priced useless device.\n\n', '\n\n  Pros- Display is awesome, Satisfied with camera quality and battery life is too good ..No lag issue till now..Cons- Slow Charging speed takes 2.5 hour to charge full.Overall a good phone inhand feeling is also very good ..\n\n', '\n\n  This phone is so perfect in everything. Camera quality, phone touch, screen amoled wallpaper is so nice. battery performance is so good that if you charge it for on time, you can use it for more than 24 hours. Overall this is the best phone to purchase. I would recommend everyone to buy it.\n\n', "\n\n  Before reviewing my samsung M31, I would like to share what I was actually seeking in a phone.1. Best available battery life with fast charging2. Good audio quality in video recording (for uploading acoustic guitar covers on YouTube)3. A nice camera4. Good enough processor for multitasking5. Additional slot for expandable memoryThis M31 from Samsung proves great on all fronts as per my requirement.I am not a pro tech savvy who goes into the minute detail of every feature but would sum up the best I could experience in the last 5 days.Camera Quality - My wife loved it more than her One plus 6T, pretty unbelievable though. Both front and rear (4 lenses) do their job quite well.I video recorded a guitar cover and both picture and sound were upto the mark.Battery life- one full charge lasted around 36 hours on a normal usage. 0-100% charge took around 2.5 hours ~ 150 minutes.Gaming/Processor - Played Real cricket 20 and Gear club Racing, absolutely smooth.Feel of the phone - Slightly bulky due to heavy battery but that's okay.Most features similar to A51 but price almost 8k lower.For someone like me who doesn't like to spend more than 15k on a phone, this might be the best option for you.\n\n", "\n\n  It's my first Samsung Galaxy Smartphone and I am amazed to use it. The Quad camera it has, is one of the finest you can get in this price segment. Even the front camera is also good for a decent performance. Battery is 6000mah which is more than enough for your daily requirements. So you want a long lasting and heavy duty phone this should be your first choice and also by buying this, you are supporting India and enforcing Boycott Chinese Products movement.\n\n", "\n\n  I have used this phone for about two weeks now.I'm so in love with this phone.PROS1. The battery life is amazing, it has a wonderful standby time.2. Camera is wonderful. The 64mp gives an good finish in the photos.3. The screen is the main plus on this phone, the super AMOLED is good, even if the refresh rate is 60hz it gives a good experience while using.4. Even with 6000amh battery & phone weight of 191grams, the weight is evenly distributed and very comfortable to use.5. The phone comes with a SAMSUNG's own user interface ONE UI 2.0, it gives a premium experience for the user.6. Widevine certification is for this phone.CONS1. There's only 15watts charger given with the phone. 25watts could have be so good(25watts is available in M31s), it roughly take around 2hr 45mins. To get 0% to 100%.2. The processor is Exynos 9611 which is a powerful processor for daily usage. Heavy Gaming with this processor is not advisable. High resolution games are not recommended.3. Low light pictures are average, SAMSUNG should work on that.4. M31 doesn't come with headset or back cover. I paid 17.5k for the phone, I was little bit disappointed when both cover & headset are not includedI will definitely recommend people to buy this phone.\n\n", "\n\n  1. First of all let me tell you that previously I have used Xiaomi Mi A12. I'm writing this review after 9 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. üëç\n\n", '\n\n  This was definetely a great upgrade from Samsung for me as I have been a customer since last 5 years.Highlights for me1.Macro camera-It capture pictures with every minute details.2.64 MP camera-This is something next level as images were size more than 8 mb according to lighting conditions which is equivalent to dslr sizes and detailng is also crystal clear here.Moreover the Monster Battery that stands out over all of these  6000mah,once full charge in the morning can easily run for 2 days. Loved it.\n\n', '\n\n  This phone is worth buying. I will list pros and cons.Here are the pros:1. The very first thing to mention is the camera setup. The image quality is too good in this price range. Both front and rear camera can shoot FHD videos with slomo videos as well. The 64MP shooter does satisfying job.2. Second thing where samsung never disappoints is the 6.4 inches super AMOLED screen which is the best. The colors are very natural and prominent.3. The huge battery is far away from other phone which has endurance of around 1 and half days even after heavy use.4. The exynos 9611 works well for daily use.5. The phone is not at all heavy even if it has huge battery. The weight balance of this phone is great. Thumbs up for that.6. The One UI is the best. It gives a smooth experience on top of android 10.7. Physical fingerprint and face unlock both are fast.Here are the cons:1. First thing, I dont know why samsung is putting the same processor in all of their mid rangers. Though Exynos 9611 does a good job of daily use. But it will disappoint heavy users.2. The macro camera works good in better light conditions, though it is just to attract the customers.3. I have seen some glitches while switching apps. Hopefully samsung will take care of it in sytem updates.4. The speaker is decent but it gets covered while using phone and you may face problems while playing media.5. The deisgn of this phone is not eyecatching but its definitely not bad as reviewers tell.6. Samsung could have provided at least 25W charger. Charging speed is slow but its always a trade-off about what you need.\n\n', "\n\n  Phone model is quite handy.. I got this within 16.5k.. It seems a good buy.The camera is goodBattery is very greatSound is also niceBut my main problem is with the network...the wifi and data connectivity, I face this issue intermittently.  Internet being mandatory  in today's time, this issue is extremely inconvenient. Many people using m31 are facing this issue.*Will update my review once my problem gets resolved.\n\n", '\n\n  I bought this phone on 5th March.  Still working well. As it has been given a 64-megapixcel camera, it is useless to do too much expectation. Some basic features are not available in this phone like pre installed music player and no option available to change the frequency of hotspot tethering. Because of this you will not be able to connect any old version laptop etc through hotspot. Battery performance is good. If we talk about its look, then the back body is not very attractive due to the plastic material body being compared to the equivalent phone available at this time. Still seeing the price range, there is no harm in buying it.  According to me, this is an average smartphone.\n\n', "\n\n  Wow! Finally a budget phone in the mid range packed with features that you generally expect in the realmes or redmis. After using it for good 10 days here's my review:BATTERY LIFE- The battery on this one is the star. This 6000mAh powerhouse does deliver.  Even after 3 hrs of video calling, power consumption is just 20%. Intense gaming, use of camera, e mails,online video playback and lots more, it can handle anything you throw at it. Charging is slow but you have to consider that 6000mAh battery would take some time to charge up. You charge it once  and wouldn't need to do it again for the entire day.2. DISPLAY: In this area also the AMOLED display  will win you over, with the drop notch design is very pleasing to the eyes, colour and contrast are also great.3. CAMERA: The pictures are amazing in bright light,  the wide angle lens also works fine,  however macro or low light pictures may not be up to the mark.  64 MP sensor is not default and have to be changed in the camera settings. But the picture do have great depth, colour, contrast and resolution. The 64 mp camera performs better than other mobile phones in terms of clarity and true colour.OS: Android 10 with Samsung skins.Overall: great product worth purchasing.\n\n", '\n\n  coming from a Samsung S7 Edge, I always wanted a phone with an awesome screen and a good battery life. This phone has them both. Its a bit heavier than the S7 Edge, but it is because of the 6000mah battery. My usage is average and I have never experienced and issue with his one. first charging I felt that the phone was heating but that has stopped after the first software upgrade. Awesome phone for a budget.\n\n', '\n\n  Awesome performance till now. Writing this after 4months of usage. Battery life excellent. Camera quality excellent. Does heat heat up sometimes while charging. Fingerprint reader average if compared to Mi phones. Should be an excellent purchase for a moderate user.\n\n', "\n\n  Awesome performance, I have used this mobile for almost 4 months and after that I'm sharing my view on this.Pros:Good Camera (In day light)Best batteryVery good performanceNever get hangAwesome UITimely android updates and patch upCons:Take more than 2 hours to fully chargeModerate camera performance in low lightLittle bulky when compare to other same range mobilesOverall it provide a good support in the given price band. Everyone has their own priority based on that one may like or not. This review is based on my priority and experience.\n\n", '\n\n  Handson experience after 10 days.Really disappointing product from Samsung. This is utlra hyped product. Its a marketing stratagy of samsung to promote it. Only battery is the feature of the phone which last around 1.5 days on heavy usage. i am a game freak and it is good for that.The camera is pathetic mark my word pathetic its a 8 megapixel camera which they branding as 64 megapixel. when you zoom after cl8cking a photo there is no details. its all blurred out and you feel cheated like anything. the selfie camera sucks. Overall experience is bitter. I really dont like the smartphone. it is all plastic body and quite compressable. I have oppo reno phone i felt it is 1000% guinine than this cheating phone. Be aware before you buy. 2 star is only for battrry only battrry.\n\n', "\n\n  The battery life of this product is best so far even with heavy usage and gaming the battery stays for more than a dayCamera quality is amazingIt's not very heavy and has a sleek designSamsung has kept its focus on the cameras as the Galaxy M31 touts a 64MP quad camera setup. Other key Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications include a Super AMOLED display, 6,000mAh battery and Android 10 softwareThe front of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is familiar as well, as you're greeted by a 6.4-inch full HD+ (2,340 x 1,080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display, much like its predecessors. The display gets a U-shaped notch up top that houses a selfie camera and a fairly thick chin.Thanks to a glossy rear panel, the Galaxy M31 is a fingerprint and smudge magnet, something which is quite noticeable on the black colour variant that we received for review. Moreover, the rear panel attracts scratches if you place it on a table or in your pocket along with some keys.This mobile is the best in affordable range\n\n", "\n\n  1) Heating issue can be experienced frequently while using YouTube, downloading, uploading, updates and during charging. Few restrictions of disabling location and background apps when not in use reduces the heating issues.2) huge 6000 Mah battery but backup not up to the mark as it should be. Similar backup in my previous vivo with 3400 mah battery.3) camera 64MP but similar quality pics compared to other 48MP pics of vivo and realme.Except above, the phone is nice and good option if you don't want to purchase Chinese brands as in my case.4) very long charging time more than 2.5 hrs. It should be made fast by samsung.5) should be provided with  in box accessories like screen guard, earphones.6) backcover to be made more attractive and qualityOverall phone is good with nice display, camera features, good pics, good video recording.\n\n", '\n\n  The features provided in the phone are good but what broke my trust from samsung is that despite having a 6GB RAM, i see some glitch while using this phone. There is bit of a lag while using this phone which is seriously not expected from samsung. I am disappointed in samsung on buying this product.\n\n', "\n\n  \xa0Honesty saying I'm totally satisfied and happy with this one. All in all everything is great, the interface, the display and the battery is to die for, and as for the camera the video and picture quality is also great, it lags only when it comes to night camera as it takes a bit of time to getting used to, like initially I thought the night photos looked like some oil pastel painting but now after the update and some use it's better. The features are very nice too.I also used redmi 9 pro max as I ordered that one before so I can say that I've had the opposite to compare both and I found the samsung m31 a lot more better than the redmi set which had some heating issues and some kind of camera launching issue.The super amoled display is awesome, it is a very good looking smart phone, the battery can last up upto 36 to 40 hours and it takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to charge completely from zero to hunder. The camera quality is also very good and have many additional available options and features.The processor is very efficient as I've played many games without facing any lag or problem, also I binge watch for long hours and the experience is great.\n\n", '\n\n  After almost a month of standard use. I must say I am happy with the battery life, it lasts almost two days. The touch is butter smooth. A good and bright display. The finger print is super fast. The camera quality could have been better, not happy with it. As I owned a Lumia 950 earlier, I still feel the display and camera of Lumia is better than this one.\n\n', '\n\n  \xa0camera is awesome...battery is very nice..I  satisfied by this product.....\n\n', '\n\n  The best budget phone no smartphone can match. Imagine a battery that needs no charging. Lol. At least two days.What camera? Wow...Speed...how many cores...just like boss ...wow...I just hate samsung UI...let android UI be. I shifted from Xiaomi, honor and iPhone.. But never had issues but with this phone I have to unlearn every android or iOS simplicity. Samsung UI is complex. I just have to ask Google everytime for small things like finger print gestures.All in all I would unlearn everything ahhahahah...thanks samsung!!!!\n\n', "\n\n  Pros:1. First time sAmoled user, this screen is so great. When you low the brightness then it actually become very low which is good in night. In sunlight it glows.2. Colors are so vibrant and good that i just look at the 4k videos and just keep admiring its quality.3. Touch is so smooth that it feels very light.4. Android 10 is a charm. Loads of functionality. And that too very useful.5. Battery couldn't be more great. Though it takes time to charge but once charged then it goes all day night long.6. Sound is superb. Speaker are crisp clear audio without any glitch. Call quality is great. I can talk so easily now.7. Dolby Atmos is a charm. Its headphones sound quality is super.8. Camera is great. It captures details. Although its not a dslr but its good.9. Build quality couldn't be better. Gorilla glass makes it more good.Cons:1. Battery charger is very low like 15w which is below market standards.2. Top notch could have been more smaller like a dot display.3. Processer are low end.4. Front camera lacks quality\n\n", '\n\n  I won\'t bore you with the techie stuff in the beginning..that will come later on...PS:go towards the end of the comment if you wanna have a detailed review.Overall a good phone , good performance ( it\'s been 1 month since I\'ve been using the phone) .A very good alternative to Chinese phones you can control a huge number of ads i.e no vulgar ads popping on your notification list in the morning..thank god for that.I just have one complaint the back got scratched in this one month.. so buy a cover along with the phone.The boring techie analysis:The phone has improved 64MP quad rear camera,8MP for extra wide angle shorts,5MP for macro photos and 5MP for depth and 32MP front facing camera A rear  mounted finger scanner which works amazingly... Now comming to the screen, the phone comes with FHD 6.4" super AMOLED infinity display  with infinity-U cut this is a full HD display with amazing screen quality.Internals:It works on 1UI version2 i.e. Android 10With Exynos 9611 octacore processor with10nm.Finally 6000mAh battery USB-C Port and Samsung\'s 15Watt adaptive fast charging\n\n', '\n\n  Good phone I like it very much because of its camera and battery life and also it has many great features . It has smart look, beautiful design,sleekness.overall it is a very useful product for me.camera is too good for taking pictures. It has very nice fingerprint sensor. It has also other intellegent options like hand Screenshot. Facereader is very good option for unlocking the phone.\n\n', '\n\n  Dont go for the negative reviews, they have been written by the noobs who dont know how to adjust settings. Coming to the point. It is decent phone (not a very great one) but i was tired of Ads in my previous realme phone so i bought this.Pros-BatteryCameraDisplayUIPricingSamsung BrandNo AdsCons-Facelock is not goodspeakers are averageprocessor is not comparable to industry standard ( but any game can be smoothly played on it )\n\n', '\n\n  A marvelous phone at great price which can compete with any phone in its category in all aspects and can beat them hands down. Long battery life to sustain for more than one and a half day, responsive fingerprint reader including retinal scan and a great camera to shoot at various angles.  The nail in the coffin is that its NON CHINESE and this is the minimum we can do to support the cause in such a situation. Only one demerit is that its slightly heavy, may be due to 6000 mah bty. Overall a highly recommended budget phone.\n\n', '\n\n  My mom has been constantly complaining of issues with the phone, i.e. like the phone keyboard sometimes not responding to touch, the audio jack breaking the earphone sound, the fingerprint not always responding. Or not getting the calls over whats-app.She has used Android phones for a long time already.So i think most could be software problems, so i installed appropriate once for her to make it work better. I am still looking up on the internet if the phone has some persistent hardware or software issues, like with the wifi card because of which intermittent connectivity problems could occur.The phone works fairly fine when i am using it.\n\n', "\n\n  Fingerprint reader at a weird place, if you use covers it'll be even more difficult to use.Fairly good face detection, so I use that often to unlock phone. Though difficult to detect when in dark.Super artificially enhanced and processed output from both the cameras. Would love some naturals captures that's just impossible. Not a good camera. Aap you can see in the first picture, the room is moderately lit but image is pretty bright, the details are lacking and the image is not as sharp. The second image is of outdoors, good lighting and a little enhanced colours, though if I zoom in the picture will be distorted and lacks details, which is not expected from a 64 mp camera.Amazing display, lovely colours. Same goes with the touch.Battery lasts for well more than a day on moderate usage with data on all day long, which is great.Performance is good, not best not poor either.Don't play games at all, no clue/opinion about it.Great after sales service, I received a call to check in and review the device. Looking forward to get some significant improvements in upcoming products.\n\n", '\n\n  Reviewing After 1Month of Use..Huge battery of 6000mAhüò±..after full charge it give a backup of nearly 22 hrs (based on how u use)Amoled screen is just phenomenalüî•..(u can\'t question it..) even in sunlight it works perfectlyüíØ...Camera quality is good‚ù§Ô∏è as per price..(and in this price range I just Love its camera)Speakers are loud enough..audio output is good..I tried heavy gaming in this (which I don\'t usually playüòÖ) and the phone works perfectly fine...It is obvious one may find phone a little weighted bcoz of heavy battery..What I don\'t like is the "15w charger"üòñ(It takes 120 - 150 min to get full charge)I mean with such a huge battery of 6000mAh company should provide a 25w charger..\n\n', "\n\n  A good budget phone with some pretty decent features.I've used it for almost 10days. So according to me the pros and cons are listed below.Pros-----* Color reproduction of camera is nice and display the almost accurate colors.* Video stabilization is up to the mark* Amoled screens are always glamorizing* AI battery optimization (depending on your usage pattern the battery will auto optimize. It'll take some to time to learn the pattern)* Many levels of customization including fonts, themes, gestures, etc.* Processor is good enough to handle day to day multitasking. I don't play games on regular basis but games like pubg, asphalt and cod are playble (at 45-60fps). Some graphics tweaks will boost the performance.* Single speaker but loud enough for basic usageCons------* Charging takes almost 2h 45m to boost from 0 to 100.* Night mode could be optimized.Go for this phone if you're looking for a budget phone with decent features, good security patterns, long battery life and an amazing camera for outdoor and selfie shots.Note: This phone may not be suitable for gamers due to the exonys Processor. According to the benchmarks it's more powerful than a SD 675 but slower than SD 720. Go for phones with 720G or 730G.#MadeInIndia\n\n"]
