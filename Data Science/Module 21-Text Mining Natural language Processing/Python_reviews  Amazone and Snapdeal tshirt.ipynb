       "  Pros:<br/><br/>1. First time sAmoled user, this screen is so great. When you low the brightness then it actually become very low which is good in night. In sunlight it glows.<br/><br/>2. Colors are so vibrant and good that i just look at the 4k videos and just keep admiring its quality.<br/><br/>3. Touch is so smooth that it feels very light.<br/><br/>4. Android 10 is a charm. Loads of functionality. And that too very useful.<br/><br/>5. Battery couldn't be more great. Though it takes time to charge but once charged then it goes all day night long.<br/><br/>6. Sound is superb. Speaker are crisp clear audio without any glitch. Call quality is great. I can talk so easily now.<br/><br/>7. Dolby Atmos is a charm. Its headphones sound quality is super.<br/><br/>8. Camera is great. It captures details. Although its not a dslr but its good.<br/><br/>9. Build quality couldn't be better. Gorilla glass makes it more good.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1. Battery charger is very low like 15w which is below market standards.<br/><br/>2. Top notch could have been more smaller like a dot display.<br/><br/>3. Processer are low end.<br/><br/>4. Front camera lacks quality\n",

       "  Fingerprint reader at a weird place, if you use covers it'll be even more difficult to use.<br/><br/>Fairly good face detection, so I use that often to unlock phone. Though difficult to detect when in dark.<br/><br/>Super artificially enhanced and processed output from both the cameras. Would love some naturals captures that's just impossible. Not a good camera. Aap you can see in the first picture, the room is moderately lit but image is pretty bright, the details are lacking and the image is not as sharp. The second image is of outdoors, good lighting and a little enhanced colours, though if I zoom in the picture will be distorted and lacks details, which is not expected from a 64 mp camera.<br/><br/>Amazing display, lovely colours. Same goes with the touch.<br/><br/>Battery lasts for well more than a day on moderate usage with data on all day long, which is great.<br/><br/>Performance is good, not best not poor either.<br/><br/>Don't play games at all, no clue/opinion about it.<br/><br/>Great after sales service, I received a call to check in and review the device. Looking forward to get some significant improvements in upcoming products.\n",

       "  A good budget phone with some pretty decent features.<br/>I've used it for almost 10days. So according to me the pros and cons are listed below.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-----<br/>* Color reproduction of camera is nice and display the almost accurate colors.<br/>* Video stabilization is up to the mark<br/>* Amoled screens are always glamorizing<br/>* AI battery optimization (depending on your usage pattern the battery will auto optimize. It'll take some to time to learn the pattern)<br/>* Many levels of customization including fonts, themes, gestures, etc.<br/>* Processor is good enough to handle day to day multitasking. I don't play games on regular basis but games like pubg, asphalt and cod are playble (at 45-60fps). Some graphics tweaks will boost the performance.<br/>* Single speaker but loud enough for basic usage<br/><br/>Cons<br/>------<br/>* Charging takes almost 2h 45m to boost from 0 to 100.<br/>* Night mode could be optimized.<br/><br/>Go for this phone if you're looking for a budget phone with decent features, good security patterns, long battery life and an amazing camera for outdoor and selfie shots.<br/><br/>Note: This phone may not be suitable for gamers due to the exonys Processor. According to the benchmarks it's more powerful than a SD 675 but slower than SD 720. Go for phones with 720G or 730G.<br/><br/>#MadeInIndia\n",

Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7.

Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps.

One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.\\n\\n\",\n",

Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.\\n\\n',\n",

Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex\\n\\n',\n",

I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos.

No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive..

Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...\\n\\n\",\n",

Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.\\n\\n\",\n",

Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜).

       " \"\\n\\n  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)\\n\\n\",\n",

Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.

Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces.

It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better.

I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP.

       " \"\\n\\n  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  It is not 10 days that i have got this phone. But having issues in hearing some one talk from the other side or at times, the other person on the call cannot hear you. it is clear that the microphone are bad and not serving the purpose of a phone. When you play music, you can see that the volume of the song just fading off and at a point you just cannot hear any noise from the phone.When I try to return the phone its asking to install a smart check app and only if the app says there is some defect, they would take the phone back. If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one.And another point to note is that, I trusted that I would be happy with this phone, hence had purchased a special phone cover. now that money is also a waste.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  sir, I  purchased the mobile with much excitement that it would provide a wonderful experience but actually the product is not worth purchasing. After using the phone for 3 to 4 weeks the system asked for an update of the software but as soon as I downloaded the update and installed it. My mobile crashed and I can do nothing on the phone. It is neither getting switched off nor restarted. So what type of help you can provide me in this regard. I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.\\n\\n\",\n",

So we understand these things, there\\'s no such thing as \"gorilla vorilla\" it\\'s a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you\\'ll have to pay for this.\"I can\\'t believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this \"insider\" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  This is the Galaxy M31 review after a week use.Bought this phone to replace my existing iPhone SE after watching so many videos of tech reviews which are continuously bashing Apple for providing low specs mobiles. After a week, I realised that I made severe mistake by acknowledging their words. The 64 MP camera is nowhere near my 4 year old iPhone’s 12 MP camera. Macro camera is another joke in this package.Performance:  Galaxy M31 has ‘so called’ 6 GB RAM but works like 100MB RAM device. 3 GB RAM will always be occupied and you can’t do anything about that. Say what, you are free to use 3 GB RAM only. Even my Windows 10 OS use only 1.5 GB RAM. And even my older Moto E ( yes, Moto E) works better than this phone in scrolling through internet. About gaming, it’s bad joke. My 4 years old iPhone SE runs seamlessly even in 2GB RAM.Tech people always boast about Android that it’s customisable. What customisation would serve if your phone is not even working properly? You aren’t even allowed to uninstall Netflix and they keep talking about customisations.Battery life is pretty good though. At least they did good in this case. 6000mAh lives for 1.5 to 2 days in normal use.Another feature provided with this phone is heating. Just some normal activities will heat up your Galaxy M31 so much that you can pretty much use it as heater in winters. Not joking here.I bought 64 GB variant, and only 47 GB was usable. Android system is taking 13-14 GB in the system. Really?Overall, not happy with purchase. Waste of 16.5K with this garbage product.Samsung, you can so way better than this!!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Very bad product. There are so many issue.1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.3. Sound is also not good.4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone. Samsung  are fooling the amezon customer.Don't buy.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  From the user of Samsung Guru 1200, Metro duos C3322, Mertro XL, Galaxy On5 Pro to this Galaxy M31 & going to use Note series after some months & as a Samsung fan I'm honestly writing this review. This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone. Touchscreen is too much sensitive but this sAMOLED screen is just superb, awesome and 6000mAh battery will give you a long lasting usage after one full charge. Otherwise it's an all in one phone.The new problem which I'm facing now(after using it 2 months) is, if the data connection is on with 1st SIM and at that time if any SMS comes to 2nd SIM then the data connection get lost fully until I active the airplane mode & then deactivate it. It makes a lot of problem during banking transactions with OTPs.\\n\\n\",\n",

And it takes more than 2.5 hrs say 3 hrs as per my personal experience.Camera is good.Battery is a nightmare if u want to keep it charging after every 2 hrs than go ahead .and last time i gave 2 stars..

Samsung simply cheat you and looting you.I must said please don't waste your money on waste galaxy m31 because at this price you have very better option available in market. Samsung also leak and stole our data as like other companies so their is no difference between Chinese company and Samsung.

The phone is powered by Octa core (2.3 GHz, Quad core, Cortex A73 + 1.7 GHz, Quad core, Cortex A53) processor. It runs on the Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 Chipset. It has 6 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage.Samsung Galaxy M31 smartphone has a Super AMOLED display. It measures 159.2 mm x 75.1 mm x 8.9 mm and weighs 191 grams.

Best feature  is it touch,processor and camera with effective  rate\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.Now coming to the phone :Pros :-1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The phone looks and feels good in the hand. All the gimmicks while setting up the phone would make one feel happy about buying the phone. Now let's get to the tall claims by Samsung basis which one has spent 17K.First of all I received a phone which when switched on went directly to system reboot mode. That was the first shock! The others are described next.Finger print reader is slow at times and one has to place the finger a couple of times to unlock the phone.Battery Life is lower than a 3000mah. Yes, one would get a longer battery life out of this phone if left unused and that is precisely what it hasn't been purchased for.Camera Quality is bad, very bad. The pictures are so grainy and pixelated. Had a Moto G4 plus before this and the picture quality from the camera was awesome.Feel cheated by Samsung for palming off such poor quality device for INR 17K. I want a refund.Amazon, I am aware that this review will go through a review by your team. Please take note and help initiate a return and refund so that I can buy a better device worth its value.

       " '\\n\\n  Fair review after one week of usage:Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.6. Battery life is quite very good.7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.5. The charging is a bit slow.6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.7. The sound output could have been more.8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Initial reviewPerformance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.After one week of usageif the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.Facial recognition takes a lot of timeConclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme\\n\\n\",\n",

EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCTNow with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I have noticed below issues with phone.* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.Also battery drains out easily* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!======================================================================================Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after more than a month of usage:- The phone heats up during charging.- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  \\xa0The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.I purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.I have used the camera in the last 5 months. The results are very satisfactory. There may be some limitations in low light photography, but with a little tweaking, you get good results.\\n\\n\",\n",

I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person’s voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn’t show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don’t have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand.

I am enjoying using this mobile.Pros:* camera: video and image quality and available modes are too good at this price. It's good to have a 64MP camera. It works well in night light also.* Battery life is good.* No heating issues found while using and charging, unlike redmi mobiles.* No need of unnecessary mandatory apps installation like in redmi.* I feel like this mobiles  GUI is amazing and better than Redmi mobiles GUI (maybe because I got bored using redmi mobiles??).* Dolby sound system is too good. You can feel the difference if you compare audio quality with other mobile phones audio.* Smart switch app from Samsung helps to copy all the data from your previous mobile to this one. It's a good feature.* This mobile operates so smoothly.*Amoled display is amazing.Cons:* Face unlock system sometimes fails in darkness. Samsung should have worked on this feature pre-release. But it works fine in daylight.Overall a good experience and recommended product.Just a suggestion, if you are buying this mobile please spend 500 more bucks and buy Spigen back cover, mobile looks elegant with it. You will love your mobile more. Dont go for cheap quality back covers. You will regret it later.Update: After using it for 1 month, I have found that the internet speed is bit low when compared to other mobiles and sometimes internet disconnects automatically for some seconds.\\n\\n\",\n",

And also company given 6gb ram when you play online games , games will lack too badly. Maybe companies fault . Lots friends said after samsung is not a. Good phone for roughly use. This is ladies phone. Really I am agry for this. I got lots of problems. Even I didn't go for return coz from the next day lockdown also started.\\n\\n\",\n",

Front camera is worse camera but with update it get little better. we can't turn on flast while wide angle photo It is not even week since I bought , suddenly screen touch stop working , can't restart or do anything on it . Lying useless at moment . Shame on you Samsung .\\n\\n\",\n",

The hardware supports this feature but Samsung has not activated th CA feature. Even my two year old moto had this!

Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide-angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. I may not require to carry my DSLR everywhere.Delivery was fast, packing was good,I share my experience with my friend they also buy this same product and also happy.Good:- Wi-Fi Calling Facility is to good.- The display is excellent with Blue light filter.- The performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery (More than 1.5 Days running with Internet)- 512 GB Memory card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is goodBuild Quality:This phone is fully made of plastic but the build quality is good. The back of the phone looks like glass but it also made from plastic so it scratches easily.

       " \"\\n\\n  I recently purchased an M21 for my father and was more than happy with its overall performance, be it the camera, battery or software performance. Hence, decided to upgrade my mother's phone as well and Samsung M series being Proudly Made in India and a non Chinese but a Korean brand, ordered the M31 128GB.To my surprise, I was even more amazed when the phone arrived. Everything the M21 was best at, was carried over and the Camera performance was even more improved in every aspect.The sharpness, AF, colours, and also video performance was improved over M21 which itself is good.No wonder the phone is selling like hot cakes all over India. My only regret now is, I didnt knew the M31s was launching. Else I would have waited for the M31s which going by the reviews, is a monster in Camera segment.Anyway, since my moms and dads phones have been set and purchased already, I think I need a phone upgrade for myself and it sure will be a Samsung. Probably the upcoming A71S 5G or an A51s 5G since i have read up about the about to be released Samsung phones.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Good phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good.

Keeps you going all day!Camera quality is awesome and comes with many cool features also!

Using it for three months now. Smooth and perfect.PA: no proper cover available. I wish samsung provided it.even if for extra cost with high quality for protection.Couldn't find any till date. Help me if someone has recommendations.:(\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera ReviewThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.Galaxy M31That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security ReviewGalaxy M31The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance ReviewGalaxy M31The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone10. Night mode photos are stunning. The first photo given above is of Hyderabad nightline, taken from my balcony.11. Next two photos are of clouds taken from an Indigo flight.12. Next snap is of cardamom flowers in my garden.13. The last one is pav baked by me at home. Snap taken with Food Mode.

Select to speak options hangs frequently and the phone becomes unaccessible.after my purchase there was a software update due to which my screen gets zoom automatically creating problem while using which is very irritating face recognition is not that good phone takes two and a half hour to charge completely.Camera is really nice beautiful pictures come out.\\n\\n',\n",

It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.

Just remember to apply correct settings.Front camera photos looks awesome.Phone performance is also very good. Very smooth controls and the screen quality is also very good.Sound quality is also up to the markThe phone has an excellent sensor coordination for everything.It also has a virtual proximity sensor and an AR support from Google with an excellent gyro sensor.The fingerprint sensor is also very fast.The face unlock feature is above everything.It detects face automatically when your phone is kept upright even without turning screen on. It will detect your face and automatically turn on.The look of the phone is also very nice with a glassy look on back.This is a power packed phone which will always win over any phone in this price range.I think everyone should try this experience.I trust Samsung and still I think it is better to buy a Samsung phone than to buy other phones even if they are offering some more features.I am very happy to write this review.I think this review you make impact a bit.Just stop here and buy this product.After using it you would be feel that your decision was right.Thank you for reading my review till last.\\n\\n',\n",

Also around 3 hours of Google map use.Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  It is a best budget phone with the amount of provided specs in it, having a massive battery of 6000mah gave me a decent backup of upto 2 days, if you are a average user then this is a phone you want, I played all types of games in it from ludo to asphalt 9 and pubg but it stood up to its name as not much of battery drain but minute lags were observed at the start but later on after few second everything got ok, adaptive brightness is very good but was not working some times had to manually set it but sometimes switching it off and on came as a solution, fingerprint sensor is quick but some times doesn't works if it is a bit dusty, also if you hands are wet it will take multiple attempts before giving access, most of the reviews I read about back panel color and material quality was negative as compared with other phones but personally i liked the color of back panel as I have the ocean blue you can call me old fashioned but there are many reasons like 1. It looks good,  2. Doesn't slips from you hand 3. Eventually you are going to use a back cover with it and etc, I have a transparent back cover over mine coz no other color would be that good as it's original, its display is one of the best as the picture quality and the color contrast and many other aspects cannot be compared with other phones in market, it also provided built in Dolby atmos when using earphone which totally changes the experience of audio while watching movies or listening songs its is just amazing, I was averagely satisfied with the camera as the night mode is not that good when compared with other phones, macro shots are very good but struggles a bit to focus, I did not find any much difference between slow mo and ultra slow mo, providing inbuilt custom stickers and emoji are good and enjoyable, speaker volume are good for a average noisy room conditions but not for listening songs outdoors, there are many gestures which takes time to get comfortable with but once you are life gets easier also there are many other features which proved helpful for day to day working environment, over all it is a best phone for average and heavy usage until and unless you are planning to play heavy games on it entire day long with heavy graphics requirementThank you 😁\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage.

       " \"\\n\\n  My review after using the phone after 4 months of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.Pros:1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.6. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.Cons:-1. Night mode isn’t the best.2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.3. It doesn't come with earphones.4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.Conclusion:-If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.Regards,Yash\\n\\n\",\n",

Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone.

       " '\\n\\n  Its almost 3 months now. Giving review about this phone:PROS:1) Made In India, in Noida factory.2) Very good touch screen. You don\\'t require screen guard, as its scratch resistant/scratch free.3) Superb battery life.4) Doesn\\'t get heated after prolonged use.CONS:1) It doesn\\'t have block number feature with prefix pattern. You have to add individual numbers. E.g. you know call starting with 140 are all advertisement calls. You can\\'t ignore them simply by adding 140*, you have to individually add. Trucaller has this feature, but you require to install this 3rd party APP.2) SAMSUNG claims its a 15W charger. But if you know Wattage is Volt X Current. Its 5V, 2A charger, that is 10W. In short its weaker charger than what company claims.3) Its touch screen is very sensitive. If soap water etc gets on to the screen then even after cleaning by cloth, screen doesn\\'t respond for long time. \"Accidental touch feature\" if you put ON then especially you get into this issue.Overall:Overall for this range with brand like SAMSUNG, its definately a good BUY. Much better than Chinese phones.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  A very disappointing buy.I've been using this phone for about 3 days, which is enough to know how the phone performs, and this phone is sub-standard. Let me list the reasons why:1. To begin with the finger print scanner response is very slow. Very often it doesn't recognize the finger.2. With a big battery I was expecting it to.last a day. But with playing light games like Temple Run and Words wirh Friends the battery runs down very quickly. It also takes a little over 3 hours to charge fully.3. Camera performance is pathetic. The 64mp pics look like it's been shot with 8mph lens. And don't even try a pic at night, you won't be able to see anything with clarity.4. The phone feels heavy and cumbersome though it's hardly a few gms heavier than my previous phone.5. The volume buttons are stiff and don't respond to a normal touch.6. The swipe hand gesture to take a screenshot is useless as very often the screen moves along with the hand gesture of you're taking a screenshot on a webpage or Instagram or any other social media app.And though I have more to say, I think this is enough to dissuade you from buying this phone. I'd suggest you go for either the Realme 6 or the Note 9 Pro at the same price.\\n\\n\",\n",

This was my first online purchase of this value and had concerns there. But was delighted as everything went smooth. There was a delivery OTP provided by Amazon hence the delivery person had to deliver to me in person which was good. I was worried that he shouldn't leave it with security in my absence. 2nd, the seller had packed it nicely, the primary pack seal by the manufacturer was intact hence a genuine new pack. Overall, had a great experience - product, delivery and the  seller.\\n\\n\",\n",

I was Iphone user and seriously I purchased this phone to get more handy with android OS.Camera: Too good. Many options and works in almost all condition.Sound: Dolby supports to Bluetooth and wired headphones. AmazingDisplay: No competition.. sAMOLED is doing its best. The contrast is such black even you cant make difference between the body black color and the screen black color. Phone looks very nice when I use dark mode.Battery: Monster battery, full usage will give you 1 and half day life. if average use then it will last for 2 days.Charging Cable: it is only 0.5 Meter, Samsung why why are you giving such small length wire? how much are you saving 50 INR? Also i found the charging cable is with poor quality.No Case: Generally silicon case we get by 150 INR outside, samsung would have given it then it was good. but its not there in box.Overall this product is superb choise if you have budget under 20K (for this variant of 8GB RAM 128 GN Storage)\\n\\n',\n",

I am not the Cheapo kind who takes selfies and uses a lot of Tik Tok so camera is not a big deal for me But the camera  is real good HDR pics are nice and slow mo and time lapse are amazing. Live focus is a amazing feature in camera. Sound quality is awesome and better than redmi note 6 pro which i was using earlier. Good snappy phone for daily app usage. I don't waste my time on games so no comments. UI is good with ease of use all around. Love the AOD display.Bought a sandisk type C usb otg but it didnt show in storage.

Highly reliable. It was time to change my old 3G Samsung mobile. Finally I settled for this one.Why M31?In my professional life, I worked on R&D, and fabrication of VLSIs. That made me a perfectionist in the field of photography. So  I was looking for an affordable mobile phone as an aid to my DSLRs. This M31 met all my expectations.The Samsung M31.The high-resolution front and quad-camera system at the rear. Excellent exposure sytem. Brilliant colour rendition. All these through world class Samsung display.The hardware is perfectly matched with its operating syste. I was amazed using its never-used-before features.

Battery life of the phone is awesome. On medium usage it lasts for 2 days. The charging time is 2.5 hours though, which a bit high for charging 6000mAh battery.2. Screen, colors and resolution all are a masterclass.  Samsung and its screen are the best thing to have. There is some bezel in the screen and I didn't like the idea of curving screen at the corners. It is manageable though.3. Touch and keypad are good and responsive.Cons1. Processor on the slower side. Good for its category but definitely not the best.2. I didn't like the build quality of the phone.  While the shape is sharp and finish is good, I find the phone little bit bulky.3. The menu and options are not the most user friendly. I used an Oxygen os before and believe me it was much smooth in sorting things.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Camera: 3.8/5Battery: 5/5UI: 5/5Fingerprint reader: 4/5Screen: 5/5The first and foremost reason to buy it is that its not a China brand. Had a Mi phone which stopped working after 7 months had to visit service centre to replace battery which has warranty of 6 months. Charged me Rs.1880 for it. After raise issue to Mi CS atleast they refunded my Rs. 524.Now, about M31 if you looking for decent phone with Amoled screen and bigger battery this the phone for you.For some people not having glass body may feel like a deal breaker but for me whi has used a glass body phone with back cover doesn't feel like much difference, phone is 90% of time in back cover.Camera id descent for thus price range, won't  say the best but gives satisfactory results and quad camera setup many more options to play with.Samsung needs to upgrade from 9611 processor but still for a user like me it doesn't  make any difference.Any body looking to buy a new phone can wait and buy M31s which has a better charging and screen.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This review is for users who mostly use mobile for calls, watching videos, some social media and photography!!Looks: This phone is Huge! For watching videos it is fun but handling it can be tricky... Plastic back is fingerprint magnet so cover is recommended.Screen: stunner! Big screen + amoled is great combination! Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.Always on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.Battery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.Few hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays)I am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.Charging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%(Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.)Performance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.Camera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.Attached some sample shots.Macro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.Wide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.Selfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.Video recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!Summary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt. Had to uninstall it manually)\\n\\n\",\n",

But after 1 month I chage my mind and believe it's one of good phone cader. Not bad as wat I have written below( my early review)Battery back up is too good and performance wise to its a MONSTER. Camera too good. The only area in which the phone lage is loud speaker. That they have to improve.👍👍👍👍🤳Thx allMy early review👇Very much Disappointed  with the product M31 I was previously  using MI A2. I bought this after so much research from review from Amazon.  The major disappointment was with speakers both loud speakers & phone speakers  quality  is not at all acceptable. Very cheap sounds never ever I used it before in my entire life time.I play free fire ( only game I have in my mobile)In MIA2 (6GB Ram ,128 storage ) I never got up hang my mobile. But in case of M31 (8GB RAM 128 STORAGE) I got hang every time 🤣🤣🤣If you have other options plz go for it. I will never come back to Samsung in my life time.I hesitate to go for redmi before I  buy MiA2. This time too I thought to for Mi. Still gone for Samsung. But it proved me wrong.\\n\\n\",\n",

I feel this instrument is having all necessary features in this price range for those who believe in smart work and nice user interface.I liked the most..- Android 10! Latest looks & works Beautiful...ahead of all- One UI is the superb experience as compared to other ones which are cheap. Feel the REAL look and damn useful features required for what is called as SMART WORK- Dark Mode is the best feature I wish for- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging.- 6000 mh battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support VoLTE...i really appreciate this- The Mobile Mic and speaker is good and clear- Camera is really good.  Video stabilization option is excellent- Face unlock, figure-print sensor response is quickAdditional requirement- I wish Samsung should provide a screen guard and back cover along with the handset. This is very good business trend and customer convenience. This will also help to protect the instrument from Day1 of usage.Finally the icing on the cake is..If you are thinking to buy a new phone, you can always consider this on priority being proudly Made In India. The day is not so away...MONSTER will surely beat the DRAGON\\n\\n\",\n",

People used to super bright screens will not like it.2. The max brightness is also not as much as other good quality phones.3. Battery life is ok at best. But that is because of Samsung os. You can enable it to kill more apps to preserve battery.4. Samsung one os is ok ok. Lacks many things in 2020! Scrollable wallpapers missing on home screen. Sms and calling app look outdated. App launcher is also ok ok. No issues have installed nova launcher. Can also recommend lawnchair.5. Sar value is low, so range is not max always. Some basic issues with wifi tooHope samsung will fix color tint issue and other os issues.So at almost 20k not worth it. But hey I bought it because it is not a Chinese phone.

It took me 2 hours to charge the phone from 20 to 100%, which is decent considering that the charger is a 15W one. The camera quality is really good, and although I have only taken photos of my answer scripts so far, I am looking forward to taking more photos with it. The processor is also great and it has been able to handle moderate levels of multitasking with ease. The display is bright and vibrant, and the sound quality is really good.

And amazon support is worst, they are not returning the phone even within 4 days of purchase. Samsung customer care executives are telling me to come to service centre, why did I buy a phone if I had to go to service centre with 4 day of purchase.  Phone hangs even if you use Instagram for 30 min. Bad processor.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Starting with display as its sAMOLED its great.Camera 64MP main shooter is awesome, great details and color reporduction , slefie is nice too, ultra wide depth and macro works as described but main highlght is 64 MP which actualy is great.Battery life is superb but takes 2:30+ to charge from 10 to 100.Perfomance of 9611 is very nice, it does not lag in daily uses. PUBG in HD and ultra or HD smooth works very good for long hours of play. HDR with ultra lags sometimes. But HD ultra is the best setting for 1 hour of gaming.Last is build quality, i have blue and i thought it might look cheap plastic as seen in pictures , but blue looks semi premium , its not thick or bulky, when u have in hand its great.it does not have NFC so if you are in use of it then go for A51 else M31 is actualy a good deal . Totaly worthit and plus  samsung brand. Also note samsung has improved  a lot in updates. Plus no advertisements.\\n\\n',\n",

The main thing processor and ram management is also fine as mated with 8gb, but it's not meant for heavy gaming. As i play pubg and all.. fame do drop sometimes as i've noticed, which was not the story with my asus 5z 8gb variant, i miss that phone.But in terms of battery it's surely a deal breaker!

I changed my mind.. and started looking for a made in india device.. samsung m31 is the one you are looking for under 20000. I have the 128+6 gb version.. the battery is super cool.. camera is also decent even in the night time. The night mode captures decent photos at night. The processor is decent and handle the apps pretty good.. despite of having a huge battery the phone is comparatively lite.. and it feels comfortable because of the edge on the side.. it helps in the better grip. Super amoled display is just wow.. better colours..accurate sharpness. Overall the phone is very good.. go for it without any doubtI hope this review is helpful.\\n\\n',\n",

Speaker quality is okay but if you use headphone for music or watching your latest show this will be of your least concern.

       " \"\\n\\n  This is a short review after the first 24 hours of the M31 6GB 128GB black color phone I have bought. I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks  (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone,  buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly.  This is huge.So should you buy M31? Unless you are a high end gamer the answer is YES.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I am using Samsung Galaxy M31 last 10 days. I feel I made best choice this time.1. Android v10.0 OS with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor really good performance. No lagging.2. Excellent Display. Blue ligth filter is cool.3. 6000 mah battery is very usefull for continuous user like me. Fast charging & no heating problem.4. Camera is good. Macro performance is very good. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.5. Both dedicated sim slots support LTE.6. Mobile speakers sound is good but when I use earphone I am not getting full clarity.7. Finger print sensor response is compartively very good.8. When I ordered phone I was thinking it is big size but it is very handy..!9. Storage expandable upto 512GB is really usefull.I feel phone is really worth for the price & you may like to use it. Without doubt you may order.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.\\n\\n',\n",

Battery backup in average moderate usage will not last even a complete full day by the end of the your battery percentage will be around 15 to 20. Which is really disappointing.  Trust me my honor 8x mobile with just 3450 mah battery gives a similar back up. What is the point of buying such a phone then. Camera is good. Low light capture is efficient enough at this price range. Finger print sensor is okay. Not great as my honor 8x has a lightning fast finger 3sensor when compared to Samsung. Also I found a sense of lag in the UI when going through the phone like pressing the back button for returning etc.  Samsung need to fix the bug for battery drain its drains like crazy. Disappointed with the battery.\\n\\n\",\n",

Sometimes it lags but that is acceptable.4.Internal memory- 128GB its satisfactory, what is even better that it has a dedicated slot for memory card and since  had onnem my previous device I was happy in it.Overall speaking it is a good range phone, especially it is MADE IN INDIA, of a South Korean company.\\n\\n\",\n",

Phone heats up quite quickly. Upgraded OS and right on day 1, it got heated up during the upgrade3. Poor quality camera - but can't expect more from a 18k mobile4. Large and bulky - poor design- again, can't expect more at that price5. Performance isn't greatOnly good things1. Display - good for that price and size2. It is Samsung!What am I comparing with? Oppo, Poco & Samsung A series.Have always been using Flagship mobiles and this one was just a secondary mobile for home, yet it is not quite exciting.\\n\\n\",\n",

Need to close all n open again to view from scratch.Buggy and  bulky model.Dislike same old UI icons. Bulky design like old mobiles. Camera is fantastic.

You cannot expect a DSLR clarity for this price even if you have a 128 pixel in Digital zoom.If you are willing to buy only for a high quality camera, not a good choice.

       " \"\\n\\n  Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .Pros :1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 17K .2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs . The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .Cons :1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I chose to purchase this because of two things : The display, having already used the M30. And, the humongous 6000mAH Battery.As for the battery, I have received something even better. The m31 display is an upgrade over the M30. I don't know if I am wrong, but it is more crisp and has better contrast.But however I am disappointed with the battery. Even though it is 1000 mAh higher capacity, I have not noticed any significant difference over M30.But this is again compensated by a far better camera than the M30. The M30 camera was pathetic to say the least.This is however not as good as a realme or redmi. But, the display is light years better than the realmes or mis.\\n\\n\",\n",

Product Quality:The sturdiness of smartphone is really good and the case provided in the box really helps the phone to be more safe.5.

       " \"\\n\\n  ProsAmazing display quality.Top notch clarity on Amazon Prime on par with OnePlus kind of phones.Camera quality is great in 64pixel mode back cam and 32 pixel mode front cam. Macro shot, food shot are good. Live bokeh on back cam is ok and front cam live bokeh will disappoint.Battery backup is definitely better than a 3000 to 4000 mAh with snapdragon SOC.General processing, speed and animations are seamless.if you are a fan of Samsung ui you would love it.Finger print sensor is good as the best ones , it's fast enough.ConsAudio quality with a Sony Bass headset is not so great, frequencies and noise cancellation is not soothing, cannot match a Nokia 6 Dolby, if you are music lover, this phone will disappoint you. Yet sound with a Bluetooth speaker was good. Surround effects on Dolby mode are good but audio quality needs some work.I am not a fan of custom ui and someone used to the stock android & miss it, still can manage with launchers like Nova to get the stock android feel.Has a lot of Samsung and third party apps which you have to disable. Some cannot be disabled as well. Of the 6GB, 1.5 GB is wasted on these apps. So you practically have only 3gb left after the OS and Samsung apps, which is not expected of 6gb ram device. A stock android phone will offer more RAM and processing power in reality, with the same hardware.Exynos is worthy for normal use and I am not sure about gaming as I have not tried.Extra memory and battery are in place because of the bloatware the phone ships in. These are not annoying like the ones on Micromax or cheaper phones. Most of these genuine ones, but one may not use them.Larger battery makes the phone heavier, plastic body gives a false feel like the phone is not sturdy, the phone actually is pretty solid, if you have a case and glass you don't find a difference.Over all a worthy smartphone and worth its money.\\n\\n\",\n",

Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy. We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.\\n\\n\",\n",

Plus side the battery life would last longer so.2. Camera quality is good. Though some reviews say not up to the mark - as the issue is there a separate option to use 4:3 64 MP which needs to be selected. Out of the box the default settings is 4:3 16 MP. This should help differentiate. This is in a way ok as 64 MP will use a lot of space for each picture as the size ratio is high.3. Display is the best as always.4.

       " '\\n\\n  The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a disappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.A little more details after a couple of months usage. This phone needs to be little more rugged as it can crack at edges and screen very easily. An aluminum/any metal body would be much better. The battery after 2hrs 20 mins charge can easily take you through the day with above moderate usage. For heavy users, still a fast charging option may be required at the end of day. I mean who keeps phone to charge for 2+ hours? You cannot risk charge it whole night too. Samsung has produced a nice phone. It could be a game changer with some more changes.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I am not sure what but I feel something is missing. The finger print sensor is not good. Sometimes it does not read finger print and we have to enter the pass code or pattern. Camera and battery is good. For medium usage it gives backup for almost two full days. With 2 hours of browsing Facebook and other websites, and about 2 hours of calls...using Bluetooth almost 7-8 hours a day. Battery still lasts for almost full 2 days.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don\\'t need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can\\'t use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and \"reduce animations\" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox securityDisplay: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experienceSound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that\\'s what Bluetooth speakers are for)Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that\\'s not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can\\'t sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Phone speed - goodCamera - Very GoodBattery - Huge but device consumption is perhaps highTouch - Smooth (Better than Xiaomi and Realme)Cons - Person on other side while on call complains of a bit low voice. (Remember to turn off wifi calling for better voice.

Perhaps revised rates after some time.Overall - Good mobile. Will give you better feel than Xiaomi or Realme.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The Box Contents :The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related PapersFirst Impressions :The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.After a week usuge:1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30sAs a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.\\n\\n\",\n",

Watching videos is a delightful experience2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast4. Apps load quickly as expecteB. Cons1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of \"fast charging\", which is very disappointing.Overall the phone is very good and highly recommended.\\n\\n',\n",

This phone may not come with features like punch hole display, in screen fingerprint sensor but after having used this I don't miss those features.

       " '\\n\\n  Update: 03Jun2020Visited Airtel store today and the customer care exec told me that all new phones autimatically switch to WiFi calling for better call quality.But I disagree.  Given the fact that WiFi calling is disabled in system settings, how can it be automatically switched to Wi-Fi calling?Still stuck. Samsung... Please help... Honour the phones system settings.-----First Review:The phone is very good in everyday usage.The only problem faced is that the phone automatically switches to WiFi calling while making or receiving a call despite turning off WiFi calling. The network is Airtel.This results in a situation where once the call starts, data gets switched off. No internet connectivity. So cannot talk and connect to internet simultaneously.Am writing this after a lot of googling to find a fix for this.The phone has April 1 2020 patch applied.Can Samsung or anyone out there help fix this problem?Also let me know if it is an Operator related issue (please mention what the operator needs to fix) so I can talk to the concerned.\\n\\n',\n",

Best thing is that i can move my apps from internal storage to sd card as most phones not allows this thing. It doesn't heat much even at games like Fortnite or pubg.

While sleeping keep it on maximum.These are the issues people are facing because they have not fully set their phones.Now,The camera is genuinely amazing. Night shot are extremely well colored and aren't dull.Processor - the exynos 9611Simply put it resembles 675AIE in performance than the 722 AIE. So, that's one factor you need to consider.What does it mean?It means playing  PubG in ultra graphics will be a problem. Just that, at the extreme frame rate the phone will not be able to do it.Note:only at extreme frame rate dies the phone sort of fails.For everything else the maximum RAM usage is 4.2 and then under device care ckean your RAM.

       " \"\\n\\n  Its been over 3 months now with this phone. Some highlights :1. super amoled screen- probably the best display in the 11 to 20 k rupees segment, hands down. Much needed if are like me and you read alot on kindle etc. Having used an amoled once, won't go opt for other screens ever!2. Free VPN with Samsung max, so better privacy3. Its Made in India, and the ultimate profits go to South Korea, where samsung is headquartered (not China).4. A pretty low Sar value. So a much safer phone than its competitors, especially Chinese brands, in terms of the amount of radiation u are exposed to.5. Battery life is not that great as they proclaim to be, but it's still good.6. The camera is pretty good in this price range, and the front camera also does its job pretty well. (Tip- you need to change snge the default resolution of the camera to 64 mp to utilize the full power of the lens. Many people don't do this, and then they write bad about the camera)7. A fast charger- thought not as fast as other high end phones, the charger is a good improvement from standard chargers in this price range.8. Much more reliable than Chinese brands, and rest assured, they won't steal your data and won't snoop on you.What it doesn't have - an IR blaster, But that's not a big deal.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I had high expectations on Samsung M31, but after  using  for about  one week I find it not very impressive. I'm writing  this honest  review as per my observations.Pros -1. Display is very good.Cons -1. Charging takes too long, from 30% to 100% charging, it took more than 2 hours.2. In regard to battery lasting, I don't  find much differencebetween my old realme 3 pro which has 4045 mah and this phone which is claimed to have 6000 mah battery. I have to charge everyday.3. Most irritating is while attending calls in our ears it automatically goes to onhold mode and also call recording  starts automatically while placing the phone in our ears though automatic setting is off. Samsung should really work with this issues and correct the software options during calls.4. Finger and eyes sensor is not so swift like my old realme 3 pro.5. Main Camera is also not very impressive upon comparing  my old phone but yes front camera  for Samsung M31 is better.I hope Samsung  will soon correct all these issues.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I got a 8Gb 128Gb variant. The phone is great value for money. I'm sure everyone's read the specs and are looking for more user experience insights, so here goes mine. I wanted to buy a phone which gets latest security patch updates at least for the next 2-3 years (else my office mail doesn't work). I also wanted one that was made in India and owned by an Indian entity. A phone meeting both requirements doesn't exist. So the next best option is a good phone (security  patch) made in India by an entity that does not have a Chinese owning entity. Options were Panasonic (Jap) and Samsung (Kor). I've used Samsung phones before so went for this which had the following pros:1. Made in India2. 6Gb/8GB RAM3. 64/128 Gb ROM4. Fast processor (handles heavy apps with ease)5. Smart finger print sensor with notification scroll feature6. Awesome battery backup7. Nice pics for this price8. Amazing display9. Great sound quality, enhances the music experience on external speakers too.10. Auto disable screen timeout when face detectedThere may be many more features I don't use.. but I'm a typical person mostly using for work and some web surfing. I don't play games so don't know.On cons (explaining why I gave 3 stars) is only one.. the first phone delivered started shutting down on its own after a day. I quickly raised a replacement request and I got a new one and that's working great but the hassle of having to do all that is not nice.  I also read that this issue is there a lot. So Samsung needs to take note and fix this.Otherwise awesome phone guys 15-20k range, this is by far the best phone. And it's made in India!! :) go for it guys!\\n\\n\",\n",

Good Camera..Long battery Charge.Incoming SMS blocking is one of the important provisions in any smart  phone.But in M31, this is partially missing.SMS coming with a phone number only can be blocked. SMS coming without a phone number and coming with names of the business group can not be blocked. This is a great shortfall.Informed to the Help center through WhatsApp chat.

So may be its defect in the make.Camera quality was pretty average. Pictures in day light were decent. Under low light the quality is horrible.Battery life of the 1st model I received was good. Charged pretty fast too.

       " \"\\n\\n  Sometimes finger sensor doesn't work like A series.. means if ur finger r little wet it doesn't work properly . But I love this mobile , after many search I choose it and it is best as per my choice. Camera is good for orginal photography, samsung always captures the original picture not like realme or MI type extra brightness.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Camera is good, call quality is good but the other person's voice can be heard outside even though the volume is low, when you are on call, which is a flaw in samsung phones.Speaker quality when you are speaking from a distance, in WhatsApp video calls is not good. I tried this with MI and they are much better.The major drawback is the claim made by Samsung about fast charging. Only 35-40% gets charged in one hour. So it takes almost 3 hours for full charge. I had Motorola G5 Plus which charged 60-65% in one hour, which means full charge in 1.5 hours.\\n\\n\",\n",

I chatted for 3 hours and it sucks 5%battery only. Thats damm cool.●UI is very smooth and handy.●Screen quality is just awsome.●No heating issue in normal Usage. I have tried 13 apps running in background.(no gaming apps)●Fingerprint reader is fast but face detection is not so fast though its good.Cons:●Cam quality is not up to the mark. It has 64MP, still edge detection is not that perfect. My earlier mobile was Nokia 6.1Plus which has 16MP cam, still I find that better. Hope a soft update can fix this.●I prefer stock android, ANDROID ONE...anyway This UI is also good.● Mobile heats while gamming. This is not a gamming phone. Though I didn't play PUBG or Freefire or CALLofDUTY. Still it heats.. so no question of playing those games.●Charging time is too long and it don't support fast charging. 15w charger in the box and it takes nearly 2 to 3 hrs to charge this phone 0 to 100... I even tried it with Dash Charger(1plus).. still the result is same.. it has long battery so I will not complain about this as I charge it at night.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I was one of those guys who ordered this 6/128 gb phone on day one. One of the bad phones Samsung ever made. Even after few software updates, it still restarts on its own, mostly while into a browser and sometimes in other apps. Sometimes, instead of restarting, it turns into a SAMSUNG brick, ie phone will not boot and only Samsung logo keeps on displaying for long. In this condition, you can not restart the phone with power button, you have to use RESET method.  Fortunately, in this case, it only restarts and doesn't get hard reset. Battery lasts for only 4 hours of video, otherwise it's pretty good and lasts for 14-16 hours easily with normal use. Voice from earpiece had started getting deteriorate and I found that the earpiece mesh collects lot of dirt because it sits in a groove, thus vitiating voice quality. It's not waterproof (not claimed too) so if you splash water onto it expect touch to not respond and speaker volume to be extremely low for an hour or two. Though it worked perfectly after three hours of drying after I dropped it once in the water and it got submerged fully for a second or two. Samsung Swipe keyboard is little weird, many times typing wrong words. I can't say more about camera as I don't use it much. Single speaker is not bad for listening music. Fingerprint scanner is not so good, most of the time doesn't recognize. Face recognition is better than that. Still, except for the bricking part, it's a good phone for its look, screen/ resolution and hardware for this price.\\n\\n\",\n",

The phone sometimes restarts suddenly when we are still using it. And I really dont get any clue why this happens. No warnings, no reasons displayed. It just restarts suddenly..It has happens approx 6-7times during the last month.Overall it's good. But there features which are different from what I expected.The charger is not that slow. It's good enough.The battery doesn't last that long as I expected. Its above average.The position is of earphone jack is at the bottom, which is not convenient for me personally. Especially during video calls, it better to have at the top.The RAM is 6GB but 2-3gb is pre occupied. So I suggest only go for 6GB RAM.The loud speaker could be better in terms of quality as well as intensity of loudness.Overall it's a very good phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I'm reviewing this phone after using it for nearly two months. I bought this phone as a temporary replacement to my flagship. I'm actually very impressed by the price to perfomance ratio of this device. The biggest USP of this phone is its OS. Samsung's OneUI 2.0 has improved tremendously in reducing bloatware and managing RAM efficiently.  It multitasks with ease. The battery life is fantastic. I'm putting my device to charge every alternate day, the screen on time is at least 9-11 hours depending on the intensity of the usage. The Camera quality is great, not outstanding. The speaker is loud and clear. It has Dolby Atmos audio drivers for external audio devices. The call clarity is excellent from both ends. The rear camera does a great job but the front camera doesn't live up to the expectations. It smoothens the images taken from the front cam, not sure if it's because of the sensor or if its in the software. Since it's a budget phone I don't think it would be fair to expect a lot.  I'm not much of a mobile gamer so I never actually tested it in that aspect. The overall build quality is good, looks premium but the entire body is made of plastic. It nearly takes 150 mins to charge to a 100% with the 15W factory charger. The speed doesn't change even if you use a charger of higher capacity. Coming to the conclusion,  I feel this is the best budget phone considering the price and brand value of Samsung. It does its job perfectly and I'll definitely recommend this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.As per suggestion I updated phone immediatelyThe look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.Once this phone restarted on its own.Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.After 3 months, I experience the hanging once every week.Gets heat up a lot on video calls of WhatsApp, Zoom and Duo calls and restarts automatically.So overall, not recommended.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is my 4th Samsung mobile device having used different models over the years starting from Wave series.M31 is a definite buy if you are a heavy mobile user where battery, call quality and connectivity is priority.+ Battery has lasted me for more than a complete work day with approx 4hrs of talktime over 50 audio calls over mobile network, 5hrs mix of Microsoft audio call, Google meet audio call, atleast 30-40mins of what's app chatting throughout the day and almost an hr of social media including audio & videos with GPS always ON.Charging is pretty fast.Battery: 10/10+ speed of device which has been brilliant in multi tasking and switching between appsPerformance: 8/10+ support for airtel wifi callingConnectivity: 9/10Camera was never a priority for me however is pretty decent.Camera: 8/10What I didn't like is the bloatware that gets installed from Samsung Galaxy store.

       " '\\n\\n  Premium phone for a great price.The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display with 2340x1080 pixel resolution. The display is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top.Samsung Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 operating system topped with the company’s own layer of One UI 2.0. The user interface is quite clean and the large app icons give a nice look to the device. There is also an app drawer where users can hide all the apps and can keep the home screen clutter-free. Like other Samsung smartphones, this one also comes preloaded with all the usual Samsung apps along with some third-party apps such as Facebook, Amazon, Snapchat, and others. Samsung has not included Bixby in the Galaxy M31 and along with this the Bixby Vision app is also missing from the device. The device also comes with Digital Wellbeing and Parental Control options which array of usual gestures. For instance, users can double-tap to wake the device and users also have an option to hide the three-button navigation layout and use full-screen gestures to control the smartphone.The camera is one of the major updates which comes with the Galaxy M31. The Galaxy M30s has a triple rear camera, while the Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup. The rear camera of the device comprises 64MP main sensor, 5MP macro camera, 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. On the front, you will find a 32MP selfie camera. The company claims that both the cameras are capable of recording 4K video. Samsung has also added Night Mode in the camera for better photography experience. Like always the Samsung camera app is pretty clean and easy to use and users can find different modes to shoot within the app. Along with this, the app also offers a toggle that allows users to switch between the primary and wide-angle lens cameras. There is also a Scene Optimiser present in the app, which quickly detects the scene and set up the camera accordingly. We were quite satisfied with the camera results of Samsung Galaxy M31. The device was quick to focus and also offered an ample amount of detailing in the images captured. Swinging on the wide-angle lens camera offers a wider field of view along with some really good images. However, we personally loved the macro camera which offered really detailed images. The images captured in daylight were better as compared to the ones taken indoors. The Night Mode incorporated in the device also does a reasonably good job and it reduces noise from the images taken during the night. The 32MP selfie camera does a satisfactory job as both the selfies taken indoor and outdoor turned out to be good.6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. Unlike other smartphone makers, Samsung has included a fast charger within the box. We were able to get through the day of mixed usage with a single charge, courtesy the powerful battery Samsung has packed in.The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you. The smartphone comes under the budget segment but it doesn’t look like one.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This was bought for my father. He was v skeptic buying this. We got this for 20,500 on emi. The phone reached in proper condition. The phone comes only with a charger & a pin to open the sim slot. What surprised me is that, no screenguard is already on it and we have to purchase one seperately. I already bought a flip cover for the phone which is doesn't actually do the guarding of screen for minor scratches. Samsung should pre apply a screenguard to smartphones, 20,500 phone and is not a small amount too. We checked the phone everything was good. The camera quality is sub-par. I am not impressed with the can quality. The music is playing well. All ok. Nothing wow about this phone.. just glad it will serve the purpose for my father.

It took additional 9 days for the replacement to reach me that too after multiple conversations and \"so called\" inspection and all. After all this when I got the phone which was fortunately in working condition, I\\'m not at all happy with the output1- finger recognition is not very good, you have to tap hard.2- Face direction doesn\\'t work on multiple accounts.3- phone takes forever for charging. How can they not provide fast charging in the phone of today\\'s generation?4- phone is extremely slippery. Impossible to use without cover.5- speaker volume is pathetic.6- camera quality is okay okay.7- picture quality is pretty good.I will not at all recommend this phone. I\\'m sure samsung was able to sell huge number of handsets but they are only trying to ride on anti-china notion going on currently. Since there are very less option if you do not want to buy Chinese phone, many would buy m31. However, this phone more look like \"something built in hurry in an effort to deliver at comparatively lower price but without much R&D\". Dear Samsung, I was not expecting this from you. We deserve better, you owe us better.\\n\\n',\n",

The battery lasts 1o hours with continuous hotspot ussage OR One and half day with normal internet and mobile usage.2.  Supplied 15W charger takes approx 2.30 to 3 hour to fully charge the phone.3. Camera Video artificial light performance is not good and get worse if slow motion mode is used.\\n\\n',\n",

Main is speaking clarity over call which is supab. Battery life goes upto 2 days even after using it as hotspot device for my smart TV for more than 6 hrs. primary 32 mp camera takes gr8 pics. I won't say rear camera is not good. It is also gr8. But u can't use flash in 64 mp setting.  Fingerprint sensor and face unlock do its job well. Fast charge takes 2 and half hr to full charge from 10%. But I prefer more slow charger as that will increase battery life. And remember it has non removable battery. So why to worry if it takes 4 hrs to full charge. Overall go for it without thinking for alternate.But one problem, seller didn't supply ejection pin with the mobile. I don't want to return as mobile is superb. But seller must check such mistakes before delivery. For someone he may forget to send charger or even mobile. I would expect that delar to send the ejection pin seperately as I won't get it from market.\\n\\n\",\n",

Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.Performance -Over all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.Overall summary -In this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on. It's made in India mobile so you can definitely use this mobile without any hassle so go to amazon Amazon Samsung website, buy your mobile, start using it and enjoy!\\n\\n\",\n",

I recommend this phone and in this segment ..... samsung has just got everything boosted. The ram us also good..... I have not played very heavy games on it except once I played a 3.5gb role playing game and it was still working fluid. Front camera is also very good and captures really clear pics. Macro camera is also nice. I charge this phone once and use for almost one and a half day without trouble. It's a bit heavy than recent smartphone but it's because its battery is jumbo but the weight is evenly distributed and once in use..... you will never find it a problem. The Dolby sound AI works really great and is only applicable when using earphones or headset. The inbuilt speaker is also loud and clear.

       " \"\\n\\n  Not the best phone on the market. can never come close to their flagship phones. So many features are not there. Its like it's made to feel midrange. The camera is horrible. Just take my word for it. When I bought this phone, I read these reviews, and I was like wow these people probably don't know what they're talking about, but yeah it was a late realisation. And of you're a serious photographer, then forgot about this phone. The camera has no pro mode features. It doesn't have manual focus, or shutter speed . Night mode is so gross you're never going to want to use it. The battery was supposed to be amazing, its not. Its just good. Like a 4500 mah battery. If you're looking for a great UI, then I'll have to get your hopes down again. This is not one UI, it on UI core. Which is basically one UI stripped of all it's cool features. Some great alternatives are : Samsung m31s (if you really want Samsung) realme 6, redmi not 9, Poco x2, and Motorola one fusion. You can trust me here I have a lot of smartphone experience...\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Among the range of below 20K, this is the Smartphone, everyone should blindly go with buying without any second thought.It has the needed Elegant look, amazing screen display, camera, battery, Classy feel, etc. JUST GO FOR IT!! This phone has everything that I expected. Battery lasts for 2 days with normal use, listening to music for couple of hours a day including watching a whole movie on prime.Check the detailing of the camera took in the dark in the pic uploadedI have also recommended to my friends and families, and post me I have made them buy too :)\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  After 1 month usage, here is my review.I had been using Moto for years now but got fed up with not up to date build quality and poor performance. I am also not comfortable with UI that is far from stock android, so didnt give the chinese phones a look. So M31 was my best option.Samsung One UI with Android 10 is an absolute pleasure to navigate.6GB RAM is more than enough with 3.5 GB always available without any apps open.It multi tasks with ease.Screen is AMOLED Full HD and it completely blew your mind as a first time AMOLED user. The difference between AMOLED and normal screen is astounding. Once you get used to it, you won't be able to go back to normal screen. Best Display on a budget phone hands down.I was discouraged by other reviews saying Exynos processor is not good. However I have had no problems with it. Ofcourse if you compare its benchmarks with Snapdragon, it falls behind but that does not make it a bad processor. But trust me, looking at it alone, it is good with no problems. I haven't encountered any stutter or lag till now. Even gaming like Call of Duty and PUBG is perfect with medium settings. Ultra high drops some frames but that is expected of a budget phone. And anyway, gaming experience is perfectly fine on medium settings.Haven't yet tested camera with the lockdown going on but for normal user like me, I found it to be of good quality.Battery is a behemoth and easily lasts 1.5 days with normal usage. with 1-2 hours gaming, I need to charge it only once every morning.Because of battery its slightly on the heavy side but you wont notice because weight distribution is excellent. Feels extremely nice to hold. I strongly recommend getting a cover as the back is glossy and picks up a ton of smudges. That's the only con I experienced.Having used Moto G series and Moto X series in the past, I can safely say this is the best budget smartphone I have brought till date. Phones with specs like this used to cost 30-40k 2 years back. Absolute steal.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  For the price this phone has really surprised me in the camera department! The shots come out really good n detailed..the only big disappointment is the processor..even with 6gb ram the phone still feels sluggish like a 3gb ram phone...lags time to time..typing slows down..if you are a really fast typer you might notice it..battery charging speed is decent it fits the price range..display is beautiful..another big plus point..vivid mode on the warmer side gives out nice vibrant colours..speaker is average..I'd suggest you put in a few extra bucks n go for the 8gb variant as more ram will help run the apps smoother and may cause less lag.4/5* for this!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Simple and straight:Pros:- Battery- Display clarity, bcz it\\'s Amoled and also the size- Enough speed according to it\\'s configuration. Mine is of 6gb RAM- UI, i used Mi before and thought it was the best UI till i started using this. This ONE UI is too good but will let you know about Flaws in \"Cons\"- This one for Amazon, i purchased it with exchange of my MI mobile bcz of the recent revolution, u know. The exchange value was very good, thanks to Amazon.Cons:- Fingerprint scanner sometimes is non-responsive, have to use power button to awake screen- There is no multi tasking windows available in this UI- Media volume is not loud enough, Bass lovers can\\'t have enough loudness when playing music- No IR blaster, which is very useful, Samsung should provide atleast in future- No LED indicator for notificationThese are what i observed and mentioned as per my experience, may be useful especially for anyone going purchase or Samsung and for Amazon. Basing on these, you can consider your priority. Cons aren\\'t that big and few can be changed or updated. Finally I recommend for buy. It is a Good Mobile.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.Thanks!\\n\\n\",\n",

I use my phone with wifi and data on with multiple apps running together. Even after 8hrs of use it consumes only  50 to 60 percent of the charge.Camera quality is also good.captures fine details well. The live focus is also quite good. For regular use and daily photography it is beyond sufficient.  I had seen few poor reviews about the camera, but it turned out good.The finger print reader is quick and responsive.Overall good value for money! With a sturdy back cover and a tempered glass it Is good to go.\\n\\n',\n",

Those gyz who says in you tube that it works 1 and half day or two days ..that does not perfectly match with the reality.One more think charging time is very high u need 3 hrs to recharge it from zero to 100%. I don't have problem with the charging time but those who have problem with the charging time they may shift to a better option.\\n\\n\",\n",

It was just good.Coming from an iPhone, I felt android phones' are way behind in Image processing techniques. Realized that pixel MP values are just to lure people and the real power of a camera lies in the Image processing.Rest everything is normal like every other phone.If you want to buy a Samsung 4GB RAM phone and macro photography doesn't matter for you, go for the M21. But If you are going for a 6GB phone, I would recommend you to spend those extra Rupees and get this M31.\\n\\n\",\n",

Amazon is refusing to replace as the 7 days replacement period is over.I took it to a service center and after few days I received a call from service center that please come and collect your coupon and return all the original box contents to us. I thought they will replace my phone but I was given a SERVICE REFUND COUPON of ₹17499 which can be redeemed only at a Samsung Store (Not Online). But they catch is no samsung store has samsung m31 or m31s. I don't like the A series phones. Don't know what will I do with this useless coupon. I have no other choice other than buying overpriced A series phones and S series phones\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to high storage capacity, security functions and the quality of the camera.

Great job from Amazon.Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel.

       " \"\\n\\n  Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.\\n\\n\",\n",

It recognizes and the finger opens the lock very fast.>there is also face scaneer which opens the phone preety fast.>no one can access the phone with out the access of phone passwords.Specs of the camera are the following👇>64 mp rear cam is very good compared relatively to the phones at this price.the pics just awesome you can enjoy them.>the 8 mp ultra wide camera is very good.>the clarity of 5 mp macro camera is very good compared to top end phones.>32 mp front face is so clear that your friends would be jealous of you during the video calls.talking about the display:->the screen is 6.4-inch(16.21 centimeters) Super Amoled - Infinity U Cut Display.>it supports colours over 16 millon.Gaming specs:->while playing the games like pubg ,COD and fortnite it is not the best .>The battery is so good that u could play upto 20 long pubg games in the phone.>You can download fortnite in this this by the help of samsung galaxy store.so it stil good for fortnite users.In this budget this is the best phone over all the phones.\\n\\n\",\n",

It could've been best phone if comes with Snapdragon medium range processor.I will update the review if I explore something new.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Pros--1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT  CAMERA  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.3. 6000mah BATTERY  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.Cons--1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX  SECURITY  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.3. BUILD QUALITY  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.4. 15 WATT CHARGER  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.Note-1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.Pros:1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.Cons:1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  M31 is one of the best mid tier, made in India, \"budget smartphone\" out there right now for people looking for an upgrade from their entry level smartphones. The super AMOLED display, 6000mAh battery, 128 GB storage and a Samsung Exynos processor, that\\'s a little better from the top of the line 600 series Qualcomm Snapdragon line of processors are the strongest selling points. The UI occupies a lot of RAM, 1.8 GB on an average, and the battery performance isn\\'t mind-blowing, it\\'s great 1&1/2 days of usage easily (playing some games, watching YouTube for 3-5 hours), which you\\'d expect from a 6000mAh battery (I expected a little more). The camera is great, macro shots are well lit and crisp, 64MP main sensor senses colour pretty well, and the wide angle isn\\'t all that great, but it gets the job done, hyperlapse, slomo features are a great addition. Front facing camera is \"okayish\". The phone feels heafty and sturdy to the touch, and feels responsive overall, transitions to background apps are a bit jittery, but I believe it\\'s a UI issue, and not a performance issue. PUBG runs well, if you plan to play casually. Overall, I\\'ve been using this phone for over a month now, and I have no major complain. Totally recommend it.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Before zeroing in on the Samsung Galaxy M31, I researched the smartphone market in India and tabulated the data in terms of specs. For those looking to not give their money to the Chinese who are using the money to attack our country, among the Non-Chinese smartphones, the M31 presented the most bang-for-buck on paper.The M31 really good in every department, including in its massive 6k mAh battety, its AMOLED display, Android 10 OS, 6GB of RAM, 128GB ROM, Samsung's slick UI.At the sub 20K price range, the phone is an excellent buy.For photographers though not so much since it does not fully support CAM2API. Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k. The 6z supports shooting in RAW as well, unlike the Samsung M31.For the regular Joe though, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a pocket friendly Non-Chinese phone option that is compelling.Amazon's delivered 1 day ahead of schedule.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.9. Headphone is not given with phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

You can buy one outside per your choice.Suggestions:Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.Never look at M30 or M30s.

This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this,  I've been using A popular known brand and model,  Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming.  And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Best thing about this Mobile is the BIG Battery & of course the Display is Top Notch.~ For Gaming also mobile fine, some say exynos is not that good vs Snapdragon chipsets but after using for 1st time i would say, not at all disappointed, because see if u can play Pubg in High settings and there not much heat then what else do you need, though there seems to be some lagging issue in higher settings for PUBG Graphics but basic & ultra settings works perfectly 👌.~ No issues with Sims (Airtel/ Jio)~ Best Display i have ever used (AMOLED)~ Sound quality also very good with speaker & also with earphones, atleast way better than my previous mobile (Moto X 4)~6000 Mah BATTERY ❤️ can't beat that with this price seriously 💯 easily works for whole day, on normal use u may get 30% on next day too,My location, Bluetooth, is always on for fitness band so with all these + fb, YouTube, insta , regular browsing, WhatsApp, pubg for 2-3 hours, i still get 25 - 35% at the night or next day morning, this is the best thing about this Mobile (Full Paisa wasoool hai 💯)~ 6gb Ram is quite good- nowadays u need atleast 6gb for smooth working, i haven't seen any hanging issues till now even after rough use believe me~ ONE UI 2.0 : I normally prefer clean stock android phones like Motorola, all my previous phones were from Motorola but u know it sucks now so wanted buy mid range with near clean stock android phone, so this my 1st Samsung Mobile, earlier i never liked Samsung because of there UI, but with ONEUI all is fine u get android 10 with all the Google features.~ Performance is also goodOverall i would definitely recommend this Mobile at this price range (i got this for 15,999)\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Believe me guys this is the best overall package u can get under 18k i have just brought a 64gb variant from amazon at 16k and trust me guys it exceeded my expectationsFirstly lets talk about the cons or negative points of the phone1. The polycarbonate back is a fingerprint magnet and is quite slippery applying a cover is  Highly reccomended2. The glass on the front is highly fragile and gets easily cracked. So applying a tampered glass is necessary.3. The front camera performs very poor in low light4. The fast charging is enabled by default but the battery backup is around 9hrs but if i disable fast charging i could get around 12 hrs of screen on time again that is a good thing because u can just charge it at night as it takes around 4 and half hours to charge completelyNow lets talk about pros:1. Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is  way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devicesIn the competition3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.If u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I'm using my Samsung Galaxy M31 for more than a month and now reviewing it.Below are the details that I feel and have have experienced during my usage.- sAmoled display: The best display one can get in the price range. It truely give flagship phone like experience in mid price range phone.- Bettery: Single charge works for me for more than 1.5 day almost with 3-4 hours daily calls, 2-3 hours daily live streaming, 24 hours net connected. It gets 15W fast charge which takes almost 3 hours to charge this power house from less than 10% to full charge.- Camera: quad camera setup does it job well. 64MP Primary camera takes decent photos in day light. Live focus also works great. Macro is fine too. Ultra wide mode is also good. Though it has night mode but shows noise. 32 MP front camera is best in this segment.Processor: Exynox 9611 works absolutely fine for day to day life. I'm not a gamer so not sure about gaming performance. Apps open without any issue and don't feel any lag.UI: One UI also gives the best experience. It is very smooth and easy to use.The other good thing about this phone is that Samsung is providing McAfee security in this phone which no one will find in Chinese phones.So if you have the budget of 17-18k for new smart phone and want to get smooth and best experience in this price range, please go ahead and buy this phone. But if you less budget around 14k the go for Galaxy M21 in which one will get tri camera setup instead of quad in M31 and have 64GB internal memory which should also be sufficient and rest of the features list are same as M31.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Been 2 months using this phone. Overall performance is good. Went ahead and chose this product because didn't wanted to go for Chinese brands.Less rating because only after 2 month of use suddenly touch pad stopped working. Wend ahead forced power off/on it worked. But only to become unresponsive next morning. Immediately rushed to samsumg cerive center in Malleshwaram Bangalore. They checked and replaced entire touch and screen panel free of cost as it was under warranty.This might be one of rare case but it happened with my device only.All other features 5 star camera, battery and user experience.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Everything is better than expected. Just one thing can't resolve: JioCall app doesn't work. Though jio internet works, calls also are ok. Only app itself is not ok. I tried to check sim setting, mobile data settings, to restart the phone, everything - but nothing helps. Maybe there's no need of this app actually as soon as everything works without so it's ok.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Really great phone at a great price. I have been using since two months..runs smoothly without any lag. The best thing is the display. Amazing amoled display with true black which dramatically enhances the user experience and the infinite display is a plus.The camera is quite good. amazing picture quality with a good resolution. Front camera is quite good and convenient for video calls. 64 mp camera, along with wide angled camera are some cool featuresBut it becomes little bad when you zoom.. like water coloring... image processing can be improved. But is acceptable at this price. Dont expect picture quality like that of an iphone or a 30000 plus phone.Battery is good enough for me. As i use it only for calls and browsing and normal regular use like watching movies, YouTube...it gives a decent battery support and lasts upto 1 and  a half day. Not suitable for gaming purpose. Doesn't feel like 6000 mAh. Might be because of the Amoled display as each pixel actively consumes power. Although, black screen uses no power as compared to LCD, still Amoled consumes more power than an average LCD or LED display. Again, battery performance acceptable at this price when compared to the other cool features at this price.Fingerprint sensor works smoothly.And at last, amazing looks and i really like the ocean blue color and the sides are gradually blackened! Stunning looks.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing this with my experience of 10 days usage.Battery::I have used many models. Battery wise this is the best mobile I ever used. I use my mobile heavily (personal use, office use, video streaming, net browsing, gaming). For me it is giving 1 full day.Finger Print Scanner::Working accurately but little slow compare to Lenovo and honor mobiles.Camera::Camera is good but not up to the mark. Infact I have a disappointment on this section. Taking too much time to sharpen the picture. Difficult to take children photos. But overall is OKAY... It's camera is good in daylight but in low light conditions picture quality not good.Performance::I give you 5/5 in this section. All previous apps are being saved in memory while your phone put in rest aside. Fast and memory recollection is awesome.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  One of the best mobiles I have purchased.Pros: Amazing battery life as it has 6000 mAH battery.Awesome camera. Set it to highest quality if you dont mind space occupied 🙂.Capacity is 64GB which is pretty good.  However you have the option of having a 512 GB microsd Card. I intend to have 128GB card installed so that I can use it as an external drive of sorts 😀. Call quality is good and so is the internet speed handling. All in all very good mobile and I am quite happy using it.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Nice display and battery backup. Don't expect perfomance. Good for candy crush level games. Processor is old. At this price today's competition you'll get better ones. Let's be honest. Camera is pathetic. No difference between 16 and 64 MP . I am not a 'mobile gamer' since this device can't do much in there. Also lots of bloatware by samsung. Unnecessary waste updates and apps. Only good things is the battery backup and display. Sound not so great. I don't know why they put a Dolby feature. No change in sound in headphones. Its a Dummy . Speaker an average performer.. Fanboys can suck it. No need to spend this much money for the crappy perfomance. I bought it for 17499 for 6 GB 128 GB variety. Body is cheap plastic. One of the worst kind .Glass breaks easily\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Consider Other choices also.Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.No notification LED.Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  A big NO for gamers but simply awesome things are -1. of course the AMOLED Display.2. 6000mAh battery3. Main 64MP Samsung sensor with good image quality.4. wifi calling feature.5. dedicated SD Card slotBut some other facts to consider -1. in Pro mode camera 'shutter speed control' and 'focus control' is missing.2. Volume Rocker and power button are cheap plastic, although it gives good tactile feedback.3. have to very careful through the setup process, otherwise, you will get lots of unwanted notifications.4. you need a good protective cover to prevent scratches.5. Charger cable/Data cable, provided is short.6. u will feel Battery is taking so much juice to compare to snapdragon SoC, because of Exynos 9611 processor. but u 'll get 1.5-2 days of battery for normal usage.... I hope this will help u to decide before buying this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Its been like more then 2 weeks since i am usig this phone with my primary sim.I have been testing all the features and usability this phone offers till this time and now i feel i can give my thoughts about this device.So lets make pointers:-Built: I feel the phone has amazing built Quality. Whereas Yes, the Plastic back won't feel much premium but it is actually much more practical then glass back phones. Yes it can scratch easily but who uses a phone without a cover as i would suggest to get a premium cover to get that premium feeling.Talking about Glass back phones it would be very costly to replace but the plastic shell of m31 would be much more cheaper.-Display: As you already knew its best under 20k segment. Better then other Amoled screen and No Crazy 120hz refresh rate but yeah it feels much better to use.-Software: I was using a stock android device previously and the experience of oneui is actually not bad its smooth and even fun to use. There are some hiccups here and there which is acceptable but one thing is that recent app menu lags alot while switching between apps ruining all the experience.It can be fixed via some software updates.Hardware: Phone is not heavy. The buttons are placed right, good quality buttons gives premium and positive feedback. Fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate too.-Camera: The camera quality is actually very good. All the cameras are quite usefull if you know how to use them. The Wide angle and macro camera is also good but implementation is not that great a software update can fix that too.For the night i can say that the shots are blur and grainy if you can use the camera properly then you can take some amazing shots like i do so for me the night camera is also good not great. Whereas some updates can do improvements to it.-Battery: Best battery life of any phone i have used till now. Yes the charging speed could have been better but the battery life is soo good that you will hardly rush for a charge.Note* first charge heats the device bad but after 2-3 days of usage it gets back to normal nothing to worry about. My device doesn't heatup now.My usage includes all day 2active sims, 50% brightness all day, wifi/data ON 24/7. 2hrs Gaming,1hr youtube,  Some calls, and all day social media.With a usage like this, my phone starting from 100% in the morning to 2nd day evening dropping to 25-30%. I never let my device go below that. Even the stand-by time of the phone is great.-Performance: Its fast and fluid. Whereas the ram management could be Better which can be fixed. No heating issue. Good for normal to heavy gaming. Overall the performance is Very Good of the device.This device is not specified for a single use. Its practically a straight forward device which allows the user to use it as a phone should be used. The phone doesn't offer any hanky panky Stuff for attention making anyone mad for games nor for tiktok.Verdict: If you are a rough user or you travel alot, if you are not a mad gamer then you can go for this device.It offers best practicality and usability thats how a phone should be.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  After using 1week I am writing this.First, I would like to thanks Amazon for their service, I got the phone before estimated deliver date.Design of the phone is good.Battery is just awesome. With a moderate use it is giving fully two days service.Camera is also awesome in this price range in both day and night mode. But it can't say as 64MP.There is no heating and lagging problem till now.Charging is very fast. But one thing I found as cons, it's network capturing quality is little worse as compared to Vivo mobile phones.  Otherwise it is a quality product. I would like to suggest everybody to go with this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

The battery which is 6000 mah even with a heavy phone usage will easily last you through the day and even more.4. The finger print reader works well.5.

I am a dedicated & loyal iPhone user since beginning but I can confidently say that it was definitely a very good buy. Excellent features, no way behind Apple, great look, back side finger sensor is of great help to easy opening of screen lock. I took some photos , same frames both with my iPhone 11 & Samsung M31. I can definitely say Samsung captured much better snaps in terms of depth, vividness, colour & clarity. Last but not the least , value for money. I must highly recommend.\\n\\n',\n",

Both rear  and front camera is awesome  and quality of picture is good..it suport 4K videos..I am bit disappointed  on battery quality and charging ponit..It is not up to the mark on 6000mAh battery..It takes 3-4 hr to charge the full battery  and discharge within a day.If you will play game,it will discharge withi  10 hr.I am not playing games much,so I am satified but I won't support to buy this phone if you paly games all most of the time in a day.Also I am not happpy  on face recognition..I feel as It doesn't  support sometime..But overall it is a good phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Im writing this review after using it 20 days. I have received my phone on 8th March ,ordered on 5th march when the sell has started.when I took this in my hand ,feel very light weight if comparision to 6000mah mega battery, I watched a movie of 2hour and 5 mins and it consumed only 20% battery ,battery life is very great ,it runs approx 1 to 1and half day after full charge. Charging time is approx 140 minutes.Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up. Worth for money...\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smoothBattery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expectScreen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decentCamera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp camProcessor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.\\n\\n\",\n",

Camera is also superb with super video UHD recording. By default it comes with 32 Mpixel but user can change to 64Mpixel and click awesome pictures.

Sometimes while I use the camera or watching a video and sometimes while I play the game into it, its screen gets completely black.

I used Samsung J7 prime for 2 and half years. So i know what is the problem with exynos processor. So there exynos 9611 also good processor for approx 2 years. But then this is behave just a 7k-8k budget device. If there was a Snapdragon 712 or 720G processor, it would definitely be rocking device from SAMSUNG under 20k budget. Okay  but the current performance is really smooth and cool. So 4/5.Fingerprint scanner good but also have face unlock option so no problem for device lock security. Both work fine. 4/5.Battery gives approx a day with medium usage. 4/5But charging time really slow. 6000 mAh battery takes time to getting full charge around 2.5 hours. 3/5. Ok let's talk. I think i covered all the pros and cons. Then you decide that what should you do, buy or not buy. If you ask me then definitely go for it if you watch movie and video with decent gaming. I don't think of any other mobile for watching movies or videos. The screen just AWESOME. That's all.\\n\\n\",\n",

It keeps hanging frequently. While operating any application on phone, it stops responding along with this is issue the speaker quality has become very low (basically it does not functions) No Sound at all. Even while playing random videos on YouTube application as well in the phone's gallery it automatically gets fast forwarded without giving any command.Its altogether a very disappointing experience not only with the Samsung Phone Brand but also with Amazon Prime Membership Account and the online Retailer (STPL Exclusive Online) listed on Amazon.I would request to please get the Product replaced Asap, as Due to lock-down I am unable to even take it to Samsung Service Center or to any Mobile Repairing Shop.Note: Kindly Respond to the above complaint, or legal action will be taken further at your Cost.\\n\\n\",\n",

Overall Handling is quite satisfying. With an Amoled Screen and a good resolution perfect for binge watching. You can switch between Vivid and Natural colours though (don't know why it comes in vivid default).2. Has a 64 MP rear camera with ultra wide and depth however as anyone would have a nick for wanting the best, there still is room for improvement.3. Comes with Face recognition and Finger print scanner, however there is a fraction of a second's lag while unlocking the phone. Recognition does get better with more use.4. Has an inbuilt Optimiser in the UI with anti-theft features to clear up memory,check battery usage and scan through an inbuilt antivirus. So that is an addition, however a third party antivirus should still be used as back up.5. The smartphone boasts of a 6000mAH mega battery and it lives up to the figure with 9-10 hrs of battery if used continuously and upto 2 days with normal to minimal use(Frankly speaking I gifted the phone to my mother and was surprised to see it working at 28%, the day after it was charged..also it was charged in the evening around 5 pm...so still not 2 days). The Charger supports fast charging but I wouldn't compare it to One Plus' dash charging as it would take upto 150 mins to reach full charge on M31.Eventually I did want to buy one more for myself,but there already is one M31 in the family.A great buy.\\n\\n\",\n",

In fact, Samsung told us at the Galaxy M31 launch that the camera, battery life, and display are the most important factors for young people nowadays, and those are the parameters it focused on when designing the Galaxy M31.The Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that’s pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there’s a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn’t feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone’s liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.At the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ’64 megapixels’ mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There’s also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phonesThe ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s’ ultra-wide camera. It’s useful to capture a wider scene, but don’t expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it’s great if you love taking close-up shots, though it’s often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.Here are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Iam always been big fan of samsung display and camera and ever since I had used them I haven\\'t thought ant going 4 other chinese brands with cheap LCD display on which u can neither appreciate a good pic nor game or enjoy movies on it!!6.4\" Full hd Amoled screen + 64 mp/32 mp camera + 6000 mah battery wd fast charging was too much to ignore even when MI & realme were giving very competent specs at lower price but it\\'s lcd display & camera was not 4 me hence I went for M31  and it outperformed my expectations!!From phone display to camera quality to battery life to processor it was just perfect for me in 15K..I wud hv appreciated a gradient glossy panel but ocean blue color is actually very beautiful and shiny and phone doesn\\'t feel heavy at all!!Battery is huge and for full charging it does take time but it can easily last a day on 50℅ charge for normal usage so iam not worried abt battery life and 15w charger  !!6 GB ram is the most impressive feature of this phone,thank u samsung.64 MP rear camera and 32 mp front were treat to click , u don\\'t need any 3rd party app to adjust/beautify ur clicks such gr8 has been camera quality of M31!!Slow motion recording both front and back was the feature I was looking forward to and I loved it!!Iam not a heavy gamer but this phone can play pubg ,asphalt, mortal kombat and other heavy games wd ease!!Finger print reader works well this time in samsung M31 !Few tips and tricks:By def front camera is 21 MP in order to select 32 MP option select wide-angle option and then select 3:4 full option and u will see camera size 32 mp.For rear camera 64 mp option is available in options u hv to just look into itSlow motion is available in both front and back camera but super slow motion is available in rear camera only!

At low light and indoors it's just an average camera. Live focus selfies and night mode(front and rear)are useless. Live focus / portrait blurs out some portion of the face which is very bad.Call quality and speaker quality is fine.Samsung One UI is good but it misses out some of the important features as it's M series phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

Fingureprint reader is very nice it recognized very quickly, someime I found it's  unresponsive (3times in a 2 month) so used face recognition  or have to use PIN. Camera I like to use 64mp main camera at 3:4. It is amazing in revealing details of close up picture (you can see clearly and  detail of these tiny roof moss/algae, 3.5mm headphone jack was used for size comparison. When I use for scenery photos are good too. Only problem I found is sharpness of photo at highest zoom ( zooming photo to its highest) I think sharpness is good but not best. Samsung should improve processing of photo for excellent shrpness otherwise what  is benefit of giving better lens. I usually use  Adobe lightroom. Last 2 pics were processed in lightroom.  All other camera are  good too. Video quality is very good. All I'm very satisfied for having Samsung M31 phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing this review after using this phone for 4day.This is a best budget phone in the range of 15000 as whatever u want  all the things are inside this phone, if u compare this phone  With One plus 7T  Then in camera and battery backup  this phone get a Superb value. I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.I want to explain it's some feature as below1stly Battery 5star2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.3rd Front camera - 4star.4th Processor - 4star5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4starThese all ratings are out of 5.Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..\\n\\n\",\n",

He says his laptop has a Ram of 8GB and this phone has 6GB of Ram and because of this huge Ram, the phone runs like makkhan ( Indian Butter).2. The camera quality is like awesome. He never used to click these many pictures before. It has special food button which is specialized to click pictures of food items. The night camera can make night look like day, ITS THAT GOOD.3. AR EMOTICON : Now this is something I like more. It can turn you into emoticons which is like very cool.4. Battery life : After the first day when he charged the phone to 100%, he only plugged the phone into the charger after like 2 days. The c-port charger is also like an add on.I find it a worthy investment :D\\n\\n',\n",

It lasts long really long.Phone is super smooth with no lags. The display is very bright and the sound quality is awesome too.The camera is one of the best in the class and probably much better than anything available in this range. Please note that you have to change a few things in the settings to be able to use the camera in a better way. The default camera mode is controlled to conserve memory.The only annoying thing is that few apps are automatically installed with software updates.And, then you have to take the extra effort to locate it and remove it.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  After using Samsung Note 3 for a good time, I shifted to M31. The huge battery has been a big relief for me and from the battery drain tension when going on a long trip. I don't use it for gaming so typically I have to charge twice in three days. You may need to keep for a long time for it to charge fully.  The screen display is sharp and clear.The build is good. It fell a couple of times from bed but the curved edges on the sides have prevented it from getting scratches. I don't like putting case or screen protector as it increases the weight and reduces the aesthetics. Also, don't put keys in the same pocket as it can give permanent marks on the glass. The black backside is a finger magnet and it will take some time for you to get used to it.I have given five stars also because of customer care which takes your error reports seriously.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  My previous two phones were Redmi note 3 and Redmi note 5 pro mainly because of the specs it offered and was th best option available that time. Well my heart wanted to again buy a Redmi phone again but mind did not allow that maybe anti China sentiments(not naive) and thought of using something different. Lets test try the change.They increased the price of the phone by 1000 rs during lockdown and it did hurt me but I still went ahead with the phone. I am using 8GB 128GB model. (Rs19500). It cost me 2k to 3k compared to other phones but dimag tha jo mann nai raha tha.Amazing battery. It definitely last a days use and I mean it even when you use it extensively apart from gaming. Surfing, videos, movies , you can do alot of other thing it will last 20 -28 hours and battery wont disappoint you.Security: i felt more secured using a Samsung phone than the redmi phones that i have used earlier. This is something personally what i have felt.Camera: Camera quality is good and i did not get lags while clicking pictures. Honestly I do not click much pictures so this does not really matter to me.Display and Touch: Display is fine but screen gets streched, related to resolution mainly so you may not be a able to see the score of football matched on the left corner, or youtube subtitles in the full screen mode. Touch could haven better i felt and more quick.Performance: I did find issues here and i am really disappointed with the performance even though i compensated with higher ram i do feel lag while opening apps switching between apps, handling multiple task and lag here and there. I am bit skeptic not sure how much the performance degradation will happen down the line. The performance is not seamless and not upto the mark. could have been better.Ui: i am not enjoying the samsung ui and it is complicated and it does not have basic features of spamming callers or catergorzing or app lock and takes time to search through the settings option(major lag there). The navigation is difficult. I really enjoyed miui.Sound Quality: Decent not amazing not bad..okaish it wont thrill you. Could have been better.Gaming: I am not using this phone for gaming and not sure how it work but i think it wouldnt be a great performer with high end graphic games.For me Battery and Performance, ui should be top notch.  that is my only requirement. 5 for battery, 3 for performance and 2.5 for ui.There are far better phones available then again non-chinese this is the only best option.This is will get done all you day to day activity.Maybe an I buy an iPhone next time would make me an I-diot?

I've been using this phone for over 2 months now and all I can say is that I shouldn't have taken the negative reviews lightly. The phone lags even with minimal activity. The fingerprint sensor is almost insensitive and reminds me of old samsung phone touch screens. The camera quality is amazing but only after you adjust the settings to different(highest) resolution. Battery life is subpar and way lower than what I thought a battery this size would perform but the fast charger takes care of that problem to some extent . The inbuilt operating system lacks any applock which has to be installed from play store. The phone is okay for someone who doesn't use or expect much from his/her phone except basic functionality but I'd recommend going for a different phone if you're a heavy user or for gaming.\\n\\n\",\n",

So the 6GB RAM is a MYTH. You hardly get 2GB of RAM space  for your applications .Memory : Out of the 64GB of memory , the system UI and OS takes a whopping 12GB of memory space .Pros:Camera is decent  and Fingerpint access is quite smooth.Summary: Phone heating up is a huge disappointment.

I am not that interested in camera, but my shutterbug friends told me that the pictures taken through it are good. Another valuable feature is Dolby Atmos, which improves the sound output quality of the Bluetooth speaker connected to it.I do not have any flaws to say regarding the device. A slight quibble is that the back panel catches fingerprints quite easily, but using a back case solves it.\\n\\n',\n",

Although when you plug-in it says \"Fast charging\" it still takes approx 3.5-4 hours to fully charge. Too slow in my opinion.2) Some of the preloaded apps from Samsung are very annoying. Specially the camera app has one very bad feature. After you record a video and want to see it, it starts playing automatically. If you want to scrool forward, backward, pause etc, there is no control. It has to open the video again using a different app and then you can control. Such an annoying thing.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Excellent phone with all the necessary specs for a fantastic deal. I bought this at 14999. At that price I needed 4 things:a) Good processing power and RAMb) Sufficient internal memory & expansionc) Good batteryd) Good cameraI'm very happy with the first 2. I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography. The sensor is what matters and it is good enough for this price point.Some of the built-in features are good.In short, I'm happy with my purchase.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I bought this phone about a month back and it has a super annoying thing. The phone auto restarts whenever it thinks to do so. Its not a hardware issue as such, its by design. Try googling this issue for M31 and many other users are frustrated. Best part is there is no solution to it. Next problem is its too slow, it doesnt matter if it has 8 GB ram and 4.5 GB shows as free, if you just try to scroll a whatsapp chat window, or simply type a text message, first word starts to appear on the screen after you have typed entire sentence. A usual \"suggestion\" given by ppl is free up RAM and storage or disable  \"auto-restart\" in device care (which is not even enabled). My phone is almost new and i dont play games or do heavy multi tasking. Ram is never 50% utilized and storage is hardly 30 GB used out of 128 GB and yet you cannot even type a text message nicely.On the positive side, camera and battery are as expected. However, trust me, you\\'ll get frustrated by its lag and restart feature.Verdict :- Its a trash.\\n\\n',\n",

Fingerprint sensor not accurate4. Difficult to find required options5. No removable battery (if it's hung we can remove and fix the issue)6. No headphones (marketing separately from all companies)7.

The device is quite user friendly and handy. The battery backup is around 1.5 - 2 days on average phone usage. I haven't encountered any lag or malfunctioning of the device yet.

Perfect for who need extra battery. 48 hours of music playback and as much as 8-10 hours of video playback. Superb battery backup.  Camera quality is superb. Micro performance is owsm.  Face reader and fingerprint sensor is very good. No new changes in display. It's look like you still using old samsung mobile. Connectivity is poor......... WiFi calling is available.

       " \"\\n\\n  Well I wasn't too sure when others mentioned seeing dust around the packaged product but to my surprise I had similar experience. The phone had dust particle all around it. On top of that the package did not have even sim card ejector. I am deeply disappointed for that fact that I had to give it 1 star just because of its poor packaging and not so good first experience. In fact its sim card tray is so fragile that I am really afraid to push it even with moderate force.Cannot say much about the product quality as I am yet to experience it.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is after a couple of weeks of usage.Overall, I like the device. Few things that needs improvement.1. The screen: Due to lockdown, I haven't been able to get a tempered glass. But that is no excuse for seeing the scratches on the screen. The phone hasn't fallen even once since I got it, but I see several scrathes on the screen. How poor is the glass quality?2. The fingerprint sensor is a dud. Only after repeated attempts does the phone unlock. Maybe work on it before manufacturing the newer stock.It is a great phone in it's price range but just because you are decreasing the price, doesn't mean you can compromise on the quality. Because if it does, there is no point marketing cheaper models if they are substandard.\\n\\n\",\n",

It just cracked and stopped working after accidentally dropping from 1 ft.And Samsung service centre asks hell lot of money to repair(1/3 of mobile price) and taking lot of time (1-2weeks) to fix.If you buy this phone make sure you don't drop.\\n\\n\",\n",

Cameras are awesome it's a bit warmer and soft images but details are amazing and other colours.....Guys literally there are loads of features and don't want to write an essay over here it will be tedious for you all to read....Trust me I'm using it as my daily driver and had no issues ya it may not have 90Hzs but who needs it in day to day budget life.

It works even better if in the night one puts it on battery saver mode.Build - The phone build looks rugged. Its back is very smooth so feels like it will slip off the hand. The thickness is slightly more but its a compromise for the large battery it holds.Camera - the output is really good and crisp. Photo quality and videos quality is nice.Sound - The phone has one speaker, but sound quality is really decent.Cards - it has dedicated slots for 2 SIMs and a memory card. But with 128GB one would not need much !I have eventually bought 4 of these for within the family and noticed some build issue. On the back camera, I observed that camera slot should be slightly out of the body. But when I checked one phone, I saw that the level was merged with the back cover. That is a concern for me. With this, I actually noticed the same on the other phones and realised that the back cover needs to be pressed a little to allow the camera slot to pop out.Now I am afraid that this could be manufacturing defect.I also had a passing comment from one of the amazon delivery guys that the phone is the most commonly returned phones these days.

Sound quality is good but not loud as generally  observed for other Chinese smartphone. Memory is 6 GB ram and 128 GB internal memory. But most bloatware apps are given in this smartphone. But memory is enough for those whom which like installing  gaming app or heavy application. Camera quality is very awesome. Selfi camera is very  good and main camera works good in light and dark as well. Flashlights  provides for both front and rear cameras. Images taken from this phone are attached.\\n\\n\",\n",

Also I've posted photos shot on this phone for reference.Pros:•Samsung's one UI is way better than the competition like Redmi's crappy MIUI.•The camera's are just too good, the HDR shots are amazing and the 64mp rear and 32mp front camera modes are just the cherry on top.•6000 mah battery is absolute overkill for a phone at this price.•The screen is really good, it's Amoled and can get pretty bright outdoors and pretty dim for indoors too.•The processor is really good too, enough for any task u throw on this.•Fingerprint scanner is on the back instead of in the screen thus it's faster, more reliable and better.•Amazon delivered the phone in 24 hrs with exchange so it was amazing.Cons. :•No fastcharger in the box even when it supports it, so charging to 100% takes too long.•In wide angle camera, there's no lens correction like in Samsung's Hughes end phones so photos look weird at the corners(I've uploaded a wide angle photo for reference).•phone can get a little bit hot while gaming, but not crazy hot so it's fine.•The 64mp photos are not that crisp so I just stick to normal camera mode.\\n\\n\",\n",

Samsung just has brought a best phone for us under 20k.Since, I've been using this product, I found it better than any other phone in market. The most impressive  thing I find is it's UI, battery, camera and smooth screen(higher refresh rates). It's camera is really fabulous one. The battery of this phone do never let you down from using. It's UI is too user friendly. I found it best in every aspect. It's terrible combination of it's price and features makes me mad. Guys, I solemnly recommend you to have purchase of this product.thanks!Hopefully, I think you find this review helpful.#SAMSUNG #SAMSUNGM31 #M31#GOMONSTER\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Being an iPhone user for 4 years, I was skeptical about switching to Android. Yet, the Samsung M31 got my attention right at the moment I saw it on Amazon.And it has surpassed all my expectations and more. I've never been this satisfied with a phone's performance at this price range.It is absolutely amazing in all aspects from camera to battery. Performance is smooth. I'm not a gamer but occasional PUBG was a lag free experience.Overall, this is the best you can get for 17K right now.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  M31 is equipped with all the features what one wish to have in mobile. After reviewing all makes and comparison, I choose to have M31 and I must say, my decision was not wrong. Amazon delivered the product before their committed date. 6gb Ram, 128gb Storage, Octa core, 64MP quad Camera is more than enough. Functional Performance is very good. 6000mah Battery performance is too good. No need to charge even for next day. Camera also delivers good picture quality throughout day and night. Sensors like Biometric & Compass are very useful. I am truly enjoying M31. Samsung has indeed done a great job by launching M series compared to other make mobiles at very competitive price.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Camera domain is not a great piece here. My other device Asus 5Z performs well with 8mp than this 64mp shooter. Samsung should develop this camera's performance asap.Battery is fantastic. Gets thru 2 days easily.UI & moderate multitasking is smooth.Hardware is well built and feels sturdy.But still, added protection of screen guard and case is must.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Remember:* Galaxy M series phones don't have Knox security, so you won't get features like Secure folder, Samsung Pass, Samsung Pay, and other Knox-dependent services.* Galaxy M series phones run One UI 'Core', so features like Good Lock, Bixby are not compatible.* Samsung phones generally struggle in network reception in areas where coverage is poor. If there's strong network coverage, then you won't notice any difference.Otherwise, it's a decent phone for at around 15k.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Pros:1. Great battery life. Reminiscent of the old nokia phones which never used to die.2. High quality display.3. Smooth and fluid performance.Cons:1. Fingerprint reader non-responsive sometimes2. Camera quality is only decent. Pro mode does not give much options like ability to adjust aperture and shutter speed. Maybe you can get access to those from some other app in the play store.3. Touch unlock available but not touch lock which could lengthen the life of the power button. Again have to depend on some play store app for this.Overall a great buy for anyone looking for fair performance and good battery life.\\n\\n',\n",

Camera quality I found very good,  though professional reviewers mentioned low on low light, I found it otherwise, as it takes good pictures without any issues focus is not lost, flash is powerful enough to take those pics in absolute dark.I recommend anyone to buy the phone just closing their eyes. For price tag of 17K it is simply awesome no need to invest 25k, 35k for smartphone as it gives more features for the price of 17K\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Review after 4 days usage:The phone is very good in terms of what it offers for 16 thousand mid range segment. Pros,cons and final verdict below.Pros:1. Camera is solid. Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah3. Display is crisp and very sensitive4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.Cons:1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Giving review after Using it for two days.  Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.Pros-1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.Average features-1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.Cons-1. No cover provided within the box.2. No headphones provided.3. No Samsung secure folder.4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. 👍\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I bought the Samsung M31 6GB 128GB version for 16k. I use mostly online shopping apps, Streaming apps, chat, video calls.Pros1. SAMOLED screen, Pleasing to look....2. Battery life, for me with moderate use it lasts for 2 days.3. Camera Front and Back. Especially I love the Front camera...For selfie lovers it is a boon. Back camera is good but I can spot some color deviations in pictures taken using back camera as the real color is not seen in picture. But for me it is not an issue as I not using it frequently.4. Stylish looks.5. No major heating issues as I could see persons having competitors mobiles are complaining a lot about this.6. Even after 20 to 30 drops I dont see any visible even minor damage to the screen or body. Very well built device.Cons,1. Finger peint sensor and face recognition takes bit longer time then competitors devices to detect.2. Plastic body behind is fingerprint magnet and also can be easily scratched with out case. I dont like using a case so it is a issue for me.Even if you use a case you have to choose a good quality one as the bad ones themselves leave some scratches in long use3. Charging time...I know it is directly proportional to battery capacity but bit more faster charging would have been handy. Tome charging times are 3 hours 15 mins with normal charging and 2 hours 35 mins with fast charging.4. Whenever there is a software update mobile also shows a list of recommended apps that should be installed to complete the update. This came skipped but still it is annoying.Gamers.. please forgive me as I am not going to mention anything regarding the gaming performance as I have never tried even a single game with this mobile.Mobile is worth the money and my Rating is easily above 4 but if metal case and bit more faster charging options are provided I will be happily rate it 5.Thanks for the patience to read the complete review.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Alert: This will be very common man review not a technical one so if you are looking for technical review kindly skip it.Samsung M 31 has been great buy owing to its monster battery  life. I am a new mom and purchased this mobile  when my infant was 2 months  old. The battery lasts pretty long even after playing multiple YouTube videos and being on long video calls (due to lockdown). I don't get time charge my phone properly though.Sound quality: The sound is loud and clear over calls and also during entertainment sessions of movies and video.Camera Quality: The reason I opted  this phone was I wanted  good camera to capture precious moments of my little one. So far it has been serving  the purpose. I can't comment for outdoor photography as we are all home bound owing to pandemic.Screen: The display colours and picture resolution is great owing to full HD Amoled Display. But Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is my savior as my mobile has been kicked and slipped multiple times (I am using it without a screen guard and back cover). Further  the Accidental Touch feature is awesome as I mostly  have an infant in hand while using the mobile.Body: The body is non slippery offering good grip but there will lot of finger impression left on back.Fingerprint Sensor: Only thing that doesn't  pleases me its fingerprint sensor quality which could have been better. It takes times sometimes  or I have place finger multiple times.Face recognition features works well for me and it unlocks the phone from various angles even when I am using spectacles( this becomes a problem in various other mobiles.)Overall I am happy  with the purchase so far after two months of use.\\n\\n\",\n",

The OneUI from Samsung is intuitive, responsive and convenient to use. Best is that the device is 'Made in India' :) ... a highly recommended phone. The only con is the front camera could have been a 'pin-hole' form factor but then one easily gets used to the 'U-cut' camera form-factor in a matter of a few days.Overall a must have device and highly recommended on all fronts - good camera / display / processing / battery / looks.\\n\\n\",\n",

It does take a bit of time to get fully charged. But once that's done, it'll easily last for more than a day.4. The earphone slot is at the bottom of the phone. I personally like it on the top.

But .5 is to be added for the low price range and .5 is to be cut for the not so 64 camera quality. So i go with 4.5*\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I would say this is a better phone as compare to Redmi note 9 pro max. The reason is very subjective but I will try to answer few of them.The first and foremost is the premium look and feel of this phone which is unlike the Redmi note 9 pro max. The next is the camera quality it’s really outperform as compare to anything which rate me as to offer. Next the overall hamlet screen over here is much better as compare to redmi note 9 pro max.Lastly it all depends on how much you have to spend on a given phone but having a Samsung phone can always give you assurance that it will last long at least an year or two more as compare to any other brand.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  It\\'s been just 3 weeks since i bought this phone.When it comes to midrange models samsung has always been a good choice.Its performance and other features are always been decent.Galaxy M31 has some of the good features too.The First and the best thing about this phone is its display.Its 6.4\" super amoled display is awesome! Touch experience is butter smooth.If you watch lot of movies & videos then this phone is a right choice for you.Bcoz I watch lot of movies so its display quality is really great!It has a massive 6000mah battery which gives you a good battery life. I used to watch offline movies without break for more than 2 hours but the charge only decreases 10%.I think it\\'s really great! But if you are using social media and play games a lot or surfing internet for a long time then it gives you a decent battery life of 1 day or less.This is not for heavy gamers.Pls keep in my mind the charging time is too long.It charges only 34% in 1 hour.So it surely takes 2 and half hours to charge from 0 to100%.Even though they have given an Adaptive Fast Charger it charges slowly.Due to its heavy battery and 8.9mm thickness I thought it would be bulky but surprisingly it doesn\\'t feel heavy or bulky in hand.Thanks to its curvy finish.Cellular call quality is good.It has a single Speaker which is loud and audible.Sound through ear phone also really good.Camera takes decent photos.It has got wide angle and macro too.I have posted some sample shots here .Color Saturation is good.Camera has some more features which I haven\\'t used it yet.Selfie camera is good. When it comes to performance I would say it\\'s not bad at all.I haven\\'t seen any stutter or lag so far.Gaming performance is also good.I am not a fan of PUBG so I haven\\'t installed it.I have Real Racing 2 which played really good without any lag. Some of them has said in their review that the phone has some heating issues but in my experience the phone doesn\\'t heat much while playing games or watching movies or doing any other task.It gets heat while charging but it\\'s normal I think.In this price range you can get lot of other brands with very good spec.But at the end of the day its SAMSUNG.Due to its brand value the pricing is high for this specs.So finally its user\\'s choice to go for what they wish.Overall the phone is good in all aspect.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Beautiful screen with vibrant colours and a wonderful battery life is all I needed and Samsung galaxy delivers it to the dot. No compromises there on the humongous 6000 all day long or should I say all 2 days long battery. And the screen is brilliant with popping colours and eligible under sun.The blacks are deep as it should be on an amoled. Decent gaming is welcome. And the camera is no slouch the quad cam setup comes up with the best of modes. So when you go online with your pictures you don't feel bad at all. Camera has been done rightly. When you can watch Netflix in Full HD there are not a lot of phones providing this option in this segment.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I have ordered this mobile on 20/07/2020 and got delivery on time i.e. 24/07/2020. I have chosen M31, 8 Gb RAM version. Earlier I have used Motorola mobiles (which are good and rugged one) and this is my first Samsung mobile and I think I have made a good decision. Rest time will tell in long term use but first impression is great.So list of Positive points:1. Battery is very of good rating 6000 mAh. i do cycle rides using strava which uses GPS continually and to my surprise after using strava app for nearly 5 and half hour which include clicking photos dropped battery level from 100 % to 75% only. Which I think is very genuine.2. Processor is fast and efficient with almost no lag.3. Camera is definitely a plus point of this mobile. It will not disappoint you.4. RAM size is good as per today’s usage and I have opted for 8 Gb RAM so that in future after updates no issue arises. Other wise 6 Gb is also fine if you are going out of budget. (Here I want to mention that I am not a mobile gamer)5. Super amoled screen by Samsung is just awesome.6. User interface is very good with many good options and it will enhance core android experience. You can uninstall or hide default apps that you do not like on your mobile.7. Internal Memory is enough i.e. 128 Gb over that you get a dedicated micro SD card slot so that is impressive.8. Finger print sensor works very fast and efficiently.Now coming to negative points from my point of view1. Volume of loud speaker is bit less. If finger or something else comes over speaker it reduces volume drastically.One neutral point is that it comes with a battery charger of 15 watts only which is bit low for 6000 mAh battery but at same time very fast charging is not good for life of battery. May be Samsung engineers did what is best for their product.Final words \"It’s a good mid range mobile by Samsung with impressive performance”\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  DISLIKES:I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product  Defects:No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:-headphone audioJack not working-caller audio receiver not working-speaker not workingVideos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2× speed.Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.LIKES:Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.WHO can Buy:-Camera is priority-Wants some bigger battery-day to day regular usage-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wiselyPHONE WONT' SATISFY:-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.-onscreen finger print sensor-A51Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.For this price,this is a real mega monster.REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer's😁\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is my 3rd phone in Galaxy series. Galaxy series from Samsung is widely known for great phones with great features, but this one M31, is great even from Budget point of view. I did purchase on First Day First Show, when this was launched. Reason is number of reviews I had read on YouTube. Almost 20+ reviews I checked. I also read number of issues on Samsung forum / various blogs/forum etc. Every piece of information convinced, this is the best phone in this budget. Extreme value for Money.My smartphone journey has been quiet diverse in terms of various companies, so I am able to compare / differentiate various features, with hands on experience.From Year 2012 : Samsung Galaxy S2 > HTC Incredible 2 > HTC Rhyme > Samsung Galaxy Note 2 > LG G Vista > LG G6 > Redmi Note 3 > LG Q6 > Redmi Pro 6 > Samsung M31 : To year 2020.Following is my experience with M31, after a month of usage.Good: (for M31)- Android 10! Great looking version & beautifully customized by Samsung. Even in 10th edition, Samsung was fast to roll out update.- Mammoth display, my kids can actually use it properly for school online classes, as screen is sufficient when viewed from near distance.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 mAh battery is NEED of the times, with so much dependence on online activities. I use it full day + almost half of the time on HOT spot. Still, battery works for a 1.5 to 2 days. Charging is very fast, but not ultra fast. 30 min can increase around 50% battery.- Both the SIM support 4G (that’s plus), as we can practically use 2 JIO SIM for almost double the data, without any switchover.- Separate SD Card (up to 512 GB), actually is a great feature. Existing memory of 128 GB is sufficient as of now & SD cards (high capacity) are not cheap as such. So, Samsung did a right thing to provide enough memory from beginning.- Mobile speakers is good for normal music (less bass) & conference call. You actually feel part of the room, when conference call over speaker.- Camera is really good. So many features re there & I am yet to fully know them, as my basic usage is not for photography, but my children makes great video from this phone.- Figure-print sensor response is good, but when finger is moist due to sweat / water, it doesn’t response. That’s problem with all the phone, but the moment you wipe your finger, you are good to go. Response time is ultra fast.- Thanks Amazon for delivering within 3 days, even in partial lock down conditions.Not So Good: (for M31)- Not thin & light. Additionally, I have put up a sturdy cover + glass, so weight increased heavily. After few days you get used to it.- Doesn’t come with Samsung Security feature (like other galaxy series premium phone). However, Samsung does offer S-Secure app to lock certain apps with finger scan.- To many Samsung related apps (like global goal etc) & many of them are still to be known what it does. But Samsung can reduce such apps to save memory. You can disable few of them.- SMS can’t be deleted with a swipe (like in case of redmi),that’s important as many of the OTP/temporary messages should be deleted to reduce clutter.- Mobile torch can’t be switched of with a phone power button. This is a required feature, instead of going to notification & switch off torch.-- No light sensor in front, as it helps to avoid call going in hold during conversation. I read on Samsung forum, that front camera is used, so we have to hold phone in particular normal angle, that will ensure that call doesn’t get disturbed. Now, little used to it.- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. Apps run like butter & it never gives a message of storage space running out, in spite of heavy storage.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.If you are looking for a sub 20k feature rich phone, go for M31/Samsung. As it is far batter than any other Chinese options available, which are good in flashy advertisement, but in long run performance, they can’t match Samsung. I have been user of\\n\\n\",\n",

I will also give feedback for the same on samsung community page.(ohh my nationalist feeling during border tensions and determination to not buy chinese untill they are same)SAMSUNG M30 (5000 MAH) which I bought for my father WAS GUD FOR ALL OF these problems(but is doesnt have gud camera as m31 offers)The Product m31 is gud but I will suggest you to go for m21 insteadm21 has everything that this phone has (in 14000). I am telling U macro cam doesnt makes sense even for photography addictsthere is no use of extra ram with this processor (4gb is enough)Now talking about m31PROS:ImpressiveImpressive LUK and designgud rear camera, crystal clear photosas told by companygud front camera with features like Bixby and AR doodle and all told by comp. and all works really wellgud displaygud UI A bit heavyThank You VeryyYY MuchH....!!\\n\\n',\n",

Between 2013 and 2020, I must have bought atleast 10 phones. This time I had to buy a Samsung only because I had to buy a non-Chinese brand and other non-Chinese brands' mobiles  were out of stock.  Bingo!, Samsung didn't fail to disappoint me this time too. 6000 mAh battery lasts me a day with almost 15% by 8PM after a full charge in the morning. I must mention that I don't play any games and I am a basic user. Just checking messages, making calls for around an hour and around 2 hours of You Tube or other video platforms.  The last phone I used was priced at 7999 and it had around 50% battery at 8 PM. The inbuilt keyboard is one of the worst I have used.  Read a lot of praises of One UI but its not good compared to others. Many apps like First Cry, Amazon take too much time to open from the Recents tab. So many extras installed. Screen I can't say as I mostly get to watch videos at max 720p, camera is a major upgrade over my last used phone so I liked it. Fingerprint reader and face recognition are good. Call quality is Good. Speaker volume is Ok for ringing for incoming calls but not OK for watching movie unless you have vulcsn hearing or there is pin drop silence around you. I have to put my hand over the speaker grills sometimes while watching movie.  PS: No, I can't use ear phones. There's a baby at home. Have to put an ear to him too.\\n\\n\",\n",

Camera is okay, battery is great although it takes lot of your time for charging, so full charge can happen only in the morning after you put it to charge the night before you sleep.  Do get a cover when you buy one as it is quite slippery to handle. Blue looks great, Plastic body though feels cheap.

I am using 6 gb + 128 gb space black varientPros:1)super display- super amoled brings viewing experience to next level.2)mega battery- enough for full day heavy usage. People who are interested more in social media browsing, its a major advantage. You need not to worry for battery backup as this phone has a power bank inside.3) amazing camera- camera quality is just awsome. 64 mp camera adds life to images.4) samsung assurance - this product has samsung brand value and id supploes with high quality finish and long lasting durability5) no heating issue- even if you use phone for hours you would not feel any heating at the back.Cons:1) slow charging - even though samsung claims to have equipped the device with fast charging then also actually phone take close to 1.5 hours for full charge from 30 % to 100%. This might be due to large battery size proportionaly making charging time to increase.2) missing led notification- though its not a major thing to note but could add value if provided.3) As claimed , processor is not blazing fast, though this phone is great for day to day useage but gamers may feel little disappointment while playing high resolution games.Overall its a great budget phone for modrate users and media lovers.\\n\\n',\n",

There is a more option in camera like background changes,food option ,slow moo...if you want to buy 64mp camera phone u will go for Samsung m31.6000mah battery,64 MP camera,32 mp front camera,fast finger print sensor,fast charging and with all this benefit the price is 16000 only thq Samsung for this awesome product\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Camera quality is very poor, 64mp image is just a joke. Mi note 8 pro has better image quality compared to this phone. Do not believe paid product reviews.Display is good and mobile is light weight though it has 6000mah battery.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Great value for money phone as a primary as well as secondary phone.1. Great battery life as charge once and forget it for next 2-3 days depending on use.2. Camera is also very good in day light but stuggle in night but overall good from price point of view.3.Display is crisp with good visibility in direct sunlight and the best value phone under 18k.4. Fingerprint reader is accurate and fast to open phone and secure as well.Far better then Chinese phone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I had previously used Note 5, S8, and Note 9 before switching to M31. Foremost reason was massive battery life, which has proved right.Forget daily charging. Even with heavy use, phone will be on for more than 2 days without any charging.Rest are too perfect... camera for daily use, looks, balance, screen vividness...Finally do not go for Vivo or Xiomi or Realme etc. Buy this phone and never regret.\\n\\n',\n",

Later once i kept full charging(100%) and starting using it is normal.

Internet would just go out suddenly for few seconds, camera quality good but video auto focus has some issue.

       " '\\n\\n  As visible from the other reviews, it is a good phone, I just wanted to concentrate on some \"not so good\" points for users for whom these might be of particular relevance:- if you turn on the router-wifi (hotspot) forget about using the bluetooth connection, the sound comes and goes- if the wifi signal is weak i get the info \"Ready to connect when network quality improves\" in the same location where i could still use the wifi, even if very weakly, with my previous phone.- I was expecting more from the battery, it does not last for two full days.Otherwise I am very happy.\\n\\n',\n",

Another interesting feature is a macro camera.. the wide angle camera is very good too. The basic camera has excellent low light capability and gives a bright image (is it the screen or the camera?).. in short the camera(s) perform much better than expected.And the phone feels solid.The battery again is just great. What's the point having lots of features and not being able to use them? The battery makes them available and reliable. I think this is the first smartphone around with acceptable battery life. For a 15K phone (introductory price), this is real good! Great job Samsung. And nice delivery Amazon, I received it the day before the lock down!\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  This one is the best when I bought this in the sub-20k price range.Maybe the newly launched M31s is the only that can best it.Spec wise even better than A series which is the next grade of Samsung.Good screen, good camera, good battery life. Multiple unlock options with face and fingerprint. Latest Android version. What more can you ask.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I had a horrible experience after buying Samsung M31 immediately after it's launch. The screen display got non-functional just in three months of usage. My display got blacked out just in two minutes while I was watching video. Screen went completely black as if it's switched off. The mobile didn't have any physical damage and mishandling. There was not a single game installed and I used the mobile during lockdown just for calling and and watching videos. When I contacted the Samsung service center they called it's liquid damage called bleeding and it comes under physical damage and therefore I will have to bear the repairing charges of display change which is 5000 rs. I am really disappointed with the service and company policy where the consumer is exploited for non-functioning of mobile even though it happened on its own. Buying such an expensive mobile which doesn't work for few months is really not acceptable and company should take a note of that and act accordingly in favour of the consumer. Substandard products are being made and delivered to the customer and charged in the name of policy terms and conditions.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This phone has worse camera in slow motion. After that 6000 mah battery is fake thing it seems to be 4000 only. And in the last but not the least u cant hear other person voice while u r doing calls. Its my worse experience for samsung phone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I don't know where to start speaking about this amazing phone and its amazing features.Samsung has truly given us a gift with the M31 model.The monster battery of 6000 MaH is definitely the higight, but apart from the amazing battery we need to take out time to appreciate how beautifully Samsung has balanced the weight of this huge battery in this handy phone without it being bulky. It is truly crazy!I have been using this phone for a little over a week now, and I am just in love with everything it has to offer.The camera quality is just amazing, people just need to make sure that they set the default output of the pics at 64 Mp as the phone naturally clicks pics at 16 Mp mode to save space.I love that my phone is add free (which is such a relief!) And all the other features are just so fun to use!This phone is seriously a SNATCH at the price Samsung has introduced it. The best of features at such a great deal.Just go for it without a blink if you are looking for a phone under 20000.This is truly a treat to use. You wont regret it.\\n\\n\",\n",

There is no shortcut for flash light. (Like press lock key 2 times to on or off / shake devices to on or off.)3. Many devices have screen shot  shortcut/ Gesture  like swipe download through 3 fingers ant it ll take screen shot. Samsung is most powerful devices this feature should have in this devices too..4. Sounds quality is very poor in wired earphone. I jave compared with many devices with same earphone Samsung is very bad in all others. Dolby atmos is not good in Samsung.  Lenovo K4 note gives more output then Samsung.  Poor bass in Samsung.5. When I start snapchat app it will take more time to load and run camera. Other brands phone works well in this price and specifications.6. Screen quality and brightness is good.7. There is full coverage of network still its shows out of coverage area many time.

Functioning is quite satisfying. Most importantly, a very good smartphone in this range and it is made in India as well.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  64mp camera is not that good. Its image orocessing for 64mp is bad. It is like drawed picture more or less when you zoom more. Its colours are not that real and it doesnt feel that good to take 64mp photo. Its battery is good but at the first charge it took ages for me to get 100 percent. But after that it got quicker i.e it got to its original speed of charge. Software and its ui looks premium and good. There is a little lag while you fast open recent apps ( You can see it rarely, but for some apps u see it for sure). But overall its good. You will see some features which are that useful to you but when you see it will feel good. I think samsung does it because it wants yo make us feel luxury( but luxury in the sense not that useful but it is there) and honestly it feels good to have it. You will feel it good, simple, elegant to have it in your hand.\\n\\n',\n",

Not expected from at least Samsung.. earlier I had used Le 2, Lenovo, micromax, Infinix, realme, xiomi and currently I am using Honor and IPhone 7.. every experience was a charm but this time, it’s very disappointing..Coming to Samsung M31, purchased it a month ago.. 7 days back the mobile started behaving abnormally.. it’s touch stopped working frequently and at times, the mobile started operating and clicking on different parts of the screen on its own..I went to Samsung service Center and they told that it might be software problem and so they went for a software reinstallation.. I got the mobile after that and it started working fine, but again the next day, the same problem arised..Now they are telling that it might be the problem of the motherboard and I have to wait for few days,,This is pathetic..

Screen - The Display is superb to say the least. sAMOLED display makes watching videos a delight!2. Camera - Few modes and video shooting in both rear and front camera is great. The enhancements dont make the photos look artificial which is great! However, can improve on the 64 MP mode - probably on OTA update can fix it.3. Battery - I have used phones with 5000 mAH battery for the last 2-3 years from Asus (Max series) - If I would rank that 5/5 because they would easily last 1.5 days without charge, this would be 4 +0.5 /5 ( 0.5 for fast charging, even if battery drains out fast). A full charge can last the day.  This is when I have medium to heavy usage of phone without gaming.4. Processing - Very smooth for 6GB, no lags whatsover!5. Some modes and features -•Dolby Atmos Sound mode for headsets is amazing!• Game mode has lots of features related to screen like screen recording, etc.• Fingerprint scanner is super fast too. Haven't tried the face unlock so can't comment on that.Overall, would suggest that if you want to couple the brand trust along with good features - definitely go for M31 !\\n\\n\",\n",

The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 64GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 64GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Battary Life:I have bought this phone for long battery and good Camera, however this phone disappointed me in both the cases.1.Battary Life: I am using this phone since 11th August 2020 and now it's 15 days.Phones battary got drained in just 04-05 hours of average active screen usage.This performance is worst than 3000 battery.2.Charging : even after 4:30 hrs of charging phone is not fully charged with given adaptor.This is one of the worst phone battery ever seen.I am getting frustrated because of this.II. CAMERA:So called 64mp camera, quality of camera is seems to be like 32mp camera and is not that much good.III.The worst part is, I have recommended this phone & he bought this phone and facing the same problemKindly replace the phone on immediate basis.We don't want to continue  with this kind of phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I\\'m writing this review after using the phone for a month, and here\\'s the detailed review of my experience using the phone.• BEST PARTS1) SCREEN: Straight up the most attractive part of the phone. The sAMOLED display is crisp, color accurate and legible even in the hardest of lights. And the Always-On Display is a bliss, with customisable clock faces and even options to place own photos. Since the display is AMOLED, this doesn\\'t cause much battery drain (about 1-2% more drain when keeping it \"Always On\" as compared to off). And the bezels are not noticeable much, and the screen is super smooth. The refresh rate is still 60Hz, but then it\\'s not geared towards gaming. 9/102) BATTERY LIFE: Absolutely unbelievable! The 6000 mAh battery is no joke and it delivers. I use my phone heavily (~10hr screen on time, with video calls, gaming and instagram scrolling) and still the battery lasts me a day and a half. Charging is also good, it takes almost 2.5 hours to get it from ~20% to 100%. 10/103) PERFORMANCE: The 6/64 variant caters to my needs perfectly. There is always more than 2 GB of RAM free, even when there\\'s 4-5 background apps open. Sometimes I minimise my game to respond to a notification, and then forget about it; and when I open it after 6 hours it\\'s still there in the memory. Phenomenal!The processor, now. Before buying the phone, I read a lot of reviews as I was skeptical about the processor. Snapdragon 730G is better, they said. But to be honest, I really don\\'t see the difference. This phone has never once lagged in my one month of using it. It is snappy and DOESN\\'T HEAT UP.  10/104) SOFTWARE: As soon as I started up the phone, I opened up the app drawer and removed all the apps that could be removed, and then disabled some I didn\\'t need and couldn\\'t be uninstalled (Samsung\\'s mostly), so that\\'s GREAT. Also, I ensured I disabled notifications whenever any spammy notifications arrived, and within two days my phone was ABSOLUTELY bloat-free.Samsung\\'s OneUI is beautiful. I have no other words for it. The dark mode goes well with the sAMOLED display, and is absolutely great to work with. I\\'d always been a fan of stock Android and Pixel, but OneUI changed me. 10/105) CAMERA QUALITY: I\\'m not an enthusiastic photographer, but as far as day-to-day photography is concerned, it is magnificent and highly detailed. You need to tweak settings in the Camera app to suit your taste and also set the resolution (64MP photos are 3:4 aspect ratio, but I prefer Full screen, for example). I also got GCam installed and that\\'s added benefit, if you care. The wide angle lens is nice! There\\'s barrell distortion at the edges but you get an option to automatically correct it in the settings. Macro camera is able to pick up details easily and really close to the subject.Front camera is equally good, able to capture details nicely. There\\'s also a wide angle mode for the front camera, though it\\'s just software and there isn\\'t an actual wide angle camera at the front. 9/10 for both!• NOT-SO-GOOD PARTS1) The speaker quality is not breathtaking. It does the job and is reasonably loud, but I prefer headphones or else my Echo Dot for audio, so it doesn\\'t matter.2) The back surface is \"glasstic\" and smudges easily. Get yourself a cover and you\\'re good to go.3) Fingerprint sensor is FAST but use it once with sweaty fingers and it can\\'t detect anymore unless you clean it.So, there you have it. If you want a no-nonsense phone with great battery, screen and camera, with NO ads (read: Xiaomi, Realme) and NO bloatware and a BEAUTIFUL UI, look no further. The Galaxy M31 is THE phone to go for.P.S. call quality and network is also flawless. I use airtel.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)Pros1. Great phone with 128 GB storage and 6 GB RAM at this price.  Definitely great  value for money.2. Total 5 cameras make it a great photography experience. (wide angle + depth + macro for close ups.3. 6000 mAh Battery lasts for more than 24 hr with moderate use. Charging is fast. Takes 2 hr to charge from  20 % to 100%.4. Switch over to USB type C cable which is going to be the future universal cable across all devices of all companies.Cons1. 128 GB memory is great but within a month it has started getting reduced with software updates. It is the same game that the mobile companies have been playing with the customers. One has to discard the phone while it is still working well because of depleting memory. Let me see how long I am able to use this phone despite my settings  to store most of the things in the SD card.2. Highest sound volume is also very unsatisfactory. In fact, the worst sound volume among all phones that I have used earlier including three different models of Samsung Galaxy.3. The positioning of cameras on margin is problematic because we are used to camera lenses positioned around the mid-line of devices. It is difficult to aim the camera with a side-aligned Macro lens.4. Default Font type and size is very small. Option of Samsung Font is provided and it has better readability.  But even after switching to Samsung font and increasing the font size through display settings it works on some websites but not on many others where the font remains small.5. The phone heats up while charging . I never experienced this heating while charging with any of my earlier Samsung phones..6. The charger has a USB Type C cable. Therefore, you have to make sure that you carry your new cable with you all the time on the go till it becomes the normal charging cable like the present Type B cables found in each home and office.7. Very difficult to take screenshots with M31 because the volume control and the on-off switch are on the same side adjacent to each other.8. Samsung has saved some money by not including  ear phones in the phone package.  Earphone  doesn't cost much but a new earphone with a new phone gives good feeling to customers. This was not expected from the cell phone giant like Samsung.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Seller must be banned... I ordered this handset twice.... First time it was ON inside the package.... I returned the parcel that time..... Then ordered again.... Today after opening the handset everything was looking good, but when open Sim slot it was very tight from inside.... When it ejected finally, the Sim slot was tampered... I think it's returned and repackaged handset sold by the seller.... So the seller must be kicked out from Amazon Prime...\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Its battery life is really amazing. I charged this phone from 0 to 100 in 160 mins. If you are heavy social media user you can use continously 10hrs with one full charge.Pros:Good wide angle cameraBest selfieGreat features like app timer and you can see how much you spended time in each day.It can be suitable fir even 13 years child too with parental control.Good display qualityFast responding with no hangsAll rounder.It owned its samsung exynos 9116 soc processer. Which prevent from loss of performance when heatingCons:Dust on phone will easily visibleDesign is lightly oldSamsung still remains the launcher no improvement in launcher.Charging time is little slow when compared to redmi latest phones\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Overall Good. 6GB RAM provides smooth operating of Phone along with Android 10 and One UI 2.0. Though fast charging feature is provided in this model, feels like its charging at normal speed and samsung needs to check with this. As I also own a Samsung galaxy M40 whose charging is really fast as compared to M31.Only drawback is that can't get proper sized tempered glass for this mobile. Hope Samsung will try to provide Proper accessories for any new Model they launch.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Great phone in all aspects at a pocket friendly price point. i was using several expensive brands earlier and i needed another phone for some generic use at home. i was looking for a good balance of quality, brand, performance and a decent price point. this samsung galaxy M31 fits that bill perfectly. i have been using this for several months now and i am extremely happy with it's performance. speed and responsiveness are great. camera quality is comparable to several expensive phones that i have at home. finger print sensor is a great relief and makes it highly usable. display quality, like all samsung devices is really superior. light weight on the pocket both in terms of it's real weight and also from the price perspective :-) Strongly recommend to budget conscious folks..\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Phone built quality is good. It's a very rigid phone. I have already dropped it thrice but thank God phone is working normal till now.Camera quality is AWESOME. It is best in this price range. But camera is not so quick. Phone gives lag while using camera.Battery life is normal if we see a 6000 MAh battery. My usage is mostly internet and I use Bluetooth connection also. I get around 8 to 10 hours of battery life when Bluetooth and location is on.Finger print sensor is working fine. But I think it could be a faster one.Phone is not so quick while using multiple windows. It gives lag.Overall I am fully satisfied with the phone performance. Highly recommended if you are searching a new phone in this price range. GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHT.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Best Mobile from Samsung I Purchased 2 handset from Amazon, In Just Rs:17499/ You get A Samsung Mobile with 128 GB of Internal Storage, 6GB RAM & 6.4 Inch Super Amoled Screen.Best part of it Mega Moster 6000 Mah Battery first from any Mobile Co.You can buy this Mobile without second thaught. I m enjoying 3 day of Battery life on moderate use.Thank Brand Samsung n Amazon quickly delivered to me within 12 hours.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I've got the 6GB+128GB variant and thanks to early access and Prime Delivery experience....Pro:1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.7. Price.Cons:1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protection🙂.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  with plenty of very good and expert reviews available for Samsung M31 for its deserving features and quality, I would like to share my experience as a user with vision impairment using screen-reader and Text-to-speech:1. Samsung mM31 features Samsung's own built-in screen reader 'voice assistant', hence Android Accessibility Suite doesn't come built-in. One needs to download it from playstore if the need be.2. Samsung's 'Voice Assistant' is an efficient screen-reader in itself, but those used to Talkback will find it less suitable in terms of gestures and other features.3. The camera is surprisingly accessible with the screen-reader telling you if face(s) get focused. I could click not-so-bad pictures as a totally blind person!4. Samsung's UI and in-built applications offer smooth and faster navigation while using screen-reader. Most of the buttons in Samsung's apps are labeled and hence accessible.5. Attending calls is most convenient with the volume-up button doing the job. Live caption is also another fantastic feature that will be useful for the hearing impaired people.6. There could have been an option to wake the Google Assistant using power button since 'Okay Google' comment is not all that convenient in travel and noisy places.Overall, Samsung M31 is a very good choice in this budget for the visually impaired / blind users too.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Pretty heavy phone to handle.great response time from one window to another, excellent refresh rate on the screen.Didn’t like was too much heating on the phone. May becoz of the 6000 mah battery at the back but it’s ok as most of phone do heat up.Battery life is something on how the person uses it, it’s recommended that use the phone till it indicates it needs to be charged say 15% or even 5%. And then charge the phone back again. To have healthy battery life.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  On the next day of release i.e 6.3.2020 ,  I purchased Samsung M31 , as I was very impressed with M20.Samsung the \" master in creating mobiles \" in the intrest of public and to their taste.

Easily lasts for 2 days.Awesome camera. The images captured are having enhanced colors that are very attractive. Better result in low light compared to my other 22k phone. Memory management, even high resolution images are of ambient size. Front camera result is really awesome.Processor. Its good and I did not find any lag since I bought the phone.Weight management and balanced body.Conc.Notch display and back mounted fingerprint scanner. Other phones come with punch hole display and in-screen or side mounted scanner. But the price is higher and also in many display is ips lcd and not super amoled. So its the preference by which you should decide.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  First of all I received the phone I was incredibly happyIt says it has 6000amper but I found it was not up to the expectationsIt takes around 3:30 hr to charge completely while it should only take approx 2:30 hr,even battery drains out quickly within 8-9hours on WiFi the battery turns from 100% to 17%-this is how 6000mah works????? ofcourse not!!!!It heats up a lot while charging like about to burstFor me it was a terrible experience ,I will not recommend anyone to purchase Samsung m31 , Samsung is a brilliant industry which makes brilliant and durable products but its only applicable to their high rated phones(above 60000rs)In the case of m31 they have too many compromises which reduces the battery efficiency,camera quality and all and you not need to waste even 17499rs for that you can get these lower performance even in the budget😉 of 6000rs,for me it's a high rated product with low I mean very low performanceBetter to by any other brand products in place of using this phone by Samsung!!!!!!!Anyways Samsung is the brilliant company but here they are making compromises in low priced productsSo same your time and money both,😁😁😁😁What's inside the box-adaptor with able,phone,warranty papers,pin and that's it😵😂And now I don't want the product coz for me even 17499rs matters alot\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  1. I'm writing this review after 120 days of usage, using the 6GB Ram /128GB version.2. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon - within 72hr delivery.(b) The phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(c) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(d) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo, realms and Mi. Works like a flash.(e) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(f) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. Front camera is average.(g) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(h) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking approx 3hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.(c) Finger touch has less sensitivity.5. Otherwise I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  It's a nice phone with good battery life, Camera is amazing-especially when coming from MI note 7 Pro or even GALAXY M30 S. Since I have switched from MI to Samsung, UI is not as convenient or familiar than my previous phone.I do not see a lot of properties when trying to restrict no of users for my hot-spot, either I can completly hide it or change password every time I do not want anyone to connect to my hot-spot (previously connected to my phone hotspot).Rest the phone is nice, it's is not 6.5 I personally like bigger phones but that is repayed by the amazing camera quality.No heating issues as of now. It takes quite some time to charge but battery backup is nice and usually goes through the day with heavy usage (WiFi, Gaming, Netflix and all).Go for it if you want to switch to Samsung its is even better than SAMSUNG A51. So please compare.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The camera of this phone is a total joke, it doesn't feel like 64 mp at all, front camera is even worse, and the wide angle camera is the funniest of all, it looks like image has been stretched unnaturally, the rear camera will capture good picture only when there is complete light, little bit of darkness and the camera quality becomes 2 mp. i was using oppo f5 which was launched in 2017 and the camera is way way better than the m31. This phone has a good battery life, display quality is good, fingerprint is not that fast but decent, this phone is not for gamers. You should buy this only if you like watching videos, listen to songs and use normal apps. Strictly Not for photography and gaming.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Phone is good. Little heavier for Samsung S series user.  Overall worth the money. But dissapointed with the charger they send with the phone. It started peeling second day itself. The black plastic coating is coming out exposing the wire inside. Didn't expect this.Update:After using it for almost 1 month , I found that internet world slow in this model. It's lags a lot.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  One of the best smart phones in the market right now, when it comes to the camera I have observed it takes awesome shots with front and back camera, and in low lighting it awesome.With day to day usage If you play heavy games like asphalt 9, pub g mobile exsynos 9611 gives awesome performances  with game booster I perfectly  maintain ram and processor for optimal performance and heating issue too minimal.Coming to battery life powered by 6000 mAH it gives best performance as of normal usage like social media, surfing taking shot, watching movie and listening to songs battery can last up to 1 and half day easily. When you do heavy gaming like pub g and all in full charge u can play 5,6 hours continuously.Coming to online streaming and entertainment  app like netflix and prime video it supports widevine L1 support as know as HD streaming or you can watch movies, series in high definition.Now the coming to design it samsung glastic  design which feel premium in hands and u water drop notch display with quad camera setup is just awesome.Now the trade mark and the best part of samsung smart phone display 6.4 inches, 1080x2340 Full HD super AMOLED display with 83.92% screen to body ratio.

The phone is really good in terms  of speed. I purchased the 8GB RAM + 128B internal memory version which is the best (at the time of my purchase).

This might be a major drawback of this mobile.Conclusion: If u are a gamer or a heavy user of multimedia. This mobile is not worth for your use. This is good for only those people who use it for nominal multimedia purposes.\\n\\n',\n",

SAmoled gives you feel of touch.4.Battery life is as expected. With continuous music listing and net surfing it will last a day.normal uses 2 days around. It's really monster.5. Camera is really awesome and in night mode it's clarity you can see. Super se upper. Wide angel feature is cool and you can cover larger areaYou may get upset when:-1. During phone update you may fill mobile is getting heated.2. S/R ratio is low which is good for your health but if network strength is low you may get call drop.3. Front camera is little lagging but through settings you can take perfect selfy.4.

I have brought  2 handsets i feel similar  issues in both of the handsets.I am not a tech bug but second phone user has raised concern  to amazon they have ask to install diagnostic  software  after that i have no idea what they have done to his handset.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This phone has mainly 3 main objective:Monster battery, camera and display.I will give review in details about this phone.Battery: with approximately 2hrs of gaming time and 7hrs of screen time battery life took almost 30-33hrs to come from 100% to 5-15%. As well as it took almost 4-4.5 hrs to fully charge from 5% to 100%.Camera Quality: I have attached few picture samples from ultra wide angle to macro to 64MP shot to 32MP selfie shot. The camera Quality is excellent but if Samsung could add the single take feature by some software update, this phone could be unbeatable at this price segment.Fingerprint reader: it's very responsive and took micro second to respond. It's face unlock feature is also great responsive.Processor: exynos processor is good but can't handle heavy game, expecting Snapdragon chipset later in this range as well as I really want ardeno GPU than this Mali, but due to having 6gb ram and 128gb storage phone didn't lag at all but I personally need the change in GPU at least.Speaker volume is average. Best advantage is having 3.5mm headphone jack port.Having 3 in 1 slot i.e. 2 nano SIM and 1 dedicated micro SD card slot.Back panel is very fingerprint catcher, but using a case can solve this issue.And that's all from my review, feel free to rate my review high and can ask me any queries related to this smartphone.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  OCEAN BLUE, 6+128The product was delivered to me on 8th March 2020,so i am reviewing it after 3 months.1. Camera QualityThe quad camera is awesome, even some shots can be compared from cinematic shots you can zoom the pic upto extreme extend.Front camera is 32MP and selfies are as good as the pics taken from rear camera Sometimes even better.Overall camera is excellent .2. DISPLAYWith the phone equipped with superamoled along with infinity display you can watch some videos on YouTube even on 240p and it gives the feel of 360p quality.Needless to say about HD video their views are crystal clear.Although the display is protected by Coring Gorilla 3 but i would suggest the buyers to apply screengaurd the quality of videos or the touchscreen functions would not be affected i can assure you for that.3. BATTERY LIFEThe most demanding feature in any cellphone.For normal usage like movies, calls, videos calls, music the battery would lasts upto almost 2days.On the otherhand if you are a heavy gamer like PUBG or CALL OF DUTY, then also you can play these games 8-10hours continuously.I have played PUBG on M31 8 hours continuously with 15% battery remaining afterwards.4. GAMEPLAYPUBG never lagsWhenever i am playing with my squad they say the game is lagging as some squad or any enemy is approaching but i never ever experienced any type of lagging during gameplay except the network error problem or sometimes when internet is not  working properly.Otherwise, if you are a pro player of PUBG you can reach CONQUERER rank with this phone.5. RAM & ROMThe buyer will get almost 110gb of user space as their some pre-installed and system apps.With 6gb RAM you are all set for smooth and fast gameplay and multifunction.6. FINGERPRINT READERYou can add more than one fingerprint.Beside that the sensor is at the back side so at times you can feel that the sensor should have been on screen otherwise the sensor responds quickly to the fingerprint.Overall it's best phone in the market below 20000.The only missing quality was 8gb ram according to my opinion but on 29th May 2020 8gb RAM variant was also been launched.The one and only drawback with this cellphone is its charging time as the battery capacity is 6000mAh but the charger is of 15W only so it takes 3hours to charge the battery 100%.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it\\'s M series of smartphones.Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.Rating: 5 of 5.Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.Rating: 5 of 5Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it\\'s awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that\\'s normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it\\'s ok at this price point.Rating: 5 of 5Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.Sound: 4 of 5Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can\\'t be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.Rating: 4 of 5.Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word \"Excellent\". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.Rating: 5 of 5Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.Rating: 5/5Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  *Looks_Premium*Samsung has gone with glasstic for the back of the phone — plastic that looks and feels like glass — which is smart, because it gives the phone a premium finish while keeping the weight low. And weight could have been a problem given that Samsung shoved a monster 6,000 mAh battery into this thing.And don\\'t let the \"glass\" in “glasstic” fool you, it’s still plastic and still prone to scratches, and it’s glossy, making the phone slippery to hold, especially for someone as butterfingered as I am. On the bright side, the phone doesn’t look cheap, unlike its predecessor.Battery Life- An Absolute BeastPacking a whopping 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M31 has managed to reach roughly the end of two days on a single charge, despite being connected to Wi-Fi for the majority of that time, with Bluetooth on and multiple wearables and a pair of wireless earbuds connected for good measure. That’s on top of the heavy use activities I mentioned previously. Simply put, you’d have to be a serious procrastinator to even think about draining the battery completely in a single day.Samsung Galaxy M31 – 4The Galaxy M31 proves that having a multi-day battery life doesn’t cost the Earth, and if you were planning on using the M31 as your main media device of choice, this unbelievable battery life paired with the phone’s AMOLED screen makes for a match-made in heaven. You could binge content for hours on this thing.The only letdown is the supposed inclusion of 15w fast charging, which I beg to differ. When hooked up to a power outlet, it took just over two hours to reach full charge from 8%. If charging your phone overnight is part of your routine then you’ll never have an issue here, but needing a quick top up before you leave your home is just out of the question.Camera Quality- Good but not BestGood quad rear camera setup - 64MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensorShots taken with the primary camera during daylight are quite satisfactory, images are detailed, especially the 64MP shots, and they showcase good dynamic rangeThe ultra-wide sensor, like on any budget phone, is a good addition - it takes social media-worthy images in great lighting conditions (in low-light, the quality dips and pictures look grainy and noisy, wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges)Photos taken in low-light looks good - switching to Night mode helps reduce grain in the output and further improves image qualityLive Focus shots are quite impeccable and the camera app does give you the option to set the level of blur before taking a shot - edge detection is very good and the Galaxy M31 does a good job of separating the subject from the backgroundThe macro camera takes decent shots outdoors (though, the quality dips when indoors and the output is restricted to 5MP in resolution)The 32MP selfie camera is quite good and takes detailed selfies (though, in low light, the quality goes down a notch and results are grainy)Overall, the cameras on the M31 are good for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title crowned to the POCO X2)Overall Verdict:Samsung\\'s Galaxy M31 delivers the promise of long-lasting battery life and one of the best in its class in the market. In the camera department too has improved a lot over the predecessor.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Got this after my long stint with the Lenovo Zuk Z2 plus. Jumping from a Snapdragon (820) to an Exynos was difficult, but had no other choice. After a lot of searches and collating data and feedbacks, went for the Galaxy M31 (6+128). Was planning for an 8gb model but was not sure how good Exynos 9611 would handle tasks, so went with one level down. To be honest this phone does the job very good and more than what is expected. Back is a finer print magnet and the open camera is prone to damage unless a good back cover is put on. App loading time is a bit high. Fingerprint and face unlock is fast though the face unlock takes a longer time sometimes. I tested face unlock in dark environment and worked good as the brightness fills up your face from the device to capture the face. Similarly works for night time low light selfies. Games run smooth with minor frame drops at high settings otherwise you wouldn't find any (I am not a gamer though tried quite a few for sometime off in the lockdown). Has a specific game booster mode. There's no lag on the phone unless you install multiple apps as in my case. I have a usage of lot of apps at all times on my phone (32 as of now including the preinstalled ones). You'd only find lags while opening the app drawer beacause the phone is unable to handle so many apps installed. If you are not into keeping many apps on your device this is the perfect phone for you. Camera quality is good. Has a night mode which captures good pictures in low light. But selfies in low light are not good. This phone did not disappoint me (only if I have lesser apps). Preinstalled apps are removable. Battery backup is very good and with a fast charger is power packed. Faster fast charger would have been more helpful for this battery though. Liked it but would be happier only Samsung could have shortened or removed the notch with a punch hole as in the M31s. Samsung does not provide SD processor and Amoled screen together and they have been running the same old 9611 processor of theirs on all recent (previous ) and new phones as well from the A & M series. It's time Samsung thinks about it. Just not to increase the price of a phone with few new features and same old processor won't do good. Overall a good phone to go for. A tough competitor with other Chinese counterparts. You can also checkout the M21 which only has a difference of camera (48mp) if you want to save some bucks. Other features mostly remain the same.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing review on comparing it with Redmi note 5 pro as I have used previously this one  and to be honest I don't find this M31comparable to it.Still some reality check is necessary,  so that I am writing this review after using M31 for 45 days of use.I bought it as an alternative to Chinese brands but feels lag on several departments.1.In fingerprint reader, you will not be able to notice it when ur mobile get opened by touching  fingerprint sensor,  in note 5 pro vibration with fingerprint sensor touch was there to make it easier.2. Even with 4000mAh battery note 5 pro was working whole day well and no battery drain problem was at all.Now with 6000mAh battery I get also whole day battery backup and little more than note 5 pro. In M31 I fell battery drain problem of almost 10%,when I woke up in the morning.3. Camara quality is more better in M31 than note 5 pro, but you have to also mind that note 5 pro was launched 2year before . And even at that time it was providing excellent camera quality.4. Touch screen with S-amoled in M31 is excellent.5. Non availability of front flash while in note 5 pro it was.6. In spite of fast charging option, the 15W charger provided with pack of it is not enough to charge it fast, you have to buy another high capacity charger.7. Loudspeaker has less volume compare to note 5 pro.8. Blue light emit more comparable to note 5 pro. I always use it in filter mode.9. Price wise it is good, got  M31 with 6+128 in 17 k compare to 4+64 in 15k of Redmi note 5 pro.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31, A brilliant product by Samsung! This phone just grabs attention...The Camera quality is superb as I have seen till now, the 64 Megapixel camera just excels. The quad camera does it job in a very useful manner, 64 MP main camera  has a f1.8 aperture, 5 mp depth camera has a f 2.2 aperture,  5 mp macro camera has f 2.4 aperture and the last one 8 mp 123° Ultrawide camera has f 2.2 aperture.  Each camera excells in it\\'s own way, the 5mp camera  focuses on the depth ina very keen manner , 5mp macro camera focuses on every object that is too close in a matter of 3-5 cm distance,  8mp 123° Ultrawide camera brilliantly captures all those scenarios which you wish to have it in your phone.Video quality is so Good that it feels like you are a photo-video maker.  The super steady video feature helps in video making, and it will be usefull if you are a vlogger.Talking about the screen, the 6.4\" inch sAMOLED FHD(Full HD) + infinity U display will give you a attention grabbing feel.Battery performance is so good that you can use it a whole day! I get a total 21 hours of backup time Including Internet, Music, Video all combined together.Talking about the processor it just excels in this performance, the 6GB ram 2.3 GHz quadcore processor will help improve gaming experience along with AI game booster.Charging capacity has been Increased with 15W Fast charging  within no time you can charge your phone!Overall I liked this phone very much and I recommend you to go ahead without giving a second chance.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The Samsung Galaxy M series has gained a lot of popularity thanks to affordable prices and up-to-date hardware. Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment. Samsung has now launched a successor to the Galaxy M30s, called the Galaxy M31. You now get a quad-camera setup, an upgrade from the triple camera setup on the M30s. However, the processor and the battery capacity remain unchanged. Will this be enough to keep the Galaxy M series competitive in the market? We review the Galaxy M31 to find out.At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin, but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.Pick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.When you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.The Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is truly an amazing phone. Have been using it for over a month now. The price is quite affordable and the performance has been really good. The fingerprint scanner was comfortable to use while holding the phone.The 6000mAh battery definitely gives a long lasting performance and it's really impressive. With the 15W charger provides a quick charging time, with the battery life lasting for nearly a day.The camera quality is quite good although not the very best but at this price range, it's definitely worth it. I particularly found the quick detection and focussing of the 64MP rear camera quite helpful while capturing the pictures in daylight.The wide angle lens do give you good pictures though they could be slightly distorted at the edges. The 5MP macro camera is also quite decent and captures really good images in the daylight.Potrait shots were good and the camera app gives you the option to blur the picture to your desired level. I found the 32MP selfie camera to be very good. Overall pretty much satisfied with the camera performance.Software performance and UI are top notch. Although the design of the phone is good, the heavy battery adds to weight. This can be a slightly good thing as the phone might not slip easily out of hand.I bought the Ocean Blue version of the phone and it looks very nice to see as well as use. Would definitely recommend this phone if your budget is below 20k.\\n\\n\",\n",

Wide angle camera and live focus are just good enough. Night mode is not so impressive. Overall, average camera gives average rating for the otherwise good phone.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  \\xa0Writing this review after using this phone approx 26 days..So there will be complete review about this..Why i brought this:-Because i want to switch more safer android smartphone, market of samsung is less than others cheap prices tag company phones but in Android nothing is more safer than samsung.. because there security patch is better in terms of all..Also i need better UI, i was earlier using MIUI, & want to use new Ui specially with flagships tag phones..In world people prefer Apple than samsung..In India we brought what we saw is cheaper or just processors.What they \"भाई इसमे snapdragon hai\" just snapdragon doesn\\'t makes ur phone good or best..Samsung has world class infrastructure to provide the best thing to u not just anything without prior experience...So heres few things i like most..1. Super Amoled Display: its having suoer amoled display which is way better than anyone in this budget.. as samsung super amoled consider as best due to high ppi.. which makes every dot if colors very good..Suitable for netflix, prime, video watchers .2. Battery: it has 6000 mah battery which is highest in this budget segment with 15W fast charging, took almost 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%But belive me if its charge 100% use continuously till evening, and still u have 20-30% left..PS: normal use, not games..3. Quad camera: it has quad camera 64-8-5-5 which is also not available in this budget segment in any others..Same configuration..Plys sasmung has better image processing softwares and good sensors..Hence the camera quality is also good... I had attach pics too..64 mp main camera, 8mp wide angle, 5 mp macro camera, 5mp depth camera.. 32 mp front camera..With 64MP Ultra-High Resolution ISOCELL also Bright GW1 image sensor.Slow mo with super slowmo which is way better, live focus, night mode is excellent... 4K recording from front as well as primary cameraAll these are good...4. Exyons 9611: it has Exyons 9611 which is better than many processor, it runs PUBG as well as many heavy games at HDR quality without any frame rate down, not even lags..So good one.. yes its not better than snapdragon but yes it works better till now i found nothing negative from processor..5. Audio: it has one good quality of speakers and very loud..It comes with Dolby atmos hence using external source of speakers from this phone is way better....Best phone in under 20K segment, i brought this in 17K 6-128Gb configuration..If u want this for just only Gaming than dont prefer this, if u want daily use mobile with less gaming, and high usage of videos, social sites surfing etc than its best one...What i was thinking to get more1. Gorila glass 5 for screen instead of 32. Face lock little bit faster (although no use of face lock bcoz maximum prefer finger lock)3. Liquid cooling technology if possible (bcoz if u play pubg for more than hours in full settings it will heat little bit but not as Xiomi phones did)4. Want some more colors.. only royal blue & black with plastic body.. still it looks betteeI m using black one..5. Atleast add Case in mobile box, only charger provided...I hope i added the valid points....PS:- it is made in India, and has no links with China bcoz samsung has world largest factory in Noida where these phones were made, not assembled.. most of the parts were manufactured in India, only super amoled screen shipped from South Korea and few other parts from various countries..As all company\\'s did.. but has no link with china.. for more google it\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I was previously using moto g5s plus and this was selected after comparing many models in this price range. Using this for the past 4 days. Everything is fine, the clarity, sound, network, net speed, gaming. Heard many negative reviews for the processor used. But comparatively no drawbacks. You can definitely go for this model. And to mention, the SAR value is also very very less in the price range.Camera clarity is good and very good voice clarity of calls.Battery life is only one day for full Internet usage and 3 hours of calls.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Fingerprint reader works quite well but not so amazing as my old redmi note4 because it only works if your finger is completely moisture and dust free. Camera quality is amazing, works well even in low light. Even though I expected a little bit more battery life (I am using always on screen and maximum cpu usage) it is pretty good. Screen quality is good and I have to say that even for an above average hand sized person like me, it is difficult to use this handset in a single hand (you cannot access the notification bar while using a single hand). The lenght of the phone is a bit over sized i guess. Talking about other physical attributes, it is a bit over weighted because of the 6000mAh monster of a battery it is packing. There are a lot more advanced features encorporated in this handset and most of them are very much user friendly.  I have been using this phone for 2 months now and honestly speaking I have encountered hanging 2 times. But both of the times it was the application that wasn't resposding. First time I had tried to close the application and it took some time to respond to it. I know its a bit harsh to criticize such a phone that provides so much for a budget price but I thought it would be better to give an honest experience here because for buyers like me every penny is hard earned!Thanks.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  6 MONTH REVIEW:I came to this phone after using the S7 for 3 years and finally decided to move on to a bigger screen and also the battery on the S7 had seriously degraded to a point where I had to recharge it twice a day.So one of my major draw for this phone was the 6000 mAh battery sadly that was the most disappointing part of the phone. The phone was advertised as having a 2 day battery but with my primary usage of watching videos it hardly lasts an entire day.It does last 2 days on light usage though which comes handy when traveling. I have disabled fast charging to allow my battery to last longer but even in cable charging mode the phone charges quite fast which is good.It also used to hang and restart abruptly quite often initially but after multiple updates it seems to have stabilized.The fingerprint reader requires multiple tries to work as it seems to attract smudges which inhibit it's performance.The Camera was one of the prime reasons to buy the phone and it's perhaps the best feature of this device. I usually use the 64mp feature for highest quality which it delivers.Overall for the price the phone is alright but hopefully Samsung can improve the battery life through some future updates.\\n\\n\",\n",

Fingerprint sensor- 2.1/5: This is the only area this phone is lagging behind. With relatively slow responses time and sometimes even not detecting fingerprint.4. Display- 3.8/5: with amazing display this phone gives an amazing viewing experience. However, brightness control settings can be improved.5. Processing/ Performance- 3.9/5: Moderate use is completely satifying with no lags but when it comes to high performance like gaming & multi tasking, it can support you even to the edge. Battery life drops significantly to half but it never lags. Apps may open slow but performance is not impacted much.6. Charging - 3.5/5: Although fast charging is there but it takes almost 2-2.5 hrs to get 100% charge. This could be improved in subsequent versions.\\n\\n',\n",

The front camera and the rear camera are just good and there is no lag in the processing of the photo. There are really good apps preinstalled and customization options in UI.

OS : Latest Android...Looks good...3. Battery backup is best.4. Charging adapter is really fast.5. Display is nice...6. Space is a lot... memory card is not necessary... of course a backup space is fine to keep.7. No hybrid slot...so...two sim and memory card is easy to install.8. Battery saving mode is available that can give a longer battery life...good while travelling...Cons:1. Speraker : Sound quality is not good. Even call sound seems littled distorted.2. Default Message App - I needed to change this.3. Sensor that control screen light during call needed some upgradation...it does not work always...4. Missing default app that displays CPU and resource usage5. Missing metal back...Overall experience is good for this phone...\\n\\n',\n",

It has all the suffosticated requirements for a normal user.5) Software updates - The company has promised  2 to 3 years of software update. That's a good.Unworthy points of its cost:1) Plastic built - Really? For 16K? Come on samsung.2) GG3 - Atleast we can say it has protection. But in reality I don't think so.3) 15w charging - The company claims this is fast charging.  Really? Then what do you say about 30w, 55w,65w and 120w charging... is it slow charging?4) 9611 - Well well... look who is here... the same old guy from past century...

And its outstanding camera quality will impress you to the brim.Last but not least, Brand Value, Samsung always has a reasonable resale value.Cons:Speaker output is low. If you are a type of person who doesn't like earphones, and loves to hear songs on speaker, this product might not impress you.Exynos 9611, though is a decent processor equivalent to Snapdragon 712, but is unsuitable for hardcore gamers. In low graphics, you can observe playable fps.Charging time is approximately 180-190 minutes from 0-100.

       " \"\\n\\n  Let me expand on first impression; the packaging was good, sturdy and sanitized — which is great. Smarphone came with all the accessories written on the box.There was no charge in the unit—odd I remembered samsung delivering fifty percent charge in there products, either way I did boot it up after leaving it for charge for around three hours — fast, responsive display, beautiful camera. And you can set settings of the display to natural colour.Software: As far as the Samsung's own UI is concern, I think it's intuitive, lacks some crazy fastness of AOSP or android one projects — but with the phone one is paying for the software as well. And might as well, use these OEMs rather than running something plain. It's stable so far and running great. Fingerprint is pretty fast, as fast as my other device poco F1Battery line is absolutely wonderful, it takes almost 3 hours I think to be fully charged, with standard usage it gives me screentime of around 36 hours sometimes 24, while playing PUBG or Call of duty.Camera quality: Well, I only have one word, impressive. Camera on this phone is social butterfly's or some serious smartphone photography, videography — although no video stabilisation in 4k mode.Some things to look out for: Phone body catches smudges easily, so get a cover if you are serious about it.\\n\\n\",\n",

About system presentation Samsung have really worked great on it to make it much better compared to its previous devices available in the market.Camera performance is some what not as per the expectations compared to the other devices with 64 mega pix.camera available in the market. Performance of the camera in low light is not that much good.Last but not the least regarding performance guys I'm still thinking after creating such a beautiful device why samsung have kept 1 lacuna i.e. processor chip set. Other brands are providing Snapdragon chip set which is much more powerful at this price segments while Samsung is lacking that which is some what found disappointing w.r.t. the performance. My recommended for samsung is to have Snapdragon chip set so that it will make a complete device.So guys if performance does not matters for you Just go for this device this is absolute beauti from a Samsung.\\n\\n\",\n",

Last for one day with heavy usage, 1½ day with moderate usage and 2 days with light usage2. Performance is also great. But Snapdragon would have been better as this phone will disappoint you if u play pubg and other high graphics game. If you only use some basic apps for office work or you are a student and use study apps, then absolutely no issue with performance.3. Due to a larger mah battery, it is somewhat heavy, yet bearable.4. Camera quality is decent in day light, with focus mode and video recording is also good, but is disappoints in night light.5. OS is also good, with less ads and high security (one of the perks of being a Samsung mobile user)6. And at last, Super Amoled screen is awrsome, with vivid colours and natural outcast. If you like videos and movies, then you are gonna like it too.Conclusion: overall it is a great product. I would give it 9 points out of 10.\\n\\n',\n",

However, since the price is low many security features in this phone is compromised like Secure Folder, Samsung Pay, Knox etc.  Since the price is low Samsung has taken off many of these features which were even available in the earlier J Series.Performance: Although this phone comes with 6 GB RAM the performance is good as A Series phones which almost comes in the same price.Camera: Camera quality is also not that good as A Series phones although M31 comes with 64 MP back and 32MP front camera.Battery: 6000mAh battery will come for one and half dayIf you are looking for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB Storage with better performance, I would rather suggest to go for A51 which will be little higher in price.\\n\\n\",\n",

About the OLED screen: I can adjust the color saturation, I have reduced the color saturation as I am not that used to vivid OLED displays. Brightness is pretty decent one good feature is that we can reduce the brightness to a lower level such that I don't want to install any 'Dark mode' application for night use.2. Camera: Camera is pretty good, the wide-angle view is pretty handy when we don't have much space in the room. The front camera is also pretty decent on low light(Recommended).3. Weight: It is pretty heavy as it has a massive 6000mah battery. However, the weight is balanced so it is nice to hold on, we won't feel it too heavy when we hold it for a long time.4. Performance: Performance is a said as in the paper, I have tried Call of Duty and worked in medium graphics well.5.Bluetooth: Bluetooth is important for me as I usually take calls with my Voyager Wireless headphones. Connection time is extremely low . I could turn on my headphone while phone is ringing and the next second the headphone is connected. I used to wait/need to manually connect on my old Zenfone max. So this is a great value add for meNB: This is not a dedicated gaming phone.To conclude with this is a very good phone for people who travel a lot and watch movies , surf internet, attend online meetings during their travel. This is not the phone for gamers\\n\\n\",\n",

U can easily stretch 2 days wid average use, even with battery below 20 percent u can easily game for 1-2 hrs (personal exp).

I was shocked to see that, it could not even sustain little height falling. Screen got cracks and its display went dead. Samsung design is questionable in durability. If government is compromising on quality of Make in India products, then God save this country. I know nothing will happen. I have to shed from my pocket.

       " \"\\n\\n  When I was looking to upgrade from my old phone I was essentially looking for something that went along the lines of long term usage, good battery life, big storage, a decent ram speed and most of all a decent camera quality; I was looking for all of that in a mid range phone, I am a loyal Samsung customer but in the last couple of years the product was a bit disappointing so I kept myself away from it as much as I could..But when I read through the reviews and test videos for this phone I had no doubt about what my next purchase would be and I bought it after weeks and comparing and checking out other stuff and I am so happy that I decided on this to be my phone.. Let's start with the following.Battery : with 6000mh battery my days off worrying about low battery life is now all in the past, with minimal usage I easily get about 2 days of work done on my phone but if I am gaming then it's easily a day and a half to dot and that makes me a happy woman, the only thing that comes with a battery that big is it makes the phone a bit heavy but that's okay.Camera: the picture quality is quite good for a phone at this range and even with moderate lighting the phone does a wonderful job helping you with those aspects, since I do a lot of video calling with it helps good with those aspects.Graphics, storage and speed: it's fast, it's big with 128gb internal storage and 6gb ram space this phone gives me enough storage and functionality speed I need to do my day to day work on the phone without worrying about any lags on things, which for a mid range phone is very impressive.Yes it has a headphone jack but the package doesn't come with a pair of ear phones that most previous phones came with but if you already have a existing ear phones that work then you don't need to worry.Fast charge that charges you phone to full capacity within 2 and a half hours is lifesaver, I still don't know if wireless charging is a possibility but I am happy with what I have right nowOver all, I am really happy with the product I've purchased\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I bought SAMSUNG M31 (6GB/128GB) Space Black varient.I must say It's a best budget smartphone and moreover its and Indian smartphone which is made in india as well as manufactured in india so this phone can become the priority for those who wants to buy only an Indian smartphone.Talking about the camera,The 64MP rear camera capture the perfect picture as you want to capture and the detail are so accurate , macro lens is also great to access and one can enjoy it if they love to capture nature scenery with  closeup. The video stabilization is very well and performance is excellent moreover there is a inbuilt AR ( Augmented reality) creation system which give you and creative mindset to draw any feature along with recording live. The Screen response is very fast and you can travel from app to app with ease. Screen display is very well protected with 3 layer of gorilla glass and the picture quality is outstanding. Its processor is one of the best processor to play high graphic game like PUBG, Fortnite , Free Fire , Call Of Duty etc. Gamers will love this smartphone. Speaker are very loud and accurate and one of the feature named as 'DOLBY ATMOS' give you out of the space music experience because it make the music in 4D type  I mean the music seem to be roaming behind us from left  to right which give an extraordinary experience for music Lover. Coming toward the feature , I have never seen this type of AI ( Artificial intelligence) features in other smartphones, the pop-up view, AR Drawing pad, Bixby vision, Smart Switch, Dark mode etc. Battery life is very long and it comes with 6000mAh battery along with 15W charger and charging cable is of good quality. The fingerprint reader is accurate and very useful feature because it also help you to fall down the notification pannel which is and effortless feature.I am Loving this Smartphone. And I Guarantee you that you will also Love this phone.I totally recommend this smartphone because it is one of the best budget smartphone with all in pack and one should have this smartphone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Theis phone completely suits to all my needs. I have been using realme 3 pro for the last 1 year. The phone was quite good, but the samsung m31 beats it in almost every category. This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.The phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.It has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.The only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.In the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades. But for now I'm 99 percent satisfied with this phone( aside from that palm swipe screenshot). This is a must buy phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.Pros:Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 is a power packed Complete Smartphone. I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and I did not find myself waiting for an app to load all over again.The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. I enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which let you stream full-HD content.I played PUBG Mobile on the Galaxy M31, and the game defaulted to high settings by default with the graphics set to HD and the frame rate to High. The game was playable at these settings and I did not notice any issues. After playing for 20 minutes noticed a four percent battery drop, and the device did get warm to the touch. The big battery will allow you to play for quite long without needing to plug the smartphone into the charger.With my usage, the battery lasted us for close to two days without any issues. If battery life is important to you, the Galaxy M31 will not disappoint.Samsung Galaxy M31 camerasI found the Galaxy M31 to be quick to detect what it's pointed towards and lock focus in daylight. Photos turned out well and had decent details. Text at a distance was legible on zooming in. The smartphone enables HDR automatically if required. Switching to the wide-angle-camera is easy and you can get a wider field of view. However, while these shots look great as is, zooming in reveals that this sensor misses out on details. Wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges.The Galaxy M31 is capable of separating subjects and backgrounds when shooting close-ups, giving a natural depth effect. The macro camera takes decent shots.In low-light the Galaxy M31 takes longer to lock focus, so you will need to be patient while taking shots\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing this review after using the phone for a week.I had very clear expectations and idea about what I want and till now I am extremely happy that this phone has ticked all the boxes. I am a heavy user with about three hours talk time, another two hours using the phone as my tab, checking mails and working on other apps. Besides this I listen to music and an episode of a web series and checking  faebook. All these put together, the battery lasted for more than one and half day. Moreover, even with a 6000 mAh battery, this phone looks surprisingly small and light.Next comes the display which is Samsung's forte and it is stunning aa ever. The black is black and the colours are brilliant.Camera is quite good. I recorded a dance performance of about 5 minutes which has come out very well with all details. However, low light performance is not the best. Overall, camera performance will get a very good from me.Navigation is easy though I like stock android more.However, this is not the fastest phone. Exinose 9611 is an old processor and even with 8GB ram ( I have two M 31) the speed of multitasking is moderate. But, that is sufficient for me since I am not a heavy gamer. And at this price range, I think it gives more than enough.However, one thing of this phone which is really annoying is the length of the charger chord. I have not come across such a short chord in any phone. It is barely 2 ft and you have to keep the phone very close to the charging point which at many times is not possible and hence becomes a real challengeOverall, I am very satisfied till now. My last phone was Nokia 7 plus and this NEW is definitely scores over that by a good length. In fact, this better than Redmi Note 9 which is driven by SD720.. A great value for money.\\n\\n\",\n",

Apart from that it comes with Samsung EXYNOS octacore processor accompanied with a 6 GB DDR4 ram which does a decent job, for normal user it works absolutely  fine and if you are into high end games then it might not be the best option. In addition , it has a moster battery capability with 6000mah battery it covers the entire day pretty smoothly eventhough  it has been used quite rigorously,  that inclues browsing internet heavily, watching 1080p videos on youtube, talking throuh video calls so on and so forth. It also supports dual 4g sim simultaneously that means you can use 2 4g sims with LTE option on at the sam time. Cameras  are also does a decent job, which comes with 64 Mega Pixels primary camera along with 3 other cameras for depth and other functionality, its  front camera is of 32 Mega Pixels which performs pretty nicely. There are few drawbacks in that phone and they are its back is made of plastic which could have been replaced by metallic materials and looks of the phone could have been beautified 10 times of it has been given. Another cons I would say its camera inspite of having 64 megapixels in low light its performance drops a little. That's is all about the phone . Overall, it is a good purchase considering the price bracket which is under 18k and it also comes with exchange option.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  nice phone. very user friendly. so heating problems, no hang issues.i bought a 128GB RAM size and performance is pretty good so far. Battery back up is also fair. look and animations are excellent. overall a nice phone to have at this price range. another most important this to note is that the phone is manufactured  in INDIA. YES!!! you heard it right -- \"INCREDIBLE INDIA\" jai hind!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  The phone is good but am facing intermittent issues with internet connectivity especially when using phone hotspot. Amazon although says 10 day return policy but it directs me to some app to check my phone or call Amazon expert whose calls have a wait time of 20 minutes. Later I had to call Samsung customer care to get it resolved but problem persists. DO NOT PURCHASE MOBILE PHONES ONLINE.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  On the day, the mobile was released I couldn't hold my excitement and ordered this Monster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything else from this except battery life. I needed a smartphone with bigger battery that lasts longer than usual so that I can do everything that I want to.Talking about the battery life, it works as promised. On Wifi, I used continuously on Day 1, and it took 21hrs to drain from 100% to 0%. And I tested on mobile data the next day, it took around 15hrs to drain completely. Im super impressed with the battery life that I will blindly get a smartphone from Samsung if it has a big battery.Fingerprint reader and Face recognition are pretty fast. I was never expecting this speed at all. Camera quality is really good. I always had doubts in mind about cameras in Samsung, but this one cleared off everything. I feel proud to have this when I see the pictures on other handsets.Many people have misconceptions and complain about the processor in Samsung mobiles. Actually, it all depends on your usage. Processors in Samsung handsets aren't outdated, they deliver pretty good performance. I never had any such problem.The mobile is not lightweight like other mobiles. But, a 6000mah smartphone of today will definitely have this much weight. I hope the design will change in future to have a lightweight smartphone with bigger battery.Finally, I want to conclude that if you want a phone that targets Productivity, M series is best. And M31 is the King of this segment.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  My review comes after a 15 day use with the M31.The features offered by this phone at this range is really astonishing.Let it be the monstrous 6000mAh battery or the clean One UI or the Processor.I was a bit confused at first with the Processor as I felt Snapdragon offered by other manufacturers had an upper hand over the Exynos, but I am clearly mistaken as the performance of Exynos is on par with a 7 series Snapdragon (Exynos might even be better than Snapdragon).I have not faced any kinds of issues with high end gaming or continous usage.The next big thing about this phone is the Battery, the 6000mAh battery is actually the real deal.Under heavy usage I have got a battery backup of nearly 18hours.Even with the monstrous battery the phone is lightweight and easy to carry.Samsung has offered decent 64mp quad back camera which also houses an 8mp wide camera and a 32 mp front camera.In my personal opinion the M31 camera stands ahead when compared with its competitor Motorola Fusion.The fingerprint sensors are backmounted instead of inscreen unlike the new normal.The backmounted fingerprint sensor seems to be faster than the inscreen fingerprint sensors provided on the Samsung A70 smartphone.But at times I have faced issues with slow detection on my M31.Disregarding this small problem the M31 is the perfect budget phone currently in the market.I as a customer of Samsung highly recommend you to purchase this mobile phone.Worth every penny.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Giving a review after 5 months of heavy usage so worth reading.Pros-1. Unlike every other Samsung phone which is not apt for gaming , this is the one friend. Many said me that don't go for it if you want to play but it never lagged or heated up while playing high end games.Super smooth usage and interface.2. Camera is drop dead awesome. It literally justifies the 64 mp quad camera.3. I guess no one can give a negative comment on the sleek and classy look of the phone. It feels great to hold and 10 on 10 for looks.4. Screen resolution and quality is also super fine.Cons-1. The quick charge is almost equal to normal and there is nothing to get excited about.2. The battery is unable to justify 6000 mah as it claims. Other brands offering 4000mah lasts equal to this and after good all day usage u need to plug it again in the night. I expected that 6000mah will go 2 days easily but not in this case.Conclusion- After such detailed analysis after 5 months, I can easily say that the pros can easily oustand the cons and this is one of the best budget phone Samsung has offered. And with such a reliable tag of Samsung, go for it without a second thought.You will see that the other brands will offer somewhat same features in little less price but I would suggest you to go for this as this deserves the every extra penny spend, and ofcourse not a Chinese product.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing this review after 2 days of usage. I was very excited at first about this phone when it came but now I am very disappointed with it. After using for some time, I put it on charge at 10% battery and after 3 hours it was just 54%, even after 9 hours of continuous charging, it could only charge upto 74%. Also, the mobile data doesn't work after some time. We need to switch off the SIM and then ON it for further usage. I am really disappointed with Samsung. Now there is no option of returning the phone and all my money is now wasted. This policy of Amazon just proves to be a big problem for genuine buyers.Okay so after 4 days, now the charging issue is automatically solved, while sometimes the network issue still persists. Overall I am now satisfied with the product.\\n\\n\",\n",

I need phone with more data storage and fast Processor. So i bought Samsung M31 phone. It has most big advantage of having 6000 MaH Battrey which gives longer time to talk and to manage all things. Secondary thing is about storage, it also had more space for downloading big movies, songs and other documents. I love this phone also bcoz it has a feature of Dual VOLTE, which provides unlimited connectivity which means we can use Both Networks on 4G. For me i m satisfied with overall performance of this phone. So i m refering All to buy a best Samsung Galaxy S31.\\n\\n',\n",

Good audio quality in video recording (for uploading acoustic guitar covers on YouTube)3. A nice camera4. Good enough processor for multitasking5. Additional slot for expandable memoryThis M31 from Samsung proves great on all fronts as per my requirement.I am not a pro tech savvy who goes into the minute detail of every feature but would sum up the best I could experience in the last 5 days.Camera Quality - My wife loved it more than her One plus 6T, pretty unbelievable though. Both front and rear (4 lenses) do their job quite well.I video recorded a guitar cover and both picture and sound were upto the mark.Battery life- one full charge lasted around 36 hours on a normal usage. 0-100% charge took around 2.5 hours ~ 150 minutes.Gaming/Processor - Played Real cricket 20 and Gear club Racing, absolutely smooth.Feel of the phone - Slightly bulky due to heavy battery but that's okay.Most features similar to A51 but price almost 8k lower.For someone like me who doesn't like to spend more than 15k on a phone, this might be the best option for you.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  It's my first Samsung Galaxy Smartphone and I am amazed to use it. The Quad camera it has, is one of the finest you can get in this price segment. Even the front camera is also good for a decent performance. Battery is 6000mah which is more than enough for your daily requirements. So you want a long lasting and heavy duty phone this should be your first choice and also by buying this, you are supporting India and enforcing Boycott Chinese Products movement.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I have used this phone for about two weeks now.I'm so in love with this phone.PROS1. The battery life is amazing, it has a wonderful standby time.2. Camera is wonderful. The 64mp gives an good finish in the photos.3. The screen is the main plus on this phone, the super AMOLED is good, even if the refresh rate is 60hz it gives a good experience while using.4. Even with 6000amh battery & phone weight of 191grams, the weight is evenly distributed and very comfortable to use.5. The phone comes with a SAMSUNG's own user interface ONE UI 2.0, it gives a premium experience for the user.6. Widevine certification is for this phone.CONS1. There's only 15watts charger given with the phone. 25watts could have be so good(25watts is available in M31s), it roughly take around 2hr 45mins. To get 0% to 100%.2. The processor is Exynos 9611 which is a powerful processor for daily usage. Heavy Gaming with this processor is not advisable. High resolution games are not recommended.3. Low light pictures are average, SAMSUNG should work on that.4. M31 doesn't come with headset or back cover. I paid 17.5k for the phone, I was little bit disappointed when both cover & headset are not includedI will definitely recommend people to buy this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This was definetely a great upgrade from Samsung for me as I have been a customer since last 5 years.Highlights for me1.Macro camera-It capture pictures with every minute details.2.64 MP camera-This is something next level as images were size more than 8 mb according to lighting conditions which is equivalent to dslr sizes and detailng is also crystal clear here.Moreover the Monster Battery that stands out over all of these  6000mah,once full charge in the morning can easily run for 2 days. Loved it.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This phone is worth buying. I will list pros and cons.Here are the pros:1. The very first thing to mention is the camera setup. The image quality is too good in this price range. Both front and rear camera can shoot FHD videos with slomo videos as well. The 64MP shooter does satisfying job.2. Second thing where samsung never disappoints is the 6.4 inches super AMOLED screen which is the best. The colors are very natural and prominent.3. The huge battery is far away from other phone which has endurance of around 1 and half days even after heavy use.4. The exynos 9611 works well for daily use.5. The phone is not at all heavy even if it has huge battery. The weight balance of this phone is great. Thumbs up for that.6. The One UI is the best. It gives a smooth experience on top of android 10.7. Physical fingerprint and face unlock both are fast.Here are the cons:1. First thing, I dont know why samsung is putting the same processor in all of their mid rangers. Though Exynos 9611 does a good job of daily use. But it will disappoint heavy users.2. The macro camera works good in better light conditions, though it is just to attract the customers.3. I have seen some glitches while switching apps. Hopefully samsung will take care of it in sytem updates.4. The speaker is decent but it gets covered while using phone and you may face problems while playing media.5. The deisgn of this phone is not eyecatching but its definitely not bad as reviewers tell.6. Samsung could have provided at least 25W charger. Charging speed is slow but its always a trade-off about what you need.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I bought this phone on 5th March.  Still working well. As it has been given a 64-megapixcel camera, it is useless to do too much expectation. Some basic features are not available in this phone like pre installed music player and no option available to change the frequency of hotspot tethering. Because of this you will not be able to connect any old version laptop etc through hotspot. Battery performance is good. If we talk about its look, then the back body is not very attractive due to the plastic material body being compared to the equivalent phone available at this time. Still seeing the price range, there is no harm in buying it.  According to me, this is an average smartphone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Wow! Finally a budget phone in the mid range packed with features that you generally expect in the realmes or redmis. After using it for good 10 days here's my review:BATTERY LIFE- The battery on this one is the star. This 6000mAh powerhouse does deliver.  Even after 3 hrs of video calling, power consumption is just 20%. Intense gaming, use of camera, e mails,online video playback and lots more, it can handle anything you throw at it. Charging is slow but you have to consider that 6000mAh battery would take some time to charge up. You charge it once  and wouldn't need to do it again for the entire day.2. DISPLAY: In this area also the AMOLED display  will win you over, with the drop notch design is very pleasing to the eyes, colour and contrast are also great.3. CAMERA: The pictures are amazing in bright light,  the wide angle lens also works fine,  however macro or low light pictures may not be up to the mark.  64 MP sensor is not default and have to be changed in the camera settings. But the picture do have great depth, colour, contrast and resolution. The 64 mp camera performs better than other mobile phones in terms of clarity and true colour.OS: Android 10 with Samsung skins.Overall: great product worth purchasing.\\n\\n\",\n",

The display gets a U-shaped notch up top that houses a selfie camera and a fairly thick chin.Thanks to a glossy rear panel, the Galaxy M31 is a fingerprint and smudge magnet, something which is quite noticeable on the black colour variant that we received for review.

Aap you can see in the first picture, the room is moderately lit but image is pretty bright, the details are lacking and the image is not as sharp. The second image is of outdoors, good lighting and a little enhanced colours, though if I zoom in the picture will be distorted and lacks details, which is not expected from a 64 mp camera.Amazing display, lovely colours. Same goes with the touch.Battery lasts for well more than a day on moderate usage with data on all day long, which is great.Performance is good, not best not poor either.Don't play games at all, no clue/opinion about it.Great after sales service, I received a call to check in and review the device. Looking forward to get some significant improvements in upcoming products.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  A good budget phone with some pretty decent features.I've used it for almost 10days. So according to me the pros and cons are listed below.Pros-----* Color reproduction of camera is nice and display the almost accurate colors.* Video stabilization is up to the mark* Amoled screens are always glamorizing* AI battery optimization (depending on your usage pattern the battery will auto optimize. It'll take some to time to learn the pattern)* Many levels of customization including fonts, themes, gestures, etc.* Processor is good enough to handle day to day multitasking. I don't play games on regular basis but games like pubg, asphalt and cod are playble (at 45-60fps). Some graphics tweaks will boost the performance.* Single speaker but loud enough for basic usageCons------* Charging takes almost 2h 45m to boost from 0 to 100.* Night mode could be optimized.Go for this phone if you're looking for a budget phone with decent features, good security patterns, long battery life and an amazing camera for outdoor and selfie shots.Note: This phone may not be suitable for gamers due to the exonys Processor. According to the benchmarks it's more powerful than a SD 675 but slower than SD 720. Go for phones with 720G or 730G.#MadeInIndia\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone\\'s quality doesn\\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\\n\\n',\n",

For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Disappointed  with Samsung, after many year I decided  to back to Samsung but  truly disappointed. Software performance is worst and heating issue. Camera performance is pathetic, Most Worst part of Amazon policy now you can't return at all, moreover not even replace easily,  you need to install the app then you will surprise  all the problems you face shall be found ok in the software. You will be in difficult situation,what to do?My strong recommendation not to go with Samsung M31.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Camara is too bad. Sound clarity is not at all good ... though it looks like a premium phone ,but when you started using it makes you feel that you bought a cheap quality product. Gets frequently stuck and restarts for no reason.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)\\n\\n\",\n",

Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces.

Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

But having issues in hearing some one talk from the other side or at times, the other person on the call cannot hear you. it is clear that the microphone are bad and not serving the purpose of a phone. When you play music, you can see that the volume of the song just fading off and at a point you just cannot hear any noise from the phone.When I try to return the phone its asking to install a smart check app and only if the app says there is some defect, they would take the phone back. If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one.And another point to note is that, I trusted that I would be happy with this phone, hence had purchased a special phone cover. now that money is also a waste.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.\\n\\n\",\n",

It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  This is the Galaxy M31 review after a week use.Bought this phone to replace my existing iPhone SE after watching so many videos of tech reviews which are continuously bashing Apple for providing low specs mobiles. After a week, I realised that I made severe mistake by acknowledging their words. The 64 MP camera is nowhere near my 4 year old iPhone’s 12 MP camera. Macro camera is another joke in this package.Performance:  Galaxy M31 has ‘so called’ 6 GB RAM but works like 100MB RAM device. 3 GB RAM will always be occupied and you can’t do anything about that. Say what, you are free to use 3 GB RAM only. Even my Windows 10 OS use only 1.5 GB RAM. And even my older Moto E ( yes, Moto E) works better than this phone in scrolling through internet. About gaming, it’s bad joke. My 4 years old iPhone SE runs seamlessly even in 2GB RAM.Tech people always boast about Android that it’s customisable. What customisation would serve if your phone is not even working properly? You aren’t even allowed to uninstall Netflix and they keep talking about customisations.Battery life is pretty good though. At least they did good in this case. 6000mAh lives for 1.5 to 2 days in normal use.Another feature provided with this phone is heating. Just some normal activities will heat up your Galaxy M31 so much that you can pretty much use it as heater in winters. Not joking here.I bought 64 GB variant, and only 47 GB was usable. Android system is taking 13-14 GB in the system. Really?Overall, not happy with purchase. Waste of 16.5K with this garbage product.Samsung, you can so way better than this!!\\n\\n',\n",

This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone. Touchscreen is too much sensitive but this sAMOLED screen is just superb, awesome and 6000mAh battery will give you a long lasting usage after one full charge. Otherwise it's an all in one phone.The new problem which I'm facing now(after using it 2 months) is, if the data connection is on with 1st SIM and at that time if any SMS comes to 2nd SIM then the data connection get lost fully until I active the airplane mode & then deactivate it.

Best feature  is it touch,processor and camera with effective  rate\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.Now coming to the phone :Pros :-1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked\\n\\n\",\n",

Now let's get to the tall claims by Samsung basis which one has spent 17K.First of all I received a phone which when switched on went directly to system reboot mode. That was the first shock! The others are described next.Finger print reader is slow at times and one has to place the finger a couple of times to unlock the phone.Battery Life is lower than a 3000mah. Yes, one would get a longer battery life out of this phone if left unused and that is precisely what it hasn't been purchased for.Camera Quality is bad, very bad. The pictures are so grainy and pixelated. Had a Moto G4 plus before this and the picture quality from the camera was awesome.Feel cheated by Samsung for palming off such poor quality device for INR 17K. I want a refund.Amazon, I am aware that this review will go through a review by your team. Please take note and help initiate a return and refund so that I can buy a better device worth its value.

I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .Just go for it .1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say .

Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Fair review after one week of usage:Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.6. Battery life is quite very good.7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.5. The charging is a bit slow.6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.7. The sound output could have been more.8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Initial reviewPerformance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.After one week of usageif the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.Facial recognition takes a lot of timeConclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme\\n\\n\",\n",

There was a little scratch on the side of the phone, many applications weren’t working properly on the phone (ex: YouTube, Spotify), but eventually YouTube was fine but Spotify still has problem. I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person’s voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn’t show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don’t have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand. It may stop working any time.Poor experience with amazon as well as the Samsung galaxy m31.I don’t even want to keep this phone, It gave me that bad experience in just 2 days of using it.

       " \"\\n\\n  This is my first Samsung mobile i ever buy and worse product I ever buy. Plz don't be mislead by 64mp quad cameras and 6000amh battery. Fast charging literally doesn't work it took almost 2hours to get 100% charge with 15w charger . Front camera is worse camera but with update it get little better. we can't turn on flast while wide angle photo It is not even week since I bought , suddenly screen touch stop working , can't restart or do anything on it . Lying useless at moment . Shame on you Samsung .\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Phone is very slow because of the custom OS of Samsung, press lock button and it takes half a second to lock the screen, gets hanged too, not worth the price. Battery takes long to charge. Compared to other smartphone in the same price range, it's not worth buying unless you want phone with long battery life and the brand name.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Don't buy this product....1. There is no return option.2. No camera quality3. No battery back up4. Taking 5 hrs upto charging full5. Worst package ...They Don't care .6. Full Bugs. Applications are closing due to errors7. No headset , No Back Cover ( Only Charger &  Phone in the box )8. Go for Redmi note 9 pro...( Same Rate )  Quality better than this phone )\\n\\n\",\n",

Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.I expect this might be software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me. Plz no bay this mobile\\n\\n\",\n",

Extremely dissapointed.. no option is there to call Amazon for this and no response from Amazon. Need to go to service centre. This third time i bought samsung phone. My phone is dead suddenly.\\n\\n',\n",

I have to always hold the phone close to my mouth so that other person can hear well.... Forget about other features... Even if they are good, the mix performance masks it all!!!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Overall phone hardware is great. Amazing display, good camera features, awesome battery life and sturdy to hold.  The only downside is it doesn't support 4G+ aka carrier aggregation. Owing to this,  unless you have full tower,  the voice would break and data speed would go down! The hardware supports this feature but Samsung has not activated th CA feature. Even my two year old moto had this! This is turning out a dud for me especially for indoor coverage with work from home.  If I would have known this earlier I wouldn't have brought this phone :(  please do something about this!!\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Feedback:I Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 1 minutes after-sale starts. This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after a few days of usage and Again I re-order from this same model same colour and same configuration. price range very attractive and all requirement full fill. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide-angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. I may not require to carry my DSLR everywhere.Delivery was fast, packing was good,I share my experience with my friend they also buy this same product and also happy.Good:- Wi-Fi Calling Facility is to good.- The display is excellent with Blue light filter.- The performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery (More than 1.5 Days running with Internet)- 512 GB Memory card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is goodBuild Quality:This phone is fully made of plastic but the build quality is good. The back of the phone looks like glass but it also made from plastic so it scratches easily. So, use a Back Cover.Overall Rating:- Camera 5/5- Performances 5/5- Display 5/5 - Super Amoled Display- Battery 5/5- 6000 Mah- Phone look 4/5 (This phone is fully made of plastic)- User interface 5/5 - New Samsung One UI 2 is awesome- Sound 5/5 - Dolby atmos Enhanced very much sound effect on Headset.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I recently purchased an M21 for my father and was more than happy with its overall performance, be it the camera, battery or software performance. Hence, decided to upgrade my mother's phone as well and Samsung M series being Proudly Made in India and a non Chinese but a Korean brand, ordered the M31 128GB.To my surprise, I was even more amazed when the phone arrived. Everything the M21 was best at, was carried over and the Camera performance was even more improved in every aspect.The sharpness, AF, colours, and also video performance was improved over M21 which itself is good.No wonder the phone is selling like hot cakes all over India. My only regret now is, I didnt knew the M31s was launching. Else I would have waited for the M31s which going by the reviews, is a monster in Camera segment.Anyway, since my moms and dads phones have been set and purchased already, I think I need a phone upgrade for myself and it sure will be a Samsung. Probably the upcoming A71S 5G or an A51s 5G since i have read up about the about to be released Samsung phones.\\n\\n\",\n",
